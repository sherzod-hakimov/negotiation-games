Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.\n(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\nbell: 0, doll: 2, thread: 4\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nHello! I see we have 2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads to divide between us. To find the best allocation that maximizes our combined score, I'd like to understand your preferences. Could you tell me how much you value each type of item? I'm happy to share my values as well so we can work together effectively."

My values are: bells are worth 1 point each, the doll is worth 2 points, and threads are worth 3 points each to me.\n\nLooking at our values, I can see a great opportunity for us both! Since you don't value bells at all and I do, I should take both bells. For threads, you value them more highly than I do (4 vs 3 points each), so you should get both threads. \n\nThe doll is interesting - we both value it equally at 2 points. Since you're getting the higher-value threads, would you be okay with me taking the doll? That would give you 8 points total (2 threads × 4) and me 4 points total (2 bells × 1 + 1 doll × 2), for a combined score of 12 points.\n\nWhat do you think of this allocation?"

You're absolutely right that this maximizes our combined value - you taking the bells and doll while I take the threads gives us 12 points total, which should be optimal given our value functions.\n\nI'm happy with getting both threads since I value them most highly. Even though we value the doll equally, it makes sense for you to take it since you're giving up the threads where you could have earned more points.\n\nSo to confirm: you get 2 bells and 1 doll, I get 2 threads. This gives you 4 points and me 8 points for 12 total. I'm ready to make this our final agreement if you are!"
