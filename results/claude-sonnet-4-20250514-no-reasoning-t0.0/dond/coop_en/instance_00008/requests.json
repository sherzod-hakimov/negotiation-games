Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.\n(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\nscissors: 1, thimble: 6, fork: 1\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nHello! I see we have 3 scissors, 1 thimble, and 1 fork to divide between us. To find the best allocation that maximizes our combined score, I'd like to understand what items you value most. Could you share your preferences or which items are most important to you?"

The thimble has no value for me personally, so you're welcome to take that. The fork has some value to me but much less than the scissors.\n\nSince you want the thimble and I want the scissors, and there are 3 scissors available, how about I take all 3 scissors and you take the thimble? That leaves the fork - do you have any interest in it, or would you prefer I take it since the scissors are my priority?"

That way you get the items that matter to you, and I get the item that matters most to me.\n\nSo to confirm: you would take all 3 scissors and the 1 fork, and I would take the 1 thimble.
