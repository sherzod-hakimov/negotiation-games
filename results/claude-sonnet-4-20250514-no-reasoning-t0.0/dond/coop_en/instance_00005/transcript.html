        <p>I&#x27;m most interested in the fruits - they&#x27;re quite valuable to me. The chalks are somewhat useful, but the shoes don&#x27;t really matter to me at all. Since you mentioned you prefer chalks, maybe we can work out a trade where you get the chalks and I focus on the fruits? What do you think about the shoes - do they have any value to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great starting point! Since you value fruits highly and I prefer chalks, we&#x27;re already aligned on the main items. The shoes don&#x27;t have much value to me either - they&#x27;re my lowest priority. <br/><br/>So it seems like a natural split would be: you take both fruits, I take both chalks. For the shoes, since neither of us values them highly, would you prefer to take them, or should I? Or maybe we each take one shoe? I&#x27;m happy either way since they&#x27;re not important to either of us.</p>

        <p>Perfect! I&#x27;m happy with you taking both chalks and me taking both fruits - that works great for both of us. <br/><br/>For the shoes, since neither of us values them much, why don&#x27;t you just take both of them? It doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me, and it keeps things simple rather than splitting them. Does that work for you?</p>
