        <p>The plates aren&#x27;t very valuable to me at all, so you&#x27;re welcome to have those if you&#x27;d like them. It sounds like we both really want the coin though - that could be tricky since there&#x27;s only one. Since the coin is especially valuable to you, would you be willing to let me have both candies in exchange for you getting the coin? You could also take the lemons and plates since I don&#x27;t need those.</p>

        <p>That sounds like a reasonable trade! So if I understand correctly, you&#x27;re suggesting:<br/>- You get: both candies<br/>- I get: the coin, both lemons, and both plates<br/><br/>That works well for me since the coin is my top priority and I do value the lemons and plates. This seems like a fair division where we both get items we care about most. Should we go ahead with this arrangement?</p>
