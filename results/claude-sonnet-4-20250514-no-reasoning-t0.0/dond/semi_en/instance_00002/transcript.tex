	 That works out great! Since you want all 3 glasses and I want the shovel, we're off to a good start. As for the berries and bowl, I don't have a strong preference between them - they're about the same to me. Since you're getting the glasses which seem valuable to you, would you like to take either the berries or the bowl as well? I'm happy with just the shovel if that makes the split feel fair to you.
