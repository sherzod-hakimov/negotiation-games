You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 hat, 3 pens, 1 sponge\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\nhat: 4, pen: 0, sponge: 6\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nHello! I see we need to divide 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge between us. To find a good split, it would help to know what items you value most. What are your preferences among these items?"

That way you get the hat you want plus items that have some value to you, while I get my most preferred item. Does that sound fair to you?"
