While I do value the stick highly, getting all four of the remaining items does have appeal, especially since you've indicated the stick is worth more to you than all other items combined.\n\nThis is a tough decision for me, but I can see the logic - if the stick is truly that valuable to you, then this trade might work better for both of us than risking a failed negotiation where we both get zero.\n\nI'm willing to consider this deal: you take the stick, I take the towel, toy, and both boxes.
