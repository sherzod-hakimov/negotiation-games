Starting from a 9730-effort pack of top ratio items, I noticed we had 343 effort slack. The best single upgrade within that slack was swapping B23 (657) for B43 (997), which raises my total importance more than alternative swaps like A28->A94. This yields total effort 10070 (≤10073) and maximizes my utility among simple single-swap improvements. I also checked other combinations (e.g., A28->A94, A71->A96) and multi-swap options; none exceeded the B43 swap given the remaining slack. If the other side pushes back, my lowest-leverage items for me among those included are around the mid-tier (e.g., A28, B15, B37, C72), so I can trade one of those for one of their must-haves of comparable effort if needed, as long as we respect the effort cap.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'A87', 'A75', 'A08', 'C53', 'B69', 'C17', 'A65', 'C51', 'C82', 'B96', 'B19', 'B34', 'C72', 'B37', 'A25', 'A46', 'A71', 'A28', 'B15', 'A39', 'B16', 'C79', 'B43'}\nARGUMENT: {'This set prioritizes high impact per unit effort, includes all the most efficient small items, and uses the remaining slack to upgrade to B43 while still staying under the limit (total effort 10070, 3 to spare).

Every feasible swap either exceeded the effort limit or reduced my total utility (gains from new items were outweighed by the importance lost from multiple smaller items).
