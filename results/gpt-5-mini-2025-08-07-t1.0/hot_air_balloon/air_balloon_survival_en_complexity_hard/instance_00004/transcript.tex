Current proposal totals 6829 effort (≤ 6880) and gives me very high total value. I intentionally included virtually all low-effort, high-efficiency items to leave little wasted capacity. If they push for a different heavy item, I’ll try to trade out one of my lower-efficiency mediums (e.g., C84, B37, C72, C82, B16) rather than any of my ultra-efficient smalls.
