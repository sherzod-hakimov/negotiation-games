They have consistently insisted on A71 and C01, and have already conceded to include C54 while keeping my core B33/B32/A87/A77. Attempts to replace A71 with A04 or to include C17 were refused, and the remaining feasible swaps either risk key rejections or offer negligible gain. Acceptance now secures a solid outcome with high likelihood, whereas further countering could jeopardize multiple high-value items for me.'}\n\nAGREE: {'A77', 'B32', 'B35', 'A87', 'B33', 'C01', 'A71', 'C54'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'Agreed. This exactly matches the alternative we aligned on, fits comfortably under the limit (4761 ≤ 5138), and preserves the balanced structure we converged on. Thanks for working through the swaps to land here.'}",
