Then I explored combinations among A91(908,783), B82(716,780), C71(541,583), A98(276,262), A66(214,138), C75(675,389) to maximize total value within capacity. Starting from a strong base, I found two near-tops: {C50,B67,B72,C63,B24,C71,C22,A91,A98,A66} with value 5561 and effort 3457, and an improved swap removing C71 and A66 for B82, yielding {C50,B67,B72,C63,B24,C22,A91,A98,B82} with higher total value 5620 and lower effort 3418. I verified alternative swaps (e.g., reintroducing C71, adding C75, using B66/B62) all lowered value or broke the limit. So my proposal S2 is likely optimal for me and still leaves 69 effort buffer, offering flexibility to negotiate if the other side has must-haves. I will present S2 and justify it on efficiency and balanced coverage, while signaling openness to targeted swaps that maintain the limit.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'C50', 'B67', 'B72', 'C63', 'B24', 'C22', 'A91', 'A98', 'B82'}\nARGUMENT: {'This set delivers strong impact for moderate total effort (3418), keeping us safely under the 3487 limit with a small buffer. It prioritizes items that offer high payoff relative to their effort and avoids heavier options that would crowd out multiple efficient picks. I’m open to swapping one or two items if you have critical needs, as long as we stay within the limit and keep the overall efficiency of the set high.'}"

This set uses 3477 effort (still under 3487) and preserves core efficient anchors like C50, A98, C63, and B82. If B62 is a sticking point for you, I can consider swapping B62 for B66 plus B24 to keep the spirit of efficiency with only a small trade-off, or we can discuss a targeted swap if there’s a must-have you want to protect.
