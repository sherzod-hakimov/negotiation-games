        "response": "STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Their latest package is excellent for me: it includes all my top-value items (B12, A08, A16, A27, A66, B60, C15, B09, B94, B67, etc.) and fits under the limit at 8163. I checked potential swaps (e.g., reintroducing C34), but every feasible change would reduce my utility or break the capacity without further concessions. Since their current offer strictly dominates their alternative (A05→A58) for me, the best move is to lock this in now by agreeing.'}\nAGREE: {'A16', 'B45', 'C12', 'B12', 'A84', 'A27', 'A08', 'C81', 'A66', 'B46', 'B10', 'B09', 'C15', 'B67', 'A30', 'A05', 'B94', 'A89', 'B60', 'B00', 'A58', 'C92'}\nARGUMENT: {'This set cleanly fits the capacity (8163 ≤ 8170), preserves the strong core we’ve converged on—including B60—and maintains a balanced mix without any heavy, low-yield items. I’m satisfied to finalize on this configuration.'}",
