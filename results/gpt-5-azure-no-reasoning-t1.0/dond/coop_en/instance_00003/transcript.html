        <p>Hi! I value carrot=3, onion=3, bag=1. I’m aiming to maximize our combined score. What are your values? If you also like the high-value items, we can split them; otherwise I can take the carrot and onion and you take most or all of the bags. For example, one fair split could be: I take carrot and onion, you take all 4 bags.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. My values: carrot=0, onion=6, bag=1.<br/><br/>Given that, the highest total comes from me taking the onion (worth 6 to me, 3 to you) and you taking the carrot (worth 3 to you, 0 to me). Bags are low for both but still positive: 1 each for both of us.<br/><br/>A split that maximizes total and feels fair:<br/>- I take the onion and 2 bags (value to me: 6 + 2 = 8)<br/>- You take the carrot and 2 bags (value to you: 3 + 2 = 5)<br/><br/>Total combined: 13, which is the maximum possible.<br/><br/>If that works for you, I’m ready to lock it in. If you prefer more bags in exchange for me keeping the onion, I can do onion + 1 bag for me, carrot + 3 bags for you (my 7, your 6, still total 13).</p>

        <p>That makes perfect sense. I agree the max total is 13, with you taking the onion and me taking the carrot, and we just split bags.<br/><br/>I’m happy with your first split: you take onion + 2 bags, I take carrot + 2 bags. If you’re ready, I’ll lock in with that.</p>
