        <p>Hi! I value the items as follows: bucket = 4, each book = 1, mirror = 1. So total value across all items for me is 4 + 5*1 + 1 = 10.<br/><br/>To maximize our total combined score, it usually helps to give each item to the person who values it more. Could you share how you value bucket, books, and mirror? If you prefer not to reveal exact numbers, even just telling me which item you value most/least would help.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. I value the mirror the most by far, then the bucket, and I get no value from books. Specifically: bucket = 2, each book = 0, mirror = 8.<br/><br/>Given our values, to maximize total we should allocate:<br/>- Mirror to me (I value it 8 vs your 1)<br/>- Bucket to you (you value it 4 vs my 2)<br/>- All 5 books to you (you value them 5 total vs my 0)<br/><br/>If that works for you, say so and we can both submit matching proposals.</p>
