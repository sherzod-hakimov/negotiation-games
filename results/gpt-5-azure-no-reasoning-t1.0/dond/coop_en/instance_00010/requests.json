        "content": "Thanks for sharing. My values are: plier=0 each, chalk=2, nail=5, bucket=3.\n\nGiven our values, the nail is hugely valuable to me (5 vs your 2), and the pliers are valuable to you (2 each vs my 0). Chalk is slightly more valuable to you (3 vs my 2), and the bucket is slightly more valuable to me (3 vs your 1).\n\nA split that maximizes total value is:\n- You take: 2 pliers\n- I take: nail and bucket\n- Chalk could go to you (3) or me (2); total is higher if you take it.\n\nThat yields totals: you get 2*2 + 3 = 7, I get 5 + 3 = 8, for a combined 15. If you’re good with that, say so and I’ll submit a matching proposal."
