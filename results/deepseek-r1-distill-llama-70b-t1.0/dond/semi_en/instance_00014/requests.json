            "reasoning": "Alright, let's try to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation. So, the items available are 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My secret values are frame:8, shoe:2, hammer:0. That means the frame is super valuable to me, the shoe is somewhat valuable, and hammers are worthless. \n\nFirst, I need to communicate with the other player to split these items. Since hammers are worthless to me, I might not care about them much, but the other player might value them. The shoe is okay, but the frame is the real prize for me. \n\nI wonder what the other player's values are. Since it's secret, I don't know, but maybe I can hint or ask without giving away too much. Maybe I can express that I have a strong preference for the frame but am flexible with the rest. Alternatively, I could try to find out if the other player cares more about certain items.\n\nI should start by sending a message to the other player. Maybe I can say something like, \"I really want the frame. Would you be willing to let me have it if I let you have some hammers and the shoe?\" But I'm not sure if that's too direct. Maybe it's better to be a bit more strategic. Perhaps I can ask them what they prefer to see if they mention the frame or something else.\n\nAnother thought: since the hammers are abundant (3 of them), they might not be as valuable because there are so many. Maybe the other player would prefer as many hammers as possible, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe they don't value hammers at all and prefer the frame or shoe.\n\nIf I propose the frame for myself, maybe offer them the shoe and some hammers. But since I value the shoe at 2, it's better than nothing, but maybe the other player doesn't mind giving it up if they want something else more.\n\nWait, but if I send a message, the other player might respond, and we can negotiate. Maybe I should ask them what they prioritize. Alternatively, I could just propose a split where I take the frame and the shoe, and give them all the hammers. But then, the other player might not accept if they also want the frame.\n\nAlternatively, if the other player's value for the frame is higher than mine, they might not want to give it up. So perhaps I can negotiate a split where I get the frame, and in exchange, they get the shoe and two hammers, leaving one hammer for me. But since I don't value hammers, that's not helpful. So maybe I can just give them all the hammers if they let me have the frame.\n\nWait, but if I give them the shoe as well, maybe they value the shoe more. So I have to balance. My total value if I take the frame and shoe would be 8 + 2 = 10, and the other player would get 3 hammers, but if the hammers are worthless to me, but maybe valuable to them. If they value hammers, then they might prefer that. But if not, they might hold out for the frame.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe the best approach is to start by expressing interest in the frame and see how the other player responds.\n\nSo, I'll send a message: \"I have a strong preference for the frame. What would you like to get?\" Let's see how they reply.\n\nSuppose they respond that they also want the frame. Then we have a conflict. In that case, maybe I can offer something else, like the shoe, but I don't know if that's enough. Alternatively, I could propose a split where one of us takes the frame, and the other gets the rest. But since the frame is worth 8 for me, which is significant, I might not want to give it up easily.\n\nAlternatively, if they don't value the frame as much, maybe they'd be willing to let me have it in exchange for other items. But without knowing their values, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: since the total number of messages is limited (5 each), I should plan my messages carefully. Maybe first ask about their preferences, then based on their response, proceed.\n\nSuppose they reply that they don't care about the frame, then I can take it and maybe give them the shoe and hammers. But if they want the frame, I might have to negotiate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make an initial proposal to test the waters. For example, \"How about I take the frame and you get the shoe and hammers?\" If they agree, that's 8 points for me, and they get whatever they value from the other items.\n\nBut I shouldn't give away too much in the first message. Maybe better to ask first.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the hammers are worth nothing to me, perhaps I can offer them all the hammers if I can get the frame and shoe. But if the other player doesn't care about hammers, that might not be a good trade.\n\nAnother consideration: since there are 3 hammers, perhaps the other player can only take 3, but since each proposal is a number, they can take 3, 2, 1, etc. But if they take all 3, then I can take the frame and shoe, which is better.\n\nWait, but if I can take the frame and shoe, that's 8+2=10, leaving them with 3 hammers. If their value for hammers is high enough, that's a good deal. But if they don't want hammers, they might not accept.\n\nAlternatively, if they value the shoe more than the hammers, maybe I can offer them the shoe in exchange for the frame. But I don't know their values.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about possible strategies:\n\n1. Try to get the frame, and offer them the rest.\n2. Find out what the other player wants and negotiate accordingly.\n3. Propose a split that maximizes my value while giving them something they value.\n\nOption 1 is straightforward. Let me try that. I'll send: \"I'm interested in the frame. Would you be willing to let me have it if I take only that and let you have the rest?\"\n\nIf they agree, great. I get 8 points, and they get whatever they value from the other items.\n\nIf they refuse, then we need to negotiate further. Maybe they want the frame as well, so we have to split other items. But since hammers are worthless to me, I might give them all the hammers and the shoe, keeping the frame for myself. But that would leave the other player with 3 hammers and 1 shoe. If their value for the shoe is higher than the frame, they might not want to give up the frame. Alternatively, they might value the shoe less and take the hammers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the frame and a few hammers, but since hammers are worthless, it's better to give them all to the other player.\n\nAnother thought: since there's only 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers, the total items are 5. Each proposal is a subset of these, non-overlapping. So if I propose \"1 frame\", they can propose the rest, or some combination.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to secure the frame. So, sending a message expressing interest in the frame and offering them the other items.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the situation thoroughly.\n\nFirst, the items available are 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My secret value function is: frame is worth 6 points, shoe is 1 point, and each hammer is 1 point. So, clearly, the frame is the most valuable to me. The shoe and hammers are much less valuable.\n\nThe other player has already submitted a secret proposal. I don't know what they proposed, but I need to make sure that my proposal complements theirs so that our combined proposals don't exceed the available quantities. If both proposals are complementary, we each get points based on our own values. If not, we both get zero.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own score. So, I should aim to get the highest value items possible while ensuring that the other player's proposal can also be satisfied.\n\nLet me consider what the other player might have proposed. Since I don't know their value function, I need to think about possible scenarios. They could have gone for the frame, the shoe, or focused on the hammers.\n\n1. **Other player took the frame**: If they proposed to take the frame, then I can take the shoe and all 3 hammers. That would give me 1 (shoe) + 3*1 (hammers) = 4 points. But if I do that, wait, but maybe the other player also took some hammers. Hmm.\n\n2. **Other player took the shoe**: Then I can take the frame and the 3 hammers, giving me 6 + 3 = 9 points.\n\n3. **Other player took some or all hammers**: If they took 1 hammer, then I could take the frame, shoe, and 2 hammers, which would be 6 + 1 + 2 = 9. If they took 2 hammers, I could take frame, shoe, and 1 hammer for 8. If they took all 3 hammers, I get frame and shoe for 7.\n\nBut wait, I don't know their strategy. The other player might also be trying to maximize their own points based on their unknown values. So, perhaps they value the frame highly, or maybe they don't. Alternatively, they might prioritize other items.\n\nSince I don't have any messages exchanged, this is the first move after their proposal. So, I have to make a proposal without knowing theirs, but I need to make sure that both can coexist.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the other player has already submitted their proposal, and now it's my turn. So, I know that I need to make a proposal that complements theirs, but I don't know what theirs is. So, perhaps I should make a proposal that takes the items I most value while leaving enough for the other player to have a valid proposal, but I don't know their exact proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system will check if both proposals together are possible. So, perhaps I can try to take the most valuable items, and if the other player's proposal allows that, we both get points.\n\nBut the problem is that if I take the frame and maybe some other items, it might conflict with their proposal. For example, if the other player also took the frame, then both of us can't have it, so our proposals aren't complementary, and we both get zero.\n\nSo, my approach should be to take as much value as I can without overlapping with the other player's proposal. But since I don't know what they took, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nGiven that the frame is my highest value, I should try to take it. But if the other player also took the frame, then it's a conflict. Alternatively, maybe they didn't take it, so I can safely take it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other player took the frame, so I have to take the remaining items.\n\nWait, but the other player could have taken multiple items. So, perhaps I should think about the worst-case scenario where the other player took the frame, leaving me with the shoe and 3 hammers. In that case, my score would be 1 + 3*1 = 4. Alternatively, if I take the frame, and they took, say, the shoe, then we might conflict on the frame and shoe. But maybe they only took one item.\n\nWait, the other player's proposal is a set of items. So, for example, they could have proposed to take the frame, or the shoe, or some number of hammers. They might have taken multiple items, but there's 1 frame, 1 shoe, so they might have taken up to 3 hammers.\n\nSo, if the other player took the frame, then I can take the shoe and 3 hammers. If they took the shoe, I can take the frame and hammers. If they took some hammers, I can take the rest plus other items.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe I should make a proposal that takes the frame if possible, and then as many hammers as possible without conflicting. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me calculate the maximum possible points I can get without conflicting. Since I don't know the other player's proposal, maybe the optimal strategy is to take the frame and as many hammers as possible, leaving the shoe for the other player. But if the other player took the shoe, then perhaps that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player didn't take the frame, so taking it would be safe.\n\nWait, but the other player could have taken the frame, so if I also take it, our proposals aren't complementary, and we both lose.\n\nSo, perhaps the safer approach is to take the shoe and all hammers, leaving the frame for the other player. That way, if they didn't take the frame, we both get points, but if they did, we zero out. But that's not good because if I leave the frame, I get only 4 points, but if I take the frame, and the other player didn't, I get 9 points.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take all 3 hammers and the shoe, leaving the frame. Then, if the other player took the frame, our proposals would be complementary, and I get 4 points. If they didn't take the frame, then my proposal would include the shoe and hammers, but the frame is still available. But the frame is only one, so if I don't take it and the other player didn't take it, then both proposals are invalid because the frame isn't allocated, but I think the rule is that the proposals just have to be complementary, so if I take shoe and 3 hammers, and the other player takes the frame, that's complementary. If I take shoe and 3 hammers, and the other player took, say, 2 hammers, then we both took some hammers, but total hammers are 3, so if I took 3 and they took 2, that's 5, which exceeds the available 3, so it's not complementary, and we both get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player only took 1 hammer. So, I took 3, they took 1, but that's 4, which conflicts. So, we get zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take 2 hammers, the shoe, and the frame. Then, if the other player took the remaining 1 hammer, it's okay. So my proposal would be frame, shoe, and 2 hammers, which sums to 6+1+2=9 points. If the other player took 1 hammer, that's complementary. If they took something else, it might conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player took the frame. So, I can't take it then. So, perhaps it's safer to take the shoe and as many hammers as possible, but I don't know.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to take the frame and the shoe, leaving the 3 hammers. If the other player took all 3 hammers, then our proposals complement each other. Then I get 6+1=7 points, and they get 3 points (assuming each hammer is 1 for them too, but their actual values could differ). Alternatively, if the other player didn't take all 3 hammers, but took some, then we might conflict.\n\nWait, no, because if I take frame and shoe, that's 2 items, leaving 3 hammers. So, if the other player took any number of hammers up to 3, as long as their proposal doesn't include frame or shoe, we're okay. So, if they took all 3 hammers, that works. If they took fewer, say 2, then their proposal is 2 hammers, and mine is frame and shoe, so total items allocated: frame, shoe, and 2 hammers, leaving 1 hammer unallocated. But the rule says that the proposals need to be complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both. So, in this case, the total taken is 1+1+2=4, but the available items are frame(1), shoe(1), hammers(3). So as long as the sum of each type doesn't exceed, it's okay. So, if I take frame and shoe, and they take hammers up to 3, it's okay.\n\nBut if the other player took the frame, then my proposal of frame and shoe would conflict because we both took the frame. Then, the proposals aren't complementary, so zero points.\n\nAlternatively, if the other player took the shoe, then my proposal of frame and shoe would conflict on the shoe. Again, zero points.\n\nSo, in order to maximize my score, I need to take the highest value items while minimizing the risk of conflict. Since the frame is worth 6 points, which is significant, it's a big risk if the other player also took it, leading to zero. But the reward is high if they didn't.\n\nAlternatively, taking the shoe and hammers gives me 4 points, with no risk of conflict on the frame if the other player took it. But I might be leaving 6 points on the table.\n\nHmm. This is a tough decision. Maybe I should go for the frame and as many hammers as possible. So, my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 frame, 3 hammers]. That way, if the other player took the shoe, we complement. If they took the shoe and some hammers, but not more than 0 hammers (since I took all 3), then it's okay. Wait, but if the other player took the shoe and 1 hammer, and I took frame and 3 hammers, that would be 4 hammers total, which exceeds the available 3, so not complementary.\n\nWait, no. If I took 3 hammers, the other player can't take any hammers because there are only 3. So, if the other player's proposal includes any hammers, and I also took 3, then the sum would exceed, causing a conflict, resulting in zero.\n\nTherefore, perhaps taking 3 hammers and the frame is risky if the other player also took any hammers. So, maybe a safer approach is to take 2 hammers along with the frame, and not take the shoe. That way, even if the other player took 1 hammer and the shoe, we don't conflict.\n\nWait, but if I take frame and 2 hammers, the other player could take the shoe and 1 hammer. That way, our proposals are complementary, and I get 6 + 2 = 8 points, and they get shoe (1) + 1 hammer (1) = 2 points.\n\nAlternatively, if the other player took the frame, then my proposal of frame and 2 hammers would conflict, resulting in zero.\n\nAlternatively, if I take frame and shoe, then the other player could take up to 3 hammers, but that's 3, which is allowed. So, I get 6+1=7, they get 3. So, that's a safe way.\n\nBut wait, what if the other player took the frame? Then, we both took the frame, so we get zero.\n\nSo, to minimize the risk, perhaps I should not take the frame, but instead take the shoe and all hammers, which gives me 4 points, but it's safer. Or, perhaps, take the frame, shoe, and 1 hammer, so that the other player can take up to 2 hammers. That way, if they took 2, we complement. Or if they took fewer, we still complement.\n\nWait, let me think about possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose:\n\n1. [1 frame, 1 shoe, 1 hammer]: Then, the other player can take up to 2 hammers. If they took 2 hammers, that's complementary, and I get 6+1+1=8, they get 1+1=2. If they took 1 hammer, then they could take something else? But there's only frame, shoe, and hammers. Since I took frame and shoe, they can't take those. So, if I took frame, shoe, and 1 hammer, and the other player took 2 hammers, that's 1 (frame) +1 (shoe) +1 (hammer) for me, and 2 hammers for them. That works. If they took the frame, then we conflict on frame, so zero.\n\nAlternatively, I could take frame, shoe, and 2 hammers, as that would be 6+1+2=9 points. Then, the other player can take up to 1 hammer. If they took 1, that's complementary. If they took the frame, we conflict. So, it's a 50-50 chance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take only the frame. Then, the other player can take the shoe and 3 hammers, giving me 6 points, them 4. But if I don't take the frame, and take shoe and hammers, I get 4, but the frame is left, so the other player must have taken it.\n\nWait, no, the other player already submitted their proposal. So, if I take the frame, and they also took the frame, we conflict. But if I take only the frame, and they took the shoe and 3 hammers, that's okay, and I get 6, they get 4.\n\nAlternatively, if I take only the frame, and they took, say, the frame and some hammers, then we conflict, getting zero.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I think the optimal strategy is to go for the highest value, the frame, and as many hammers as possible without leaving the other player unable to take anything else. But I don't know their proposal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should take the frame and shoe, giving me 7 points, and leave the 3 hammers. If the other player took all 3, that's fine. If they took fewer, it's still fine, but perhaps they took the frame, then we conflict.\n\nI think the best move is to take the frame and the shoe, and 0 hammers. That way, I get 7 points, and the other player can take all 3 hammers, which is 3 points. If the other player didn't take the frame, then it's complementary. If they did, we both lose.\n\nWait, but if the other player took the frame, then my proposal of frame and shoe would conflict on the frame. So, I get zero. But if they didn't take the frame, I get 7. Alternatively, if I take just the frame and shoe, and they didn't take the frame, that's good. If they took the frame, it's bad.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the frame and 2 hammers, giving me 6 + 2 = 8 points. If the other player took the shoe and 1 hammer, that's complementary, giving them 1 + 1 = 2. If they took the frame, we conflict.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the frame and 3 hammers, which is 6+3=9. If the other player took the shoe, that's complementary. If they took any hammers, we conflict, getting zero.\n\nI think the safest bet is to take the frame, shoe, and 1 hammer, so that if the other player took 2 hammers, we're good. If they took the frame, we conflict. So, 50-50 chance of getting 8 or 0.\n\nAlternatively, just take the frame and shoe, leaving 3 hammers. If the other player took all 3, then I get 7 and they get 3. If the other player didn't take the frame, that's good. If they did, zero.\n\nAlternatively, to minimize the risk, take the shoe and all 3 hammers. So, 1+3=4. If the other player took the frame, we complement, and I get 4. If they didn't, perhaps they also took some hammers, leading to conflict, but I think in this case, if I took all 3 hammers, and the other player took any hammers, then the total would exceed, so we get zero.\n\nAlternatively, take shoe and 2 hammers, leaving the frame and 1 hammer. Then, if the other player took the frame and 1 hammer, that's complementary, I get 1+2=3. If they didn't take the frame, perhaps they took shoe or hammers.\n\nThis is confusing. I think the best approach is to take the frame, shoe, and 2 hammers. That way, if the other player took the remaining 1 hammer, we're complementary. If they took the frame, we conflict, but at least I tried for the highest value.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to take the frame and shoe, leaving the hammers. Then, if the other player took all 3 hammers, that's okay. I get 7 points. If they didn't take the frame, we're good. If they did, we both lose. It's a risk but with a higher reward.\n\nAlternatively, to take the frame alone. Then, the other player can take the shoe and 3 hammers, giving me 6. If they took the frame, zero.\n\nI think I'll go with taking the frame, shoe, and 2 hammers. So, [Proposal: 1 frame, 1 shoe, 2 hammers]. That leaves 1 hammer, which the other player can take.\n"
