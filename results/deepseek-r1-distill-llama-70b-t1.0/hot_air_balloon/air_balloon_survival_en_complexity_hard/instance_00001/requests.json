The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

            "reasoning": "Alright, let's dive into this negotiation game. My goal is to maximize the total importance of the items I keep while staying within the effort limit of 8145. I don't know the other participant's importance values, so I'll have to make strategic decisions based on my own and anticipate theirs.\n\nFirst, I'll start by listing out all the items along with their effort and my importance values. This will help me sort and prioritize.\n\nLooking at the effort and my importance, I notice that some items have high importance but also high effort. For example, B96 has an importance of 997 but requires 901 effort. On the other hand, A25 has an importance of 834 with an effort of 738. That's a bit high, but maybe worth considering.\n\nI should probably aim for a mix of high importance and lower effort items to maximize the total. Let's calculate the efficiency (importance per effort) for each item to see which ones give me the most bang for the buck.\n\nCalculating efficiency:\n- A08: 1059/963 ≈ 1.10\n- B95: 300/204 ≈ 1.47\n- A39: 514/418 ≈ 1.23\n- A65: 1057/961 ≈ 1.10\n- B81: 334/238 ≈ 1.40\n- B34: 719/623 ≈ 1.16\n- A28: 140/44 ≈ 3.18 (Wow, that's high!)\n- C82: 729/633 ≈ 1.15\n- B69: 343/247 ≈ 1.39\n- A87: 741/645 ≈ 1.15\n- B64: 326/230 ≈ 1.42\n- B15: 346/250 ≈ 1.38\n- C79: 827/731 ≈ 1.13\n- B16: 501/405 ≈ 1.24\n- C53: 485/389 ≈ 1.25\n- C83: 312/216 ≈ 1.44\n- C10: 733/637 ≈ 1.15\n- A97: 252/156 ≈ 1.62\n- A25: 834/738 ≈ 1.13\n- C84: 403/307 ≈ 1.31\n- A71: 858/762 ≈ 1.13\n- B23: 833/737 ≈ 1.13\n- B96: 997/901 ≈ 1.11\n- C51: 465/369 ≈ 1.26\n- C17: 98/2 ≈ 49 (Extremely high, but very low effort)\n- B19: 826/730 ≈ 1.13\n- C72: 818/722 ≈ 1.13\n- A94: 800/704 ≈ 1.14\n- A46: 411/315 ≈ 1.31\n- B43: 551/455 ≈ 1.21\n- B37: 606/510 ≈ 1.19\n- A88: 271/175 ≈ 1.55\n- A96: 788/692 ≈ 1.14\n- C60: 246/150 ≈ 1.64\n- A75: 128/32 ≈ 4.00 (Also very high efficiency)\n\nLooking at these, A28, A75, C17, and C60 stand out with extremely high efficiency. These should be my top priorities because they offer a lot of importance for little effort. \n\nI should include as many high-efficiency items as possible without exceeding the effort limit. Let's start by selecting them:\n\n- C17: effort 2, importance 98\n- A75: effort 32, importance 128\n- A28: effort 44, importance 140\n- C60: effort 150, importance 246\n- A88: effort 175, importance 271\n- A97: effort 156, importance 252\n- B95: effort 204, importance 300\n- B64: effort 230, importance 326\n- B81: effort 238, importance 334\n- C83: effort 216, importance 312\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the total effort doesn't exceed 8145. Let's add these up:\n\nCalculating total effort for these: \n2 + 32 + 44 + 150 + 175 + 156 + 204 + 230 + 238 + 216 = Let's add step by step:\n\n2 +32=34\n+44=78\n+150=228\n+175=403\n+156=559\n+204=763\n+230=993\n+238=1231\n+216=1447\n\nSo, total effort so far is 1447, which is well under the limit. But I can probably include more high-efficiency items.\n\nContinuing down the list:\n\nNext high-efficiency items:\n- C51: 369, 465\n- B15: 250, 346\n- B43: 455, 551\n- B34: 623, 719\n\nAdding C51: 369. Current total would be 1447+369=1816. Still way below limit.\n\nThen B15: 250, total becomes 1816+250=2066.\n\nB43: 455, total 2066+455=2521.\n\nB34: 623, total 2521+623=3144.\n\nStill under. Next, items like A39: 418, 514. That would bring total to 3144+418=3562.\n\nThen, A46: 315, 411. Total 3562+315=3877.\n\nThen C53: 389, 485. Total 3877+389=4266.\n\nA25: 738, 834. Adding that would bring effort to 4266+738=5004.\n\nThat's still within the limit. Next, C84: 307, 403. Adding that: 5004+307=5311.\n\nA87: 645, 741. Total becomes 5311+645=5956.\n\nThat's still under 8145. Next, B96: 901, 997. Adding would take us to 5956+901=6857.\n\nRemaining effort is 8145-6857=1288.\n\nThinking of next best items. Let's see:\n\nC72: 722, 818\nC79: 731, 827\nB19: 730, 826\nA65: 961, 1057\nA71: 762, 858\n\nThese are all high importance but high effort. Let's see if I can include some of them.\n\nTrying C72: effort 722. 6857+722=7579. Remaining: 8145-7579=566.\n\nFrom remaining items, perhaps B19: 730 is too much, as 566<730. So maybe smaller items.\n\nLooking through, perhaps A94: 704, 800. 704 is over 566, so can't include.\n\nA46 is already included. Maybe A71: 762 is too much. So perhaps C79: 731 is too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A25 is already included. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's see what's next in efficiency. After B96, I think the next is A25 which is already included. So perhaps the remaining items are high effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider including some lower effort items that I haven't picked yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me tally up the current selection:\n\nItems included so far:\n\nC17, A75, A28, C60, A88, A97, B95, B64, B81, C83, C51, B15, B43, B34, A39, A46, C53, A25, C84, A87, B96.\n\nLet me check total effort again:\n\nC17: 2\nA75: 32 → total 34\nA28: 44 → 78\nC60:150 →228\nA88:175→403\nA97:156→559\nB95:204→763\nB64:230→993\nB81:238→1231\nC83:216→1447\nC51:369→1816\nB15:250→2066\nB43:455→2521\nB34:623→3144\nA39:418→3562\nA46:315→3877\nC53:389→4266\nA25:738→5004\nC84:307→5311\nA87:645→5956\nB96:901→6857\n\nYes, total is 6857. Remaining: 8145-6857=1288.\n\nNow, I have a remaining effort of 1288. Looking for the next best efficiency.\n\nNext in line would be C72 (effort 722, imp 818), which fits because 722 < 1288. Adding that would bring total effort to 6857+722=7579, remaining 566.\n\nThen, with 566 left, perhaps C79 (731) is too big. Next, let's look for items under 566 remaining effort.\n\nLooking through the remaining items, perhaps C10:637, which is just over 566. So can't include. A94:704 is too big. A71:762 is too big.\n\nSo perhaps include C79 isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps include a combination of smaller items.\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let me list all remaining items not yet selected:\n\nLooking at the initial list:\n\nItems selected:\n\nC17, A75, A28, C60, A88, A97, B95, B64, B81, C83, C51, B15, B43, B34, A39, A46, C53, A25, C84, A87, B96.\n\nRemaining items:\n\nA08, A65, B69, B16, C79, B19, C72, A94, B37, A96.\n\nLet me check their efforts:\n\nA08:963\nA65:961\nB69:247 (not selected yet)\nB16:405\nC79:731\nB19:730\nC72:722\nA94:704\nB37:510\nA96:692.\n\nWait, B69:247 - was it included? Let me check.\n\nEarlier selection: B69 wasn't in the list. Wait, in my initial selection, I had up to B96. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the initial selection, I included B95, B64, B81, etc., but missed B69. Hmm. Let me recalculate my initial list because I think I missed some high-efficiency items.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial selection.\n\nWait, my initial approach was to include the highest efficiency first, but perhaps I missed some high ones.\n\nWait, B69 has an efficiency of 343/247≈1.39, which is high. I should have included it earlier.\n\nSimilarly, B16:501/405≈1.24, also high.\n\nSo perhaps I missed including B69 and B16 earlier, which could have been included in the initial selection, allowing for a better total.\n\nLet me recast the initial selection to include these.\n\nLet me re-sort all items by efficiency descending:\n\n1. C17: 98/2=49.0\n2. C60:246/150≈1.64\n3. A75:128/32=4.0\n4. A88:271/175≈1.55\n5. A97:252/156≈1.62\n6. B64:326/230≈1.42\n7. C83:312/216≈1.44\n8. B81:334/238≈1.40\n9. B15:346/250≈1.38\n10.

The only remaining items with effort ≤126 are perhaps none. Wait, checking the list again.\n\nWait, let's see if any small effort items were missed. C17 is already included. A75, A28, etc., all included. B95 is included. A97, B64, B81, etc., all included.\n\nSo, with 126 effort left, no more items can be added. Thus, the total effort is 8019, which is under the limit.\n\nLet me list all included items:\n\nC17, C60, A75, A28, A88, A97, B95, B64, B81, C83, B69, B15, C51, B43, C84, A46, C53, B16, A39, B34, A25, A87, B96, B37.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. C17\n2. C60\n3. A75\n4. A28\n5. A88\n6. A97\n7. B95\n8. B64\n9. B81\n10. C83\n11. B69\n12. B15\n13. C51\n14. B43\n15. C84\n16. A46\n17. C53\n18. B16\n19. A39\n20. B34\n21. A25\n22. A87\n23. B96\n24. B37\n\nThat's 24 items. Total effort is 8019, leaving 126 unused.\n\nThis selection maximizes my total importance as per my calculations. Now, to present a proposal including these items, but I should check if the total effort is indeed under the limit.\n\nBut wait, let me recalculate the total effort precisely:\n\nC17:2\nC60:150 → total 152\nA75:32 →184\nA28:44 →228\nA88:175 →403\nA97:156 →559\nB95:204 →763\nB64:230 →993\nB81:238 →1231\nC83:216 →1447\nB69:247 →1694\nB15:250 →1944\nC51:369 →2313\nB43:455 →2768\nC84:307 →3075\nA46:315 →3390\nC53:389 →3779\nB16:405 →4184\nA39:418 →4602\nB34:623 →5225\nA25:738 →5963\nA87:645 →6608\nB96:901 →7509\nB37:510 →8019\n\nYes, total effort is 8019, which is within the limit.\n\nNow, I should consider that the other participant might have different priorities, so they might refuse this proposal. I need to be prepared to negotiate and perhaps remove some lower-importance (to me) items to make room for others they value more.\n\nBut for now, my first move will be to propose this set, as it maximizes my benefit. I'll also need to defend it if the opponent refuses, arguing based on the high efficiency and total importance.\n"

The user provided a response that didn't start with the required STRATEGIC REASONING tag, which is a violation of the game's rules. Let me figure out a way to assist them effectively.\n\nFirst, I should understand the game's structure and rules thoroughly. The user is playing a game where they and another participant must agree on a set of items, each with given effort values, without exceeding the effort LIMIT of 8145. Each has their own importance values for the items, which are hidden from the other player.\n\nThe user's initial message included a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT but didn't start with STRATEGIC REASONING, which is mandatory. My task is to guide them to correct this. I need to structure a new message that begins with STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by the existing PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT.\n\nSo, I'll start by outlining the reasoning: prioritizing high-importance, low-effort items. Then, list the proposed items, ensuring the total effort doesn't exceed the limit. Finally, include the argument highlighting the efficiency of the selection.\n\nI should make sure the response strictly follows the format, with each tag in uppercase, followed by a colon and space, and the content in curly braces. Also, it's essential to mention that this is the beginning of the thought process, so the content in the response should be non-empty.\n\nI should also consider that the user might be new to this game format, so clarity is key. By restructuring their message correctly, I help them adhere to the game's rules and enhance their chances of successful negotiation.\n"
