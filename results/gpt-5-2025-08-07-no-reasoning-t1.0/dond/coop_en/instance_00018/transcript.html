        <p>I value each item equally at 2 points. Since total items are 5, the maximum joint score is 10. Any division that uses all items will achieve that. I’m happy with any fair split. For simplicity, how about you take the coin and one envelope, and I take one envelope and both potatoes? That gives each of us 5 points. If you prefer a different split, propose one that uses all items and gives us both 5.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the clear proposal. Your split gives you both potatoes and one envelope, and me the coin and one envelope. That yields me 3 points and you 7, not 5–5, given my values: coin 2, envelope 1, potato 3.<br/><br/>To make it fair at 5–5 while using all items, here are two options that work for me:<br/><br/>- Option A: I take both potatoes (6 points), you take the coin and both envelopes (6 points for you with your values). That’s 6–6, also fine since we’re maximizing total.<br/>- Option B: I take one potato and the coin (5 points), you take one potato and both envelopes (5 points for you).<br/><br/>I prefer Option B for exact 5–5 symmetry. If you agree, say so and I’ll submit a matching proposal. If you prefer A, I’m also happy with that.</p>
