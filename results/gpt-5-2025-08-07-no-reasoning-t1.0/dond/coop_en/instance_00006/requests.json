Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 potato, 1 glove, 2 rulers, 1 whistle, 2 cards\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\npotato: 7, glove: 0, ruler: 0, whistle: 3, card: 0\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nHi! I’m aiming to maximize our total points. My preferences (from highest to lowest) are: rulers (most valuable), then glove/whistle/card about equal, potato is worthless to me. What are your priorities? If you share your values or relative preferences, we can quickly split to maximize our combined score.\n\nInitial idea to start discussion:\n- I’d like the 2 rulers if you don’t value them highly.\n- I’m happy for you to take the potato.\n- We can divide glove/whistle/cards based on your values."

My values are: potato 7, whistle 3, glove 0, rulers 0, cards 0.\n\nGiven that:\n- You highly value rulers; I value them at 0 → you take both rulers.\n- I highly value the potato; you value it at 0 → I take the potato.\n- You value glove/whistle/card about equally; I only value the whistle (3) and glove/card at 0.\n\nProposed split to maximize total:\n- You take: 2 rulers, 1 glove, 2 cards\n- I take: 1 potato, 1 whistle\n\nThis gives me 10 points and gives you whatever your values are on the rulers/glove/cards, and it seems strictly Pareto efficient given our preferences. If that works for you, I’ll lock in."
