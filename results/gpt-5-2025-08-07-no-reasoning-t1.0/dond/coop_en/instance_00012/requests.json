Here’s my valuation: rulers = 3 each, eggs = 0 each, battery = 1.\n\nGiven that, a split that maximizes our combined total would be:\n- You take the battery (worth 3 to you, 1 to me) and the 2 eggs (worth 4 to you, 0 to me).\n- I take the 3 rulers (worth 9 to me, 3 to you).\n\nTotals: you get 7, I get 9, combined 16. If that works for you, say so and we can lock complementary proposals. If you prefer a tweak, I could take all 3 rulers and the battery (total 10 to me) while you take the 2 eggs (4 to you), combined 14—but the first split is better overall."
