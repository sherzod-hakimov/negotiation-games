I’d like to maximize our total points together. Here are my values: hook=3, bowl=2, plate=1. Given that, hooks are most valuable to me.\n\nIf your values are different, could you share any strong preferences? For a starting point that should be near-efficient, how about:\n- I take the 2 hooks (since I value them highly),\n- You take the 1 bowl,\n- And we split the 2 plates 1–1 (or you can take both plates if you value them more).\n\nIf you prefer, propose your values or a counter-allocation that maximizes total value for both of us."

So the bowl is extremely valuable to me, plates are worthless to me, and hooks are modest.\n\nGiven our values, an efficient split is:\n- You take both hooks (high value to you, low to me).\n- I take the bowl (very high value to me, moderate to you).\n- Plates go to you if you want them (they’re 0 to me, 1 to you).\n\nThat yields total value: you get 3+3 from hooks plus up to 2 from plates; I get 8 from the bowl. This seems Pareto-efficient. If you agree, I’ll submit that as my proposal."
