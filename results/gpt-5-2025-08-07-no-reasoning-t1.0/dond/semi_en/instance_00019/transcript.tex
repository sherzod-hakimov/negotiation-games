	 Thanks for laying that out. Here are my values: I care a lot about threads and the picture, and I don’t get value from bolts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given that, both of your options work for me:\\ \tt - You take the picture and 1 bolt; I take 2 threads and 2 bolts.\\ \tt - Or, you take just the picture; I take 2 threads and all 3 bolts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since bolts don’t matter to me, I slightly prefer you take only the picture and I take the rest. If you agree, I’ll lock that in. Otherwise I’m fine with your first split too.\\ \tt \\ \tt [Proposal: 2 threads, 3 bolts]
