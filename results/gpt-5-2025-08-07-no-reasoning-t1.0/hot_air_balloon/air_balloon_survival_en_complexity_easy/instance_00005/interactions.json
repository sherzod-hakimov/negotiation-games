Well under 9475, so feasible. My total importance for these: sum = B85 400, C15 781 (=1181); B12 915 (=2096); B60 808 (=2904); A27 822 (=3726); A08 868 (=4594); A16 856 (=5450); C12 668 (=6118); C81 713 (=6831); A30 739 (=7570); B09 786 (=8356); B67 780 (=9136); B46 606 (=9742); C70 968 (=10710); C34 484 (=11194); B10 623 (=11817); C35 444 (=12261). That’s very high utility and still a lot of capacity left. I should agree immediately unless I can ask to add more items to increase my utility before agreeing, but I cannot modify their proposal; I can counter-propose with additions up to limit. Since there is 9475-7018=2457 effort slack, I can propose adding high-importance remaining items: B00 (583,568), B94 (783,876), A66 (822,843), A84 (500,854), A58 (457,843), A23 (262,991), B75 (235,947), B21 (138,944), B45 (461,432), C92 (215,686), C24 (273,748), C65 (121,281), C06 (30,133). Pick best by my importance: C70 already included. Next high: B94 783/876, A66 822/843, C92 215 not great, B45 461/432 good, B00 583/568 good, C65 121 low, C06 30 low, B75 235 low, B21 138 low, A23 262 meh. Also A84 500/854 moderate, A58 457/843 moderate. We have 2457 capacity. Try to add A66(843) + B94(876) + B00(568) + B45(432) total effort 2719 >2457. Try choose A66 843 + B94 876 + B45 432 = 2151, leaves 306; can also add C06 133 (effort 133) -> 2284, leaves 173; maybe C65 281 cannot fit; B12 already included. B21 944 too big; B00 568 too big for remaining 173. Could add C06 only. Importance gain: 822+783+461+30=2096. New total effort 7018+2284=9302 under limit. That’s great. Alternatively, swap C35 444/465 for something better? But we can just propose an augmented set. If they refuse, we can accept their original later. So propose adding A66, B94, B45, C06.
