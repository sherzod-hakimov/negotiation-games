But we must keep under 9322. Let's build until near limit maximizing importance. Use high importance big ones too: A87(1058), B81(992), B37(988), B23(959), C83(926), C51(867), A75(864), A96(862), C60(755), A97(775), B16(758), B19(751), A88(717), B64(715), C79(694), C51 already included; B34(917). Compute set with a mix and then add efficient fillers. Try core: A87(962), B81(896), B37(892), B23(863), B34(821), C83(830), C51(771) effort=962+896+892+863+821+830+771=6035. Importance sum high. Remaining budget 9322-6035=3287. Add A96(766)->4053 left 2521; A75(768)->4821 left 146? wait 3287-766=2521; 2521-768=1753. Add A97(679)->1074 left; add C60(659)->415 left; add A88(621) too big; B16(662) too big; C79(598) too big; C10(562) too big; A39(568) too big; B64(619) too big; B19(655) too big. Use small fillers: choose from efficient small items: A71(12), C17(89), A94(118), B15(115), B43(226), A25(283), C53(300), B96(319), B69(326), A65(351), C84(440), B95(448), C72(504), C82(502), A46(514), A28(526), A39 too big previously. We have 415 left: we can add combos: try C84(440) too big; B95(448) too big; C53(300) + A94(118)=418 too big; C53(300)+B15(115)=415 perfect. So add C53 and B15. Then remaining 0. Also we can add tiny ones A71(12) but no room. Total set: core plus A96, A75, A97, C60, C53, B15. Let's compute effort: core 6035 + 766 + 768 + 679 + 659 + 300 + 115 = 103? sum additions: 766+768=1534; +679=2213; +659=2872; +300=3172; +115=3287 which matches remaining. Total = 9322 exactly. Good. This seems excellent for my importance too. I will propose this exact-limit set. Argue that it fits and preserves many of their kept items (they had many of these). Offer flexibility on swapping within effort.'}\n\nREFUSE: {'A71', 'C17', 'A94', 'B15', 'B43', 'A25', 'C53', 'A39', 'C10', 'C79', 'A88', 'C60', 'B16', 'A97', 'A96', 'A75', 'C51', 'C83', 'B34', 'B23', 'B37', 'B81', 'A87'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'Your proposal still exceeds the shared effort limit of 9322.

Compute effort of their set: A87 962 + B81 896 + B37 892 + B23 863 + B34 821 + C83 830 + C51 771 + A96 766 + A75 768 + A97 679 + C60 659 + C53 300 + B15 115 = 9022? Let’s sum carefully: 962+896=1858; +892=2750; +863=3613; +821=4434; +830=5264; +771=6035; +766=6801; +768=7569; +679=8248; +659=8907; +300=9207; +115=9322. Yes, exactly 9322, so it’s feasible. Evaluate my importance for this set: all are among my top-valued items; check if any missing high-importance low/medium effort items could replace with better value: Candidates not included from my top list: C10 658 (eff 562), C79 694 (598), A39 664 (568), A88 717 (621), B16 758 (662), C51 already in, C83 in, B64 715 (619), C72 600 (504), C82 598 (502), A46 610 (514), A28 622 (526), A71 108 (12), C17 185 (89), A94 214 (118), B43 322 (226), A25 379 (283). However, the current set exactly uses the limit with only high-importance items. Any swap would require removing something to add small fillers; but my current set already includes my very top items (A87, B81, B37, B23, B34, C83, C51) plus A96, A75, A97, C60, which are all high to me. The lowest-importance item in their set is B15 (211) and C53 (396), but they are tiny efforts used to hit the limit. If I could replace B15 (115) + C53 (300) = 415 effort with one better single item around 415 effort with higher importance: e.g., C84 effort 440 importance 536 (too big by +25), C82 502 (too big), C72 504 (too big), A28 526 (too big), A46 514, A39 568 (all too big). Under 415 effort candidates: B96 319 (importance 415) + B15 115 = 434 (still need to drop someone else to fit), but we only can swap equal effort. Single item under 415: A25 283 (379 importance) could replace C53 (300, 396) or B15 (115, 211) but we must keep within limit; swapping C53->A25 reduces effort by 17, giving slack 17, which we can’t fill. Could do C53 (300) + B15 (115) -> A39 (568) is 415 -> 568 need +153 effort we don't have. Alternatively C53->C10 (562) would need +262 effort, impossible. So their exact-fit set is strong for me; accepting secures high total importance.
