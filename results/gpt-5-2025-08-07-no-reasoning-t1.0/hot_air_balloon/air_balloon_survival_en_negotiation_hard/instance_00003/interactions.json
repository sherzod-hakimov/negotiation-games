Try to propose a strong but feasible set. Let me try greedy by ratio: include A87(4), C00(116)->120, C54(209)->329, A71(505)->834, B32(285)->1119, C01(571)->1690, B41(586)->2276, B35(664)->2940, B86(651)->3591 within 3681 leaves 90; cannot add anything else except maybe none.

Could we swap B86 (651, 668) for A10 (740, 808) but effort would exceed limit if added; replace B86 with A10 increases effort by 89 to 3680 (since 3591 -651 +740 = 3680) still within limit; importance would be 5957 -668 +808 = 6097, better. New set: {A87,C00,C54,A71,B32,C01,B41,B35,A10} efforts: 4+116+209+505+285+571+586+664+740=3680 <=3681. Check if any upgrade possible: remaining capacity 1; cannot add. Could we replace something: B86 removed already. Items excluded: A03 262/387 low, A04 low, B33 low, A77 very low, C17 low. This seems near-optimal given my values. I’ll propose this strong set.

I should see if we can include higher-value items like A77, A04, C17, A03, B33 by swapping out low-importance-to-me items (A71, A10, C00, B35). Try to construct a counterproposal near limit maximizing my value. Consider must-haves by my value density: A87 (668/4 insane), A04 (822/392), A03 (783/387), C17 (808/700), B33 (780/613), A77 (868/940), B32 (583/285), C54 (508/209), B41 (484/586), B86 (461/651), C01 (389/571). Use knapsack intuition. Start building: Include A87(4), A04(392), A03(387), B33(613), B32(285), C54(209), C17(700) subtotal effort 4+392+387+613+285+209+700=2590, value 668+822+783+780+583+508+808=4952. Remaining capacity 3681-2590=1091. Add A77(940) value +868 -> effort 3530 remain 151. Add C00(116) value +121 -> effort 3646 remain 35. Can we add anything else ≤35? No. Total value 4952+868+121=5941 effort 3646. Great. This set: {A87, A04, A03, B33, B32, C54, C17, A77, C00}. Check if any swap to improve: remaining 35 wasted. What about replacing C00(116,121) with something else: items with effort ≤151 not used: none besides C00 and A87 already used. Could swap B41(586,484) by removing something: we are under cap by 35; to add B41(586) need free 551; would need to drop maybe C00(116)+ something like? Not efficient versus current high-value picks. What about adding B41 instead of A77: If we drop A77(940,868) we free 940 to add B41(586,484) and have remaining 940+151=1091 (actually we had 1091 before adding A77). With 1091 we could add B41(586) and maybe C01(571) exceeds (586+571=1157 >1091). Maybe B41(586) + C00(116) + A71(505) would be 1207>1091. B41(586) + C00(116) + B35(664) is 1366>1091. B41(586)+A71(505)=1091 exactly! Value 484+65=549, which is much worse than A77(868). What about B86(651,461) + C00(116,121) =767 fits in 1091 plus maybe A71(505) would exceed. 461+121=582 < 868 still worse. C01(571,389)+C00(116,121)=510 value worse than 868. So A77 is best use. What about including A10(740,138) somewhere? Not good. So my counterproposal is strong for me. Now craft message: REFUSE their proposal and propose my set. Provide argument: maintains limit (3646 ≤ 3681), swaps out lower-yield items (A71, A10, B35, B41, C01) for higher-impact set, includes several broadly useful low-effort picks (A87, C54, B32) and adds A77, A04, A03, C17, B33.

My utility would plummet. I should firmly refuse and counter with a package that restores my core picks while offering some concessions. Keep the super-efficient core A87, C00, C54, B32. I’ll try to reintroduce A71 and C01 (both high value to me) and at least one of B41/B35/A10. To invite agreement, I can include one of their requested items with modest harm (A03 is less terrible than A04, B33, A77, C17 for me). Build counter near the limit: Start from my previous optimal set {A87,C00,C54,A71,B32,C01,B41,B35,A10} (effort 3680). To concede one of theirs, replace the weakest to me among those: by my values, B41 (583/586) or B35 (783/664) or A10 (808/740). A03 has effort 387. If I add A03, I must drop something of at least 387 effort. Dropping B41 yields effort 3680 - 586 + 387 = 3481; we could potentially add another small item they like, e.g., C17 (700) too large; A04 (392) could also fit if we drop more; but we’d have capacity 200 after adding A03, not enough for others. What if I drop B41 and keep the rest: new set {A87,C00,C54,A71,B32,C01,B35,A10,A03} effort 3481 and value decreases by 583 then increase by 262 -> net -321 utility; still acceptable as concession if it helps agreement. I might try to also propose swapping B35 for B86 (they didn’t ask B86; but it’s similar effort 651 vs 664) not needed. Better to include one concession A03 and keep the rest key items. Alternatively, if they resist A10, I could swap A10 for B41 to keep their concerns, but they removed both; unclear preferences. I’ll counter with set including A03, exclude B41. Argue that this keeps efficient core and adds one of their requested items, open to swapping among B35/A10/B41 if they have a priority among their list, and explicitly state willingness to consider A04 if we drop B41 and possibly adjust.

My importance: 668+121+508+65+583+389+262+138+783 = 3517. This is much worse than my last proposal (5941). I should counter by keeping A03 and pushing for my top missing items A04, C17, B33, A77 while dropping low-value-to-me items A71, A10, B35, C01. Try to construct a near-cap counter that might be acceptable if I make a modest concession they like (they seem to value A71/C01/B35/A10). Keep A03 (they accepted), keep shared efficient A87, C54, B32, C00. Add A04, C17, B33, A77 as before. That is my previous set with A03 included; already had A03 included. Perhaps offer an alternative that swaps out the heaviest A77 (940) for something they like from their core to show flexibility. Build two options: Option 1 (my max-value): {A87, C00, C54, B32, A04, A03, C17, B33, A77} effort 3646, value 5941. Option 2 (concession): replace A77(940,868) with one of their core items: C01(571,389) + A71(505,65) together 1076 > 940, too big. Try C01(571) alone: new effort 3646-940+571=3277, value 5941-868+389=5462. Could also add something else with remaining capacity 3681-3277=404; candidates: A04 already included, A03 included, C54 included, B32 included, C00 included. Remaining items with effort ≤404: A04(392) already in; A03(387) already in; C54(209) in; C00(116) in; A71(505) no; B32(285) in. Maybe add B41(586) no; B35(664) no; A10(740) no; C17 in; B33 in; A77 removed. Nothing new to add; capacity unused. Option 2 value 5462 still far above their set (3517) and maybe more palatable since it includes C01 which they kept insisting on. Alternatively include A10 (740) instead of A77? Effort 3646-940+740=3446, value 5941-868+138=5211, worse than with C01. Include B35 (664): effort 3370, value 5337. Include A71 (505): effort 3211, value 5138. Best concession among their favs is C01. I’ll counter with Option 2 to show compromise while still very strong for me.
