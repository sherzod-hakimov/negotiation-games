          "thinking": "Let me analyze this proposal. First I need to calculate the total effort and check if it's within the limit.\n\nThe proposed items are: {'A71', 'C17', 'B15', 'A94', 'B43', 'A87', 'B37', 'B81', 'B23', 'C83', 'B34', 'A39', 'A28', 'B64', 'C79', 'B16', 'A97', 'C51', 'B19', 'C60', 'A75', 'A88', 'A96', 'A46', 'C72', 'C82', 'B69', 'A65', 'A08', 'C84', 'B96', 'C53', 'A25'}\n\nLet me calculate the total effort:\nA71: 12, C17: 89, B15: 115, A94: 118, B43: 226, A87: 962, B37: 892, B81: 896, B23: 863, C83: 830, B34: 821, A39: 568, A28: 526, B64: 619, C79: 598, B16: 662, A97: 679, C51: 771, B19: 655, C60: 659, A75: 768, A88: 621, A96: 766, A46: 514, C72: 504, C82: 502, B69: 326, A65: 351, A08: 380, C84: 440, B96: 319, C53: 300, A25: 283\n\nTotal effort = 12 + 89 + 115 + 118 + 226 + 962 + 892 + 896 + 863 + 830 + 821 + 568 + 526 + 619 + 598 + 662 + 679 + 771 + 655 + 659 + 768 + 621 + 766 + 514 + 504 + 502 + 326 + 351 + 380 + 440 + 319 + 300 + 283 = 17,516\n \nI've discovered a significant problem. The total effort far exceeds the specified limit of 9,322. I'll systematically investigate the discrepancy by examining the missing items and verifying the calculation.\n\nTwo items are excluded from the proposal: B95 and C10, with a combined effort of 1,010. I'll carefully add up the remaining effort values to confirm the total.\n\nAfter calculating, the proposed effort comes to 17,056, which still exceeds the expected limit. I'm skeptical of the opponent's calculations and want to verify the numbers.\n\nI'll now track my personal importance for the proposal, noting that B95 and C10 would result in a loss of 1,202 importance points. I'm partway through summing my importance values for the remaining items.\n\nContinuing the calculation, I add up the remaining importance values: 476 + 544 + 664 + 447 + 992 + 917 + 622 + 598 + 422 + 1058 + 715 + 211 + 694 + 758 + 396 + 926 + 658 + 775 + 379 + 536 + 108 + 959 + 415 + 867 + 185 + 751 + 600 + 214 + 610 + 322 + 988 + 717 + 862 + 755 + 864 = 20,032.\n\nThe proposal's total importance reaches 20,032, but it's clearly beyond the acceptable effort limit. I'll need to develop an alternative approach that meets the constraints.",

The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values.

The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."
