          "thinking": "Let me analyze this situation step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what I need to do:\n1. I need to negotiate with another participant to select a set of items\n2. The total effort of selected items must not exceed 8770\n3. I want to maximize my own importance values\n4. I don't know the other participant's importance values\n5. I need to use the structured formats for communication\n\nLet me calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to identify the most valuable items for me:\n\nItem ratios (importance/effort):\n- B21: 138/830 = 0.166\n- B00: 583/638 = 0.914\n- A08: 868/607 = 1.430\n- A27: 822/106 = 7.755\n- B94: 783/630 = 1.243\n- B53: 65/382 = 0.170\n- A23: 262/773 = 0.339\n- C65: 121/455 = 0.266\n- A89: 508/262 = 1.939\n- B67: 780/634 = 1.230\n- B45: 461/60 = 7.683\n- C34: 484/54 = 8.963\n- C12: 668/849 = 0.787\n- A05: 389/801 = 0.486\n- B60: 808/324 = 2.494\n- C92: 215/164 = 1.311\n- B69: 97/832 = 0.117\n- A84: 500/136 = 3.676\n- C06: 30/980 = 0.031\n- B12: 915/946 = 0.967\n- A16: 856/645 = 1.327\n- B85: 400/842 = 0.475\n\n\n- C35: 444/106 = 4.189\n- B10: 623/116 = 5.371\n- C15: 781/875 = 0.893\n- B09: 786/446 = 1.762\n- B16: 3/649 = 0.005\n- C81: 713/601 = 1.186\n- A58: 457/252 = 1.815\n- C24: 273/763 = 0.358\n- A30: 739/213 = 3.469\n- A66: 822/517 = 1.590\n\nI'll focus on items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios. The top performers include C34 (8.963), A27 (7.755), B45 (7.683), and B10 (5.371). These items provide the most value relative to their effort requirements. I'll prioritize these when considering my selection strategy.\n\nBy combining the top items, I've allocated 816 effort points, leaving 7,954 effort remaining for additional selections. This suggests I have significant room to incorporate more high-value items into my overall approach.\n\nI'll strategically add the next set of high-ratio items, which increases my total effort allocation to 2,617. This brings my remaining effort capacity down to 6,153, indicating continued flexibility in item selection.\n\nThe next potential additions include items with lower but still compelling ratios, such as B46 and A08. These options provide opportunities to maximize importance while carefully managing effort expenditure. By methodically evaluating each item's ratio and potential contribution, I can optimize my overall strategy.\n\nIncorporating A16, C92, and B94 pushes my total effort to 5,070, leaving 3,700 in reserve. This systematic approach allows me to build a robust selection of high-value items while maintaining strategic flexibility.",

The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values.

I'll need to investigate further.\n\nI'll examine potential improvements using the remaining 544 effort capacity.
