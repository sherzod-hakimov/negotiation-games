With 2641 effort used, we have 745 effort remaining. I can try to get them to add A04 (203 effort, 484 importance to me) and C54 (369 effort, 668 importance to me) which would bring the total to 3213 effort - still under the limit. This would boost my total importance to 2459, which while not optimal, might be an acceptable compromise if they refuse to budge further.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt REFUSE: {'A87', 'B86', 'B33', 'A71', 'B32', 'C17', 'C00'}\\ \tt \\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A87', 'B86', 'B33', 'A71', 'B32', 'C17', 'C00', 'A04', 'C54'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'Your proposal shows good collaborative instincts and I want to build on that foundation.

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Their proposal gives me 3393 total importance (A87:461, B86:121, B33:668, A71:583, B32:508, C17:484, C00:400, A04:138, C54:30), which is excellent! They included my top 5 highest-value items (B33, A71, B32, C17, A87) which account for most of my value. Only the bottom 3 items (B86, A04, C54) are low-value for me, totaling just 289. The effort is 3213, within the limit. This is a very good deal - I get 3393 out of my maximum possible importance.

This selection captures the most valuable items from both our perspectives while making efficient use of our effort budget at 3213 out of 3386.
