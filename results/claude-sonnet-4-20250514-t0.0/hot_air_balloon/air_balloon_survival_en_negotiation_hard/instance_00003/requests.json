A87: 115.25 (importance 461, effort 4) - MUST INCLUDE\n2. C00: 7.086 (importance 822, effort 116) - HIGH PRIORITY\n3. C54: 2.431 (importance 508, effort 209) - HIGH PRIORITY\n4. A71: 1.719 (importance 868, effort 505) - HIGH PRIORITY\n5. B32: 1.698 (importance 484, effort 285) - HIGH PRIORITY\n\n\n6. C01: 1.366 (importance 780, effort 571) - GOOD\n7.

B41: 0.995 (importance 583, effort 586) - OKAY\n\nI'll strategically select top-performing items to maximize total importance. The most efficient items offer the best value with minimal effort. I'll start by selecting the absolute top performers, prioritizing those with the highest importance-to-effort ratio.\n\nMy initial selection includes the standout items:\n- A87: extremely high efficiency (115.25)\n- C00: exceptional value (7.086 efficiency)\n- C54: strong performance (2.431 efficiency)\n\nThese choices provide maximum importance while consuming minimal effort, setting a solid foundation for my optimization strategy.\n\nI'll continue by adding high-value items like A71, B32, and C01, carefully tracking total effort and importance. The goal is to maximize the set's overall value without exceeding the 3681 effort limit.\n\nAfter careful selection, I've identified a near-optimal set: A87, C00, C54, A71, B32, C01, B35, A10, and B41. This combination maximizes importance while staying within the effort constraints, achieving a remarkable balance of efficiency and performance.\n\nThe total effort comes to 3680, just under the maximum allowable limit. The total importance reaches an impressive 6097, representing a strategic selection of items that provide significant value.\n\nI'll verify each item's contribution, confirming their individual and collective impact on the overall optimization strategy.",

Let me double-check:\n4 + 116 = 120\n120 + 209 = 329\n329 + 505 = 834\n834 + 285 = 1119\n1119 + 571 = 1690\n1690 + 664 = 2354\n2354 + 740 = 3094\n3094 + 651 = 3745\n\nYes, this is 3745, which exceeds the limit of 3681 by 64.

Then I should make a counter-proposal that maximizes my importance while staying within the limit.\n\n\nI'll prioritize high-value items with low effort, focusing on maximizing my total importance. Some standout candidates catch my eye immediately. A87 is particularly attractive with its extremely low effort of 4 and high importance of 668. A04 and A03 also look promising, offering significant importance with relatively modest effort requirements. I'll need to carefully select items that balance high value against the strict effort constraint, potentially creating a strategic combination that optimizes my overall gain.\n\nMy initial selection includes top performers like A77, A04, C17, A03, B33, A87, and B32. These items collectively represent an impressive importance score of 5312, achieved through an effort investment of 3321. I notice I still have 360 effort remaining, which suggests I might be able to incorporate additional items strategically.\n\nSpecifically, I'm considering whether C54 could fit into my remaining effort budget, as its 508 importance seems compelling against its 209 effort requirement.\n\nAfter adding C54, my total effort rises to 3530, with an importance boost to 5820. I then realize C00, with its modest 116 effort and 121 importance, could potentially complete my selection without exceeding constraints.\n\nMy final optimized set becomes {'A77', 'A04', 'C17', 'A03', 'B33', 'A87', 'B32', 'C54', 'C00'}, precisely balancing 3646 effort against my 3681 limit while maximizing overall importance.\n\nThe cumulative importance reaches 5941, confirming an efficient allocation strategy.",

Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3681\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 700, \"B41\": 586, \"A71\": 505, \"C00\": 116, \"B35\": 664, \"A77\": 940, \"A03\": 387, \"A04\": 392, \"C54\": 209, \"C01\": 571, \"A87\": 4, \"B32\": 285, \"B86\": 651, \"B33\": 613, \"A10\": 740}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"A71\": 65, \"C00\": 121, \"A10\": 138, \"B35\": 262, \"C01\": 389, \"B86\": 461, \"B41\": 484, \"C54\": 508, \"B32\": 583, \"A87\": 668, \"B33\": 780, \"A03\": 783, \"C17\": 808, \"A04\": 822, \"A77\": 868}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3681\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 700, \"B41\": 586, \"A71\": 505, \"C00\": 116, \"B35\": 664, \"A77\": 940, \"A03\": 387, \"A04\": 392, \"C54\": 209, \"C01\": 571, \"A87\": 4, \"B32\": 285, \"B86\": 651, \"B33\": 613, \"A10\": 740}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

However, they seem to be stuck on B33. Given that we've been negotiating back and forth and this is a reasonable proposal that gives me 3827 importance (which is quite good), I should consider whether to accept or try one more time. \n\nTheir argument about \"strategic positioning\" and \"long-term benefits\" suggests they might value B33 highly.
