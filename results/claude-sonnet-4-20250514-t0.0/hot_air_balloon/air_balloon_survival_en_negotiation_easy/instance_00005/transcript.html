        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I need to analyze the efficiency of each item (importance/effort ratio) to maximize my benefit. Looking at my values: C61 has the highest efficiency at 5.613 (668/119), followed by C55 at 4.94 (583/118), and C42 at 4.698 (808/172). I should prioritize these high-efficiency items. Building an optimal set: C61, C55, C42, A18, B19, C10, B36, A43, C67 gives me total effort of 3109 (under limit) and importance of 5303.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Let me analyze the opponent\&#x27;s proposal. They selected items with total effort 3109, well within our limit. For me, this gives total importance of 5303. Looking at my importance/effort ratios, the best items are C61 (5.61), C55 (4.94), C42 (4.70), and A18 (2.92). The opponent\&#x27;s proposal includes most of these high-efficiency items, which is promising. However, I notice they didn\&#x27;t include A62, which has a decent ratio of 1.58 and very low effort (41). I can potentially add A62 to their proposal since we have 61 effort units remaining, which would increase my total importance by 65 points.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your proposal includes many valuable items and stays well within our budget. I appreciate the efficient selection of high-value items.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent has built on my proposal by adding A62, which costs only 41 effort units. From my perspective, A62 has low importance (65) and low efficiency (1.59), making it one of my least valuable items. However, the opponent seems to value it enough to include it, and since it has minimal effort cost and we stay well under budget (3150 vs 3170 limit), this could be acceptable. The opponent is being collaborative by building on my proposal rather than completely changing it, which suggests good faith negotiation. I should consider if this trade-off is worth accepting or if I can push for something better.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I can see the logic in adding A62 since it uses minimal effort and we have budget remaining. While A62 may not be the most impactful item, your willingness to build on my original proposal shows good collaborative spirit. The total effort of 3150 keeps us safely within our limit while maximizing our item count.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;C55&#x27;, &#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;A18&#x27;, &#x27;B19&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;, &#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;C67&#x27;, &#x27;A62&#x27;}</p>
