Let me calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to identify the most efficient items for me:\n\nItem ratios (importance/effort):\n- C08: 138/948 = 0.146\n- C55: 583/118 = 4.941\n- A43: 868/469 = 1.851\n- A67: 822/919 = 0.894\n- B42: 783/284 = 2.757\n- A62: 65/111 = 0.586\n- B19: 262/806 = 0.325\n- C43: 121/47 = 2.574\n- C73: 508/848 = 0.599\n- C10: 780/303 = 2.574\n- B36: 461/13 = 35.462\n- A18: 484/629 = 0.769\n- C61: 668/687 = 0.972\n- C67: 389/15 = 25.933\n- C42: 808/94 = 8.596\n\nRanking by efficiency (importance/effort ratio):\n1. B36: 35.462 (461 importance, 13 effort)\n2. C67: 25.933 (389 importance, 15 effort)\n3. C42: 8.596 (808 importance, 94 effort)\n4. C55: 4.941 (583 importance, 118 effort)\n5. B42: 2.757 (783 importance, 284 effort)\n6. C43: 2.574 (121 importance, 47 effort)\n7. C10: 2.574 (780 importance, 303 effort)\n\n\n8. A43: 1.851 (868 importance, 469 effort)\n9.

A62: 0.586 (65 importance, 111 effort)\n14. B19: 0.325 (262 importance, 806 effort)\n\nContinuing my ranking reveals less efficient items with lower importance-to-effort ratios. I'll focus on top-performing options to maximize overall impact while managing resource constraints.\n\nI've already selected several high-value items, accumulating 1343 effort across multiple candidates. My strategy involves carefully balancing importance against resource expenditure, leaving 1802 effort available for potential additional selections.\n\nThe next potential candidate requires careful evaluation to determine its strategic fit within my remaining capacity.\n\nBy incorporating C61 and A67, I've expanded the set to 2949 effort, which still falls under the 3145 limit. This brings the total importance to 6283, demonstrating a methodical approach to maximizing value.\n\nWith just 196 effort remaining, I systematically assess potential additions, quickly eliminating options that exceed my remaining budget. A62 emerges as the optimal final selection, fitting precisely within my constraints and bringing the total effort to 3060.\n\nAfter adding A62's 65 importance, my set reaches 6348 total importance. Despite having 85 effort left, no remaining items can be efficiently integrated. The final set of 11 items represents a carefully curated selection balancing effort and importance.",
