C42 stands out with an exceptional 6.91 ratio, followed by A67 at 3.75 and B42 at 2.85. These items provide the most value relative to their effort requirements. I'll prioritize these high-performing items in my negotiation strategy to maximize overall importance while staying within the 3358 effort limit.\n\nAfter selecting the initial high-ratio items, I've calculated the cumulative effort at 1772, with a total importance of 4410. I still have 1586 effort remaining, which allows me to consider additional items. A18, C67, and C73 all fit within the remaining budget, each offering a reasonable importance-to-effort trade-off. I'll carefully evaluate each to optimize my final selection.\n\nThe final set includes 10 items, balancing effort and importance strategically. By meticulously tracking available resources and selecting items that maximize value, I've constructed a proposal with 3188 total effort and 5927 total importance. This approach ensures I'm making the most efficient use of the available resources while maintaining a high-impact selection.",

Let me see if I can do better by proposing something else. I need to look at items with high importance/effort ratios.\n\nLet me calculate importance/effort ratios for all items:\nC08: 138/171 = 0.807\nC55: 583/933 = 0.625\nA43: 868/552 = 1.573\nA67: 822/219 = 3.753\nB42: 783/275 = 2.847\nA62: 65/778 = 0.084\n\n\nB19: 262/341 = 0.768\nC43: 121/615 = 0.197\nC73: 508/519 = 0.979\nC10: 780/862 = 0.905\nB36: 461/262 = 1.760\nA18: 484/377 = 1.284\nC61: 668/347 = 1.925\nC67: 389/349 = 1.115\nC42: 808/117 = 6.906\n\nI've discovered some standout items with exceptional value. C42 emerges as the top performer with an impressive 6.906 ratio, followed by A67 at 3.753. These items provide maximum impact relative to their effort, making them prime candidates for selection.\n\nThe opponent's proposal looks promising, with high-ratio items like C61 at 1.925 and B36 at 1.760. I'm intrigued by the potential to optimize this selection further. The total importance of 5929 suggests significant value, but I want to explore whether I can refine the combination to maximize efficiency.\n\nMy strategy involves carefully examining each item, potentially removing lower-performing entries and introducing more impactful alternatives. I'll methodically analyze the proposal to determine if it represents the optimal solution or if room for improvement exists.",
