          "thinking": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I have:\n- Effort limit: 3357\n- Item efforts: {\"A21\": 506, \"B93\": 492, \"A11\": 338, \"B33\": 122, \"C08\": 131, \"B39\": 909, \"B96\": 144, \"C85\": 716, \"A82\": 263, \"B31\": 231, \"B20\": 91, \"A60\": 651, \"B09\": 552, \"C81\": 849, \"B21\": 720}\n- My importance values: {\"A21\": 138, \"B93\": 583, \"A11\": 868, \"B33\": 822, \"C08\": 783, \"B39\": 65, \"B96\": 262, \"C85\": 121, \"A82\": 508, \"B31\": 780, \"B20\": 461, \"A60\": 484, \"B09\": 668, \"C81\": 389, \"B21\": 808}\n\nI need to find the best combination that maximizes my importance while staying under the effort limit of 3357.\n\nLet me calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to help guide my decisions:\n- A21: 138/506 = 0.273\n- B93: 583/492 = 1.185\n- A11: 868/338 = 2.568\n- B33: 822/122 = 6.738\n- C08: 783/131 = 5.977\n- B39: 65/909 = 0.072\n- B96: 262/144 = 1.819\n- C85: 121/716 = 0.169\n- A82: 508/263 = 1.931\n- B31: 780/231 = 3.377\n\n\n- B20: 461/91 = 5.066\n- A60: 484/651 = 0.743\n- B09: 668/552 = 1.210\n- C81: 389/849 = 0.458\n- B21: 808/720 = 1.122\n\nI've identified the top performers based on their importance-to-effort efficiency. The standout items are B33, C08, and B20, which offer the most value for the least effort. These three items have ratios above 5, indicating they provide exceptional importance relative to their resource requirements. I'll prioritize these items as I develop my selection strategy.\n\nCombining these top items yields an initial set with 913 total effort and 3714 total importance. This provides a strong foundation, but I still have 2444 effort capacity remaining. I'll explore additional high-ratio candidates to maximize my overall efficiency.\n\nI'm now considering A82 and B96 as potential additions, which have ratios of 1.931 and 1.819 respectively. These items offer more moderate value but could help fill out the remaining effort allocation.\n\nContinuing the selection process, I systematically add B09, B93, and B21, carefully tracking cumulative effort and importance. By incrementally incorporating these items, I build a comprehensive set that approaches but does not exceed the 3357 effort limit. With 3084 total effort, I have 273 effort remaining, leaving room for potentially one more strategic item like A60 or A21.\n\nAfter methodically ruling out A60, A21, C81, and C85 due to exceeding remaining capacity, I settle on a robust proposal: {'B33', 'C08', 'B20', 'B31', 'A11', 'A82', 'B96', 'B09', 'B93', 'B21'}. A precise verification confirms the effort precisely matches 3084, validating the selection's feasibility.\n\nThe resulting combination yields an impressive importance score of 6543, representing a promising initial strategy for maximizing value within defined constraints.",

Let me see if I can do better by proposing a different set.\n\nLooking at my highest importance items:\n- B39: 868 (effort 909)\n- C85: 822 (effort 716)\n- A21: 808 (effort 506)\n- B96: 783 (effort 144) - already in their proposal\n- C81: 780 (effort 849)\n- B20: 668 (effort 91) - already in their proposal\n\n\n- A60: 583 (effort 651)\n- A82: 508 (effort 263) - already in their proposal\n\nI'm strategizing to optimize my selection. I'll focus on items with the best importance-to-effort ratio, carefully balancing the total effort against the potential importance gained. Some key items are already in the current proposal, which limits my options for significant improvement.\n\nMy initial selection includes high-value items like B39, C85, A21, B96, and B20. These provide substantial importance while keeping the total effort manageable. By selecting these specific items, I've created a set with 3949 importance points using only 2366 effort.\n\nWith 991 effort remaining, I identify an opportunity to add C81. This additional item increases my total importance to 4729 while keeping the effort under the 3357 limit. The strategic selection maximizes potential impact within the given constraints.\n\nWhen attempting to add A60 and A82, I discover these would exceed the effort threshold. As an alternative approach, I explore replacing C81 with A82, which adjusts the item mix while maintaining a strong importance-to-effort ratio. This new configuration yields 4457 importance points using 2629 effort, leaving 728 effort available for potential future optimization.\n\nBy incorporating A60, the total importance rises to 5040, significantly improving upon the previous strategy and demonstrating a more strategic selection of items.",

Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3357\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"A21\": 506, \"B93\": 492, \"A11\": 338, \"B33\": 122, \"C08\": 131, \"B39\": 909, \"B96\": 144, \"C85\": 716, \"A82\": 263, \"B31\": 231, \"B20\": 91, \"A60\": 651, \"B09\": 552, \"C81\": 849, \"B21\": 720}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"A21\": 138, \"B93\": 583, \"A11\": 868, \"B33\": 822, \"C08\": 783, \"B39\": 65, \"B96\": 262, \"C85\": 121, \"A82\": 508, \"B31\": 780, \"B20\": 461, \"A60\": 484, \"B09\": 668, \"C81\": 389, \"B21\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\n"
