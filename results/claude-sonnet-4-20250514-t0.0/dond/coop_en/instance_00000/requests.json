I said I was interested in the rings and would be happy to let them have the dice and pan. They seemed to agree to this arrangement where I would take all 3 rings and they would take the dice and pan.\n\nSince they've already submitted their secret proposal, I need to submit mine now. Based on our conversation, I should propose taking the 3 rings, which would leave them with the dice and pan (which is what they said they wanted).\n\nMy value function is: ring: 3, dice: 1, pan: 0\nSo 3 rings would give me 3 × 3 = 9 points.\n\nThe format should be: [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]",
