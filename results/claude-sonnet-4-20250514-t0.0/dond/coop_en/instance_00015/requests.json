The other player seems very interested in the statues and said they could use the nail too\n4. I really want the hammer (worth 9 to me)\n5. We discussed that they would take the 3 statues + 1 nail, and I would take the 1 hammer\n\nThis seems like a good deal since:\n- I get the hammer (9 points for me)\n- They get the statues (which they said they value highly) + the nail\n- The nail is only worth 1 point to me, so giving it to them is fine\n\nMy proposal should be: 1 hammer (since that's what we agreed on and it maximizes my value)",
