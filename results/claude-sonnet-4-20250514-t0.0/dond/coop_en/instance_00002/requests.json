Or we could split them 1-1, giving me 8 points total.\n\nBut I need to remember the goal is to maximize the TOTAL score for both of us combined.

I really appreciate that you're thinking about how our different preferences can create a win-win situation.\n\nYou're absolutely right - since you're very interested in the mirrors and I don't value them at all, you taking both mirrors makes perfect sense. And since the phone is my top priority, me getting that works great too.\n\nFor the 2 fruits, since you mentioned they're your lowest priority, would you be okay if I took both of them? That way you get the items you value most (the mirrors) and I get the items I value most (phone + fruits). \n\nOr if you'd prefer, we could each take 1 fruit. What would work better for you?"

          "thinking": "The other player has submitted their secret proposal. Based on our conversation, they said they were very interested in the mirrors and that the phone was valuable to them too, but they prioritized mirrors. They said fruits were their lowest priority.\n\nWe discussed a framework where I would get the phone (which I value at 6 points) and they would get the mirrors (which I value at 0 points each, so 0 total for both mirrors). \n\nFor the fruits, I asked if I could take both since they said fruits were their lowest priority. Each fruit gives me 2 points, so 2 fruits would give me 4 points.\n\nSo my optimal proposal based on our discussion would be:\n- 1 phone (6 points for me)  \n- 2 fruits (4 points for me)\n- 0 mirrors (0 points for me)\n\nTotal for me: 10 points\n\nThis leaves for them:\n- 0 phones\n- 2 mirrors  \n- 0 fruits\n\nSince they said mirrors were very valuable to them and fruits were lowest priority, this seems like it should work well for them too, assuming their values align with what they said.",
