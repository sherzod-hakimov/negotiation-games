Since you mentioned the pictures aren't very valuable to you, how about this alternative: I take the orange and 2 pictures, and you get the pepper and 1 picture? Or if you really prefer both the orange and pepper, what would you be willing to offer in addition to the pictures to make it worth my while?"

I need to submit mine now.\n\nLet me think about what would be optimal for me:\n- Orange: value 7\n- Pepper: value 3  \n- Picture: value 0\n\nSo I want to maximize my score. The orange is by far the most valuable to me (7 points), then the pepper (3 points), and pictures are worthless to me (0 points each).\n\nFrom our conversation, the other player seemed interested in the orange too, but they also seemed willing to consider taking pictures. They asked about me taking orange + pepper vs them taking orange + 2 pictures + me getting pepper + 1 picture.\n\nSince I don't know their exact proposal, I should propose what gives me the maximum value. The best case for me would be to get both the orange (7 points) and pepper (3 points) for a total of 10 points, leaving the other player with all 3 pictures.\n\nLet me propose: 1 orange, 1 pepper (and they get the 3 pictures)",
