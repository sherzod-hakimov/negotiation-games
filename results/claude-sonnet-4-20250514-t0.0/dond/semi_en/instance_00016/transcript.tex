	 That sounds like a great arrangement! I'm very interested in the vases, so taking all three of them works perfectly for me. It seems like we both get what we value most - you get the chair and wire that you're particularly interested in, and I get the vases. This feels like a fair split where we both benefit.\\ \tt \\ \tt [Proposal: 3 vases]
