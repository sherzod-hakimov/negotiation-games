        <p>That sounds great! I&#x27;d love to take the shovel and berries. Since you mentioned splitting the glasses and bowl - how about you take all 3 glasses and I take the bowl? The glasses seem more useful as a set anyway. What do you think about that arrangement?</p>

        <p>I think there may have been a misunderstanding - I was saying that I&#x27;m interested in keeping the shovel for myself, not offering it to you. The shovel is quite important to me. How about this instead: I take the shovel and all 3 glasses, and you can have both berries and the bowl? That way we both get items that work well for us.</p>

        <p>Ah, I see the confusion now! You&#x27;re right, you want to keep the shovel. Your proposal of you taking the shovel and 3 glasses while I get the 2 berries and bowl actually works well for me. The bowl is quite useful to me and the berries are a nice bonus. Since you value the shovel highly and I&#x27;m getting good value from the bowl, this seems like a fair split. Shall we go with that arrangement?</p>
