        <p>I&#x27;m interested in making sure we both get items that are valuable to us! I&#x27;m particularly drawn to the chalk and would really like to have that if possible. I&#x27;m also quite interested in the bolts. How do you feel about the crayons? Are those something you&#x27;d be interested in, or do you have other preferences among the items?</p>

        <p>That works out well! I&#x27;m actually not very interested in the crayons at all, so you&#x27;re welcome to those. I do have a strong preference for the bolts though - they would be quite valuable to me. Since you mentioned being drawn to the chalk, what if you took the chalk and all the crayons? That would leave me with the 2 bolts. Would that division work for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great arrangement! You get the bolts which you said are valuable to you, and I get the chalk which I really wanted plus all the crayons. It seems like we both get items we prefer, so this feels like a fair division to me.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 3 crayons, 1 chalk]</p>
