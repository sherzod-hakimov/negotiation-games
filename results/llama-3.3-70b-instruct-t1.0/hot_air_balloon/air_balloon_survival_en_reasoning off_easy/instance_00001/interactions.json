However, I'm concerned that the addition of C73, which has a high effort, might limit our flexibility to make further adjustments. I'd like to explore alternative combinations that could potentially include other high-importance items, such as B11 or A47, which might be more important to me. I'm willing to consider compromises and adjustments to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.'}\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A19', 'B91', 'A30', 'C24', 'A39', 'A56', 'B11'}\nARGUMENT: {'As a revised proposal, I suggest this set, which includes a mix of high-importance items and makes use of the available effort limit. The total effort of this set is 4063, which is still within the LIMIT. I believe this combination better balances the importance and effort, and could be a potential agreement. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this proposal and explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.'}",
