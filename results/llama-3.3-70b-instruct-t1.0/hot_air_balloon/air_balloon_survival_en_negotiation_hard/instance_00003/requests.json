        "response": "STRATEGIC REASONING: {'I will evaluate the new proposal and calculate the total effort of the proposed items. The total effort of the proposed items is 586 + 700 + 505 + 4 = 1795. This is still within the limit of 3681. I notice that this proposal includes many of my high-importance items, such as B41, C17, and A71. The inclusion of A87, which has a very low effort value, is also a good addition. I believe this proposal is a strong candidate for agreement, as it aligns well with my priorities and stays within the effort limit. I will argue in favor of this proposal and see if we can come to an agreement.'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'I am pleased to see that this proposal includes many of the items that are important to me, such as B41, C17, and A71.
