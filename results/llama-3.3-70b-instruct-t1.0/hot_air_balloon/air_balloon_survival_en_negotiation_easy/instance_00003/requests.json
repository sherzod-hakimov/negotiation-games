Since the goal is to maximize total importance while staying within the LIMIT of 3712, I should prioritize items with high importance and relatively low effort. Looking at the effort values, I notice that items like \"A43\" and \"C43\" have relatively low effort, while items like \"C73\" have high effort. Based on my importance values, \"A43\" and \"C55\" seem like strong candidates because \"A43\" has an importance of 868 and an effort of 79, and \"C55\" has an importance of 583 and an effort of 388. My next step is to consider possible proposals that include these items and evaluate their total effort to ensure it's within the LIMIT. Considering the total effort of \"A43\" (79) + \"C55\" (388) + \"C42\" (548) = 1015, which is well below the LIMIT, this seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A43', 'C55', 'C42'} \nARGUMENT: I propose starting with a set of items that balances effort and importance, including \"A43\" and \"C55\", which are high in importance to me and relatively low in effort, along with \"C42\" to add more value without exceeding the LIMIT.",
