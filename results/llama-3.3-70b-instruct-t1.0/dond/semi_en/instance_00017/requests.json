Flipping for the coin sounds like a fair way to decide, it adds an element of chance to the negotiation. Let's do it, you get the candies, I get the plates and lemons, and we can flip for the coin.

I don't have any other proposals to make, so let's accept this deal and submit our proposals. I'll make sure to get the candies, and we can flip for the coin as agreed.
