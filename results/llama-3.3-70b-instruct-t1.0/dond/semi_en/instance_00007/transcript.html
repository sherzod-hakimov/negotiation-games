        <p>That&#x27;s a more modest proposal, but it&#x27;s still a possible starting point. I&#x27;m interested in acquiring both wires, so giving up one cup for one wire and one needle seems like a reasonable compromise. However, I&#x27;d like to get a sense of your interest in the glasses as well. Are you looking to acquire any of those, or are you focused primarily on the cups and the trade we&#x27;re discussing?</p>
