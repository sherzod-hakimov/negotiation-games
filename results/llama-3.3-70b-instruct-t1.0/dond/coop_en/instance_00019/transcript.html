        <p>The card isn&#x27;t really important to me, I can definitely let it go if it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re interested in. How about we discuss the hooks, would you be willing to let me have one of them if I&#x27;m willing to give up something else?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s a good point about the card, I do have some interest in it. As for the hooks, I&#x27;m not particularly attached to them, so I&#x27;d be willing to let you have one.

        <p>That sounds like a reasonable proposal, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m ready to give up on the flower just yet. How about we compromise, I get both hooks, and we split the other items, you get the eraser, sponge, and card, and I get the flower?</p>
