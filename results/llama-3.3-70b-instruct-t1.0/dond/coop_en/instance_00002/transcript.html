        <p>I&#x27;m more interested in the fruits, to be honest. I think they&#x27;re a great value, and I&#x27;d love to get as many of those as possible. The phone is nice, but it&#x27;s not my top priority. What do you think about the mirrors? Are you interested in those at all?</p>

        <p>The mirrors are okay, I think they&#x27;re decent. I could see us splitting those, maybe you take one and I take the other? That way, we both get something. The phone is still my top priority, but if you&#x27;re not as interested in it, maybe we can work out a deal where I get the phone and you get the fruits, and then we figure out the mirrors?</p>

        <p>Splitting the mirrors sounds like a fair idea. And I like where you&#x27;re going with the phone and fruits deal. If you get the phone, I&#x27;d be happy to take both fruits. That way, we both get something we really want. Then, we can finalize the mirror split, maybe I&#x27;ll take one and you take the other, like you suggested. Does that sound like a good starting point for an agreement?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great starting point. I think we&#x27;re on the same page. So, to recap, I&#x27;d get the phone, you&#x27;d get both fruits, and we&#x27;d split the mirrors, with you taking one and me taking the other. I think that&#x27;s a fair deal. Before we finalize, I just want to make sure we&#x27;re both comfortable with it. Do you think this split will work for you, or is there anything else you&#x27;d like to negotiate?</p>
