I will forward it to your partner.\\ \tt 2. `MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)`: to move an object to a new position, where `<X>` is the column and `<Y>` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.\\ \tt * If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.\\ \tt * If both players accumulate more than 16 penalties, you both lose the game.\\ \tt * It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state!

	 SAY: Focusing on the top part of the board for 'A', 'D', 'M', 'O', and 'P' is a good strategy since they are already aligned on my board. For 'S' and 'T', given the frame constraints, we should consider alternative positions that are as close as possible to the target positions. Since 'T' is already at (1,7) on my board, which is its target position, our main concern is 'S'. Let's aim to move 'S' to a position that is closest to (1,6) without being obstructed by the frame. Considering the grid layout, moving 'S' to (1,6) is not possible due to the '─' obstacle. An alternative could be to leave 'S' in a position that, although not perfect, is as close as possible to the intended alignment. Given the constraints and the remaining moves, let's discuss if we should start considering when to say "finished" and end the game, aiming to preserve our score and avoid further penalties.

Since 'T' is correctly placed on your board and we've discussed the challenges with placing 'S' due to the frame obstacles, it seems we've done our best with the moves available. Considering the rules and the goal to maximize our score by having identical objects in the same coordinates, I think we should assess if our current alignment is sufficient to end the game with a respectable score. Given that we have 7 remaining rounds and the risk of incurring more penalties, I suggest we prepare to conclude the game. Before we make any final decisions, I'd like to confirm our current alignment and ensure we're both on the same page regarding our final board states. After that, I propose we consider saying "finished" to conclude the game, ensuring we don't accumulate unnecessary penalties. What's your view on this approach?

Given the current state of our boards and the constraints we're facing, especially with 'S' and the frame obstacles, it seems we've reached an optimal alignment considering the circumstances.
