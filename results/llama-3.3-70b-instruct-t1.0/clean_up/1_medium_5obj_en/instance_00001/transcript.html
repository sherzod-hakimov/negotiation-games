        <p>I am your game master, and you are playing a collaborative game with the following grid as game board:<br/><br/>```<br/> 1234567<br/>╔═══╤═╤═╗<br/>║C◌◌│◌│◌║ 1<br/>║◌I◌│◌├─╢ 2<br/>║◌◌◌├─┘◌║ 3<br/>║◌◌◌│◌◌◌║ 4<br/>╟─┬─┼───╢ 5<br/>║◌│◌│◌WT║ 6<br/>║◌│◌│◌◌H║ 7<br/>╚═╧═╧═══╝<br/><br/>```<br/><br/>* The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.<br/>* The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: &#x27;W&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27;.<br/><br/><br/>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player&#x27;s board, and they cannot see yours.<br/><br/><br/>**Goal:**<br/><br/>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.<br/><br/><br/>**Rules:**<br/><br/>* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:<br/> 1. `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.<br/>2. `MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)`: to move an object to a new position, where `&lt;X&gt;` is the column and `&lt;Y&gt;` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.<br/>* If you don&#x27;t stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.<br/>* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.<br/>* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;` command!<br/><br/><br/>**Moving Objects**<br/><br/>* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol &#x27;◌&#x27;.<br/>* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.<br/>* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!<br/><br/><br/>**End of Game**<br/><br/>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.<br/><br/>Both players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.<br/><br/>**Scoring:**<br/><br/>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?<br/><br/><br/>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p>

        <p>SAY: Yes, discussing potential conflicts is a good idea. Since we can only move one object at a time and we can&#x27;t move an object to a cell that&#x27;s already occupied, we should try to move objects that are currently in the first row or are blocking the path to the first row first. We should also try to create a &quot;path&quot; for each object to reach its target position without having to move it back and forth.

What object did you move and where did you move it to? This will help me update my understanding of your board and plan my next move to get my objects in the correct positions. Also, I&#x27;ll start thinking about moving my &#x27;H&#x27; object from (5,6) to the first row, and then I&#x27;ll focus on moving my &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, and &#x27;W&#x27; objects to their correct positions in the alphabetical order. Please share the details of your move, and we can proceed from there.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>What is your next command?</p>

        <p>SAY: I moved the &#x27;T&#x27; object to (5,1). My board is now updated, and I&#x27;ve made progress towards achieving the alphabetical order. I see that my &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27;, and &#x27;T&#x27; objects are now in place. Next, I&#x27;ll focus on moving my &#x27;I&#x27; object to its correct position. I&#x27;ll move it from (6,6) to (4,1), but I realize that (4,1) is not empty. I&#x27;ll need to find an alternative path or move another object to make space.

        <p>SAY: Congratulations on making progress with your &#x27;T&#x27; object! Now, regarding your &#x27;I&#x27; object, I understand the challenge. Since (4,1) is not empty, you&#x27;ll need to find an alternative path or move another object to make space. On my board, I still need to move my &#x27;H&#x27; object from (5,6) to the first row. Considering our shared goal, I think it&#x27;s essential to focus on moving our &#x27;I&#x27; objects to their correct positions. Why don&#x27;t we try to move our &#x27;I&#x27; objects to the correct positions simultaneously? I can try to move my &#x27;I&#x27; object from (2,2) to (4,1) is not possible because it might be occupied, so I&#x27;ll try to find an alternative path. Perhaps we can discuss possible alternative paths or moves that can help us achieve our goal. What do you think? Should we explore alternative paths or make other moves to create space for our &#x27;I&#x27; objects?</p>

        <p>SAY: I think exploring these options is a great idea. On my board, moving my &#x27;I&#x27; object from (2,2) to (3,2) could be a good starting point.
