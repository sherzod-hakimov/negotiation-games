            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 3218. The key here is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see which ones are feasible. Let me list out the items and their efforts:\n\nA19: 919\nB91: 852\nA30: 299\nB11: 762\nC47: 161\nC75: 205\nC26: 380\nC73: 399\nA47: 534\nA15: 333\nA75: 100\nA39: 420\nA56: 354\nC24: 130\nB26: 589\n\nAdding these up: Let's see. Let me add them step by step.\n\nStart with A19 (919) + B91 (852) = 1771. Then A30 (299) makes 2070. B11 (762) would be 2832. That's already over 3218. So including B11 might be a problem. Let's check other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe prioritize items with high importance to me. Let me look at my importance values:\n\nA19: 138\nB91: 583\nA30: 868 (high)\nB11: 822 (high)\nC47: 783 (high)\nC75: 65 (low)\nC26: 262\nC73: 121\nA47: 508\nA15: 780 (high)\nA75: 461\nA39: 484\nA56: 668 (high)\nC24: 389\nB26: 808 (high)\n\nSo the high importance items for me are A30, B11, C47, A15, A56, B26. These are the ones I should try to include. But their efforts need to be considered.\n\nLet me calculate the effort for these high importance items:\n\nA30: 299\nB11: 762\nC47: 161\nA15: 333\nA56: 354\nB26: 589\n\nAdding these: 299 + 762 = 1061; +161 = 1222; +333 = 1555; +354 = 1909; +589 = 2498. That's under 3218. So maybe this set is possible. But maybe there's room to add more items. Let's see the remaining effort: 3218 - 2498 = 720. What other items can I add?\n\nLooking at other items:\n\nA19: 919 (too much)\nB91: 852 (too much)\nC75: 205 (could add)\nC26: 380 (could add)\nA47: 534 (could add)\nA75: 100 (could add)\nA39: 420 (could add)\nC73: 399 (could add)\nC24: 130 (could add)\n\nSo adding C75 (205) would bring total to 2498+205=2703. Then maybe C24 (130) makes 2833. Then A75 (100) is 2933. Then C26 (380) would be 3313, which is over. So maybe A75 and C24. Let's check:\n\n2498 + 205 (C75) = 2703. Then add C24 (130) = 2833. Then A75 (100) = 2933. Then maybe A39 (420) would be 3353, which is over. So maybe A75 and C24. That's 2833. Then maybe C73 (399) would be 2833+399=3232, which is over. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe add A75 (100) and C24 (130) to the initial set. That's 2498 + 100 + 130 = 2728. Then maybe add C75 (205) would be 2933. Then maybe C26 (380) is 3313, which is over. So perhaps the initial set plus C75 and C24. That's 2498 + 205 + 130 = 2833. Then maybe add A75 (100) to get 2933. That's under 3218. So total effort would be 2933. That's acceptable.\n\nBut I need to check if this is the best possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some high importance items to include others. But since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should prioritize the high importance items first.\n\nAnother approach: sort items by importance to me in descending order and pick as many as possible without exceeding the limit.\n\nSorted list (importance descending):\n\nA30: 868\nB11: 822\nC47: 783\nA15: 780\nB26: 808 (wait, B26 is 808, which is higher than A15's 780. So order would be A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, etc.)\n\nWait, let me re-sort:\n\nA30: 868\nB11: 822\nB26: 808\nC47: 783\nA15: 780\nA56: 668\nB91: 583\nA47: 508\nA75: 461\nA39: 484\nC24: 389\nC26: 262\nC73: 121\nC75: 65\nA19: 138\n\nSo the order is A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, B91, A47, A75, A39, C24, C26, C73, C75, A19.\n\nNow, let's try to pick items in this order, adding their effort until we reach the limit.\n\nStart with A30 (299). Total effort: 299. Importance: 868.\n\nAdd B11 (762). Total effort: 299+762=1061. Importance: 868+822=1690.\n\nAdd B26 (589). Total effort: 1061+589=1650. Importance: 1690+808=2498.\n\nAdd C47 (161). Total effort: 1650+161=1811. Importance: 2498+783=3281.\n\nAdd A15 (333). Total effort: 1811+333=2144. Importance: 3281+780=4061.\n\nAdd A56 (354). Total effort: 2144+354=2498. Importance: 4061+668=4729.\n\nAdd B91 (852). Total effort: 2498+852=3350. That's over 3218. So can't add B91.\n\nNext is A47 (534). 2498+534=3032. Still under. Importance: 4729+508=5237.\n\nAdd A75 (100). Total effort: 3032+100=3132. Importance: 5237+461=5698.\n\nAdd A39 (420). 3132+420=3552. Over. So can't add.\n\nNext is C24 (130). 3132+130=3262. Over. So can't add.\n\nC26 (380): 3132+380=3512. Over.\n\nC73 (399): same issue.\n\nC75 (205): 3132+205=3337. Over.\n\nA19 (919): way over.\n\nSo the maximum importance I can get is 5698 by including A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, A47, A75. Total effort 3132. That's under 3218. Wait, 3132 is under 3218. So that's a valid set. But maybe there's a way to add more items. Let's check the remaining effort: 3218 - 3132 = 86. Are there any items with effort <=86? Looking at the list:\n\nC75 is 205, which is over. C24 is 130, over. C26 is 380. A75 is 100. So no. So the maximum possible is 5698.\n\nBut maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I exclude A75 (100) and add something else. But A75's importance is 461, which is higher than any other item that could fit in 86. So it's better to include A75.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A47 (508) and add something else. But A47's importance is 508, which is higher than any other item that could fit. So including A47 is better.\n\nSo the optimal set for me is A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, A47, A75. Total effort 3132. That's under the limit. So this would be my proposal.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this set is within the limit. Let me recalculate the effort:\n\nA30: 299\nB11: 762 → 299+762=1061\nB26: 589 → 1061+589=1650\nC47: 161 → 1650+161=1811\nA15: 333 → 1811+333=2144\nA56: 354 → 2144+354=2498\nA47: 534 → 2498+534=3032\nA75: 100 → 3032+100=3132. Yes, correct.\n\nSo this set is valid. Now, I need to propose this set. But since I don't know the other person's importance, I have to hope that this set is also good for them. However, since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should propose this set.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might have different importance values. However, since I can't know that, I have to proceed with my own optimal set.\n\nSo my first proposal would be the set {A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, A47, A75}. Let me check if this is under the limit. Yes, 3132.\n\nNow, I need to structure this as a PROPOSAL. The format is PROPOSAL: {'A30', 'B11', 'B26', 'C47', 'A15', 'A56', 'A47', 'A75'}\n\nBut I should also include an ARGUMENT. The argument should defend my proposal. For example, I can mention that I selected items with high importance to me while keeping the effort under the limit.\n\nSo the message would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A30', 'B11', 'B26', 'C47', 'A15', 'A56', 'A47', 'A75'}\nARGUMENT: I selected items with high importance to me while ensuring the total effort does not exceed the limit. This set maximizes my total importance based on my own values.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is included. Also, the AGREE is not needed here unless the other person accepts. But since this is the first message, I should propose this set and argue for it.\n",

Total effort: 299. Importance: 868.\n\nAdd B11 (762). Total effort: 299+762=1061. Importance: 868+822=1690.\n\nAdd B26 (589). Total effort: 1061+589=1650. Importance: 1690+808=2498.\n\nAdd C47 (161). Total effort: 1650+161=1811. Importance: 2498+783=3281.\n\nAdd A15 (333). Total effort: 1811+333=2144. Importance: 3281+780=4061.\n\nAdd A56 (354). Total effort: 2144+354=2498. Importance: 4061+668=4729.\n\nAdd B91 (852). Total effort: 2498+852=3350. That's over 3218. So can't add B91.\n\nNext is A47 (534). 2498+534=3032. Still under. Importance: 4729+508=5237.\n\nAdd A75 (100). Total effort: 3032+100=3132. Importance: 5237+461=5698.\n\nAdd A39 (420). 3132+420=3552. Over. So can't add.\n\nNext is C24 (130). 3132+130=3262. Over. So can't add.\n\nC26 (380): 3132+380=3512. Over.\n\nC73 (399): same issue.\n\nC75 (205): 3132+205=3337. Over.\n\nA19 (919): way over.\n\nSo the maximum importance I can get is 5698 by including A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, A47, A75. Total effort 3132. That's under 3218. Wait, 3132 is under 3218.

So including A47 is better.\n\nSo the optimal set for me is A30, B11, B26, C47, A15, A56, A47, A75. Total effort 3132. That's under the limit.

Yes, correct.\n\nSo this set is valid. Now, I need to propose this set. But since I don't know the other person's importance, I have to hope that this set is also good for them. However, since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should propose this set.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might have different importance values.

Let me check if this is under the limit. Yes, 3132.\n\nNow, I need to structure this as a PROPOSAL.
