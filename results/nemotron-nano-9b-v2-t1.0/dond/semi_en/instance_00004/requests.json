My value function is orange:5, pepper:2, picture:1. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's complementary, meaning we can both get what we want without overlapping items.\n\nFirst, I should think about what items I value the most. The orange is worth 5 to me, which is the highest. Then pepper is 2, and pictures are 1 each. Since there are 3 pictures, maybe I can take some of them. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine.\n\nIf I propose taking the orange and maybe some pictures, that might be good. But I need to leave enough items for the other player. Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and the pepper, but that's two items. Wait, but the other player might also want those. Since I don't know their values, I have to make an assumption. Maybe they value the orange less, but I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That way, I get the highest value item and a lower one. Then the other player could take the pepper and the remaining two pictures. But I need to check if that's possible. The total items are 1 orange, 1 pepper, 3 pictures. If I take orange and 1 picture, that's 2 items. The other player would need to take pepper and 2 pictures. That's 3 items. That works. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value for the pepper is higher. If they value pepper more than I do, then taking the pepper might be better for them. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. That would give me 5+2=7 points. But if the other player also wants those, then it's not complementary. So that's risky. \n\nAnother approach: since there are 3 pictures, maybe I can take all three. But that's 3*1=3 points. But if the other player can take the orange and pepper, that's better for them. But again, I don't know their values. \n\nWait, the key is to make a proposal that is complementary. So I need to propose items that the other player can also get their items without overlapping. So if I take the orange and one picture, the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the orange and the pepper, then the other player can't take those, so they would have to take the three pictures. But if their value for the pictures is low, maybe that's not good. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to take the orange and pepper. \n\nBut the problem is that if I take both, the other player might not have anything left. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So if I propose orange and pepper, and the other player proposes something else, like the three pictures, then it's complementary. \n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player can also get their items. So maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. Then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That way, all items are distributed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. Then the other player can take the three pictures. But if the other player's value for the pictures is low, maybe that's not ideal. But since I don't know, I have to make a choice. \n\nAnother thought: since the orange is the most valuable to me, I should definitely take it. Then, for the other items, maybe take the pepper as well. But again, if the other player also wants the pepper, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the orange and leave the pepper and pictures for the other player. But that would give me only 5 points. If I can get the pepper as well, that's 7. \n\nBut the risk is that if the other player also wants the pepper, then my proposal would conflict. So maybe it's safer to take the orange and some pictures. \n\nWait, the other player's value function is secret. So I can't know. But maybe I can assume that they might value the pepper or pictures. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then it's okay. But if they do, then it's not complementary. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is when I send the [Proposal: ...] format. \n\nSo maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me think. If I propose the orange and the pepper, that's two items. The other player would need to propose items that don't include those. So they could take the three pictures. That would be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the orange and one picture, then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. \n\nWhich is better for me? If I take orange (5) and pepper (2), total 7. If I take orange (5) and one picture (1), total 6. So 7 is better. But the risk is that the other player might also want the pepper. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe it's better to take the orange and pepper. Because even if the other player values the pepper, maybe they can't get it if I take it. Wait, no. If I propose the orange and pepper, and the other player proposes something else, then it's complementary. \n\nBut if the other player also proposes the pepper, then it's not complementary. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That way, the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That's a safe bet. \n\nBut I need to decide. Since the orange is the highest value, I should definitely take it. Then, for the other items, maybe take the pepper. But if the other player also wants the pepper, then it's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the orange and leave the pepper and pictures for the other player. But that would give me only 5. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to propose the orange and the pepper. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then I get both. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, maybe it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That way, the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That's a safer proposal. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let me go with proposing the orange and the pepper.

But I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That's 5+1=6. Then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. If they value the pepper, that's good for them. \n\nBut I think the orange is the most important. So I'll go with proposing the orange and the pepper. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets. So the message would be: [Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]. \n\nWait, but the format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So for example, \"1 orange, 1 pepper\". \n\nYes. So that's the proposal. Then, if the other player's proposal doesn't include those items, it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the orange. Then the other player can take the rest. But that's 5 points. \n\nBut if I can get the pepper as well, that's better. \n\nSo I think the best proposal is to take the orange and the pepper. Let me send that as the secret proposal.\n",

For example, if I propose only the orange, and they propose the pepper, then we can both get them. But if they also propose the orange, then we conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most. So I should propose the orange and pepper. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets, like \"[Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]\".\n\nBut wait, the user said that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal. So I need to decide what to propose. Since I can't see their proposal, I have to make an educated guess. But given that I don't have any information about their proposal, maybe I should just propose the items I want. So I'll go with orange and pepper. That's my best chance to get them. If they also proposed them, we both get zero. But if not, I get them. Since the alternative is to get nothing, it's better to take the risk.\n",
