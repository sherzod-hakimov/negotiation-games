The items available are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, and 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:6, berry:0, bowl:1, glass:1. So the shovel is super valuable to me, but berries don't matter. The bowl and glasses each give me 1 point each.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. But since I can't know, I should focus on my own values. The key is to get the shovel because that's worth 6 to me. The other items are less valuable. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or maybe they can take the rest. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some other items that I don't care about, like berries, to make sure the other player can take the rest. \n\nWait, but if I propose the shovel, and the other player also proposes the shovel, then we can't both have it, so we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn't conflict with theirs. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose the shovel and some other items that I don't value much, so that the other player can take the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some berries, but since berries are worthless to me, maybe the other player might want them. But if I take the berries, that might not be good. Hmm. \n\nWait, the problem is that I have to make a secret proposal. The other player will also make a secret proposal.

So the goal is to propose items that the other player isn't proposing. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some items that I don't care about, so that the other player can take the rest.

Wait, but if I propose the shovel and some berries, and the other player proposes the bowl and glasses, then maybe we can split. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl, since the bowl is worth 1 to me. But if the other player also wants the bowl, that's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. Since glasses are worth 1 each, but I have 3.

Since berries are worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values them. If they take the berries, that's good for them, but I don't lose anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just propose the shovel. Because if I can get the shovel, that's 6 points. The other items are less valuable. So if I can get the shovel, that's the best. \n\nBut how to ensure that the other player doesn't also propose the shovel. Since I can't know, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some other items that I don't care about. \n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that there are enough items to fulfill both.

But since berries are worth 0 to me, that's okay. \n\nBut if the other player also wants the shovel, then we can't. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the shovel. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. \n\nBut again, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. \n\nBut I think the safest is to propose the shovel. Because that's the highest value item. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel]. \n\nBut maybe I can add some other items. For example, [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. \n\nBut if the other player also wants the bowl, then conflict. \n\nAlternatively, [Proposal: 1 shovel, 2 berries]. \n\nBut again, same issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. \n\nBut I think the key is to get the shovel. So I'll go with that. \n\nSo my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 shovel]. \n\nBut maybe I should also include some other items to make it more likely that the other player can take the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the berries. \n\nBut since berries are worthless to me, maybe the other player would take them. \n\nBut if I take the berries, that's not good. Wait, no, if I propose the shovel and berries, and the other player takes the berries, then I can get the shovel. \n\nBut if the other player also wants the shovel, then we can't. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the shovel. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. \n\nBut again, same problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. \n\nBut I think the best is to propose the shovel. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 1 shovel].\n",

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. First, I need to figure out what the other player's proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don't have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, right, in the initial setup, the user is supposed to simulate the other player's proposal. But in this case, the user hasn't provided the other player's proposal. Wait, maybe this is part of a role-play where I have to imagine the other player's proposal. But since I don't have that data, how can I proceed?\n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on my own value function. But the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. So I need to respond to that. But without knowing what the other player proposed, I can't make an informed decision. This is a bit confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps in the context of this exercise, the other player's proposal is not given, and I have to make a proposal that would be optimal given my own value function. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning they don't overlap in items, then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that the other player isn't proposing, so that my proposal and theirs can be complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that covers items I value highly, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value the most, and if the other player's proposal is different, then we can both get points. But without knowing their proposal, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something I need to infer. But since this is a simulation, perhaps I should proceed by making a proposal that maximizes my own value, assuming that the other player's proposal is not conflicting. For example, if I propose items that I value highly, like the shovel and bowl, which are worth 4 each. The other player might have proposed different items. \n\nWait, the available items are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:4, berry:1, bowl:4, glass:0. So I should prioritize shovel and bowl. If I propose those, and the other player's proposal doesn't include them, then I can get both. But if the other player also proposed those, then we can't both get them. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible. Let me think. The maximum I can get is 4+4=8 if I get both shovel and bowl. But if the other player also wants those, then we can't. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be wanted by the other player. But without knowing their value function, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something I can't know, so I have to make a proposal that is optimal for me. So I should propose the items I value the most. So shovel and bowl. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: \"[Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]\". \n\nBut wait, the other player might have proposed something else. For example, if they proposed berries and glasses, then my proposal of shovel and bowl would be complementary. But if they proposed shovel and bowl, then we can't both get them. \n\nBut since I don't have that info, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most. So I'll go with shovel and bowl. That's my best bet. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose more items. But since I have limited messages, but the secret proposal is a one-time thing. So I should make sure my proposal is as valuable as possible. \n\nAnother thought: the other player's proposal is secret, so I can't know. But maybe the optimal strategy is to propose items that are unique or that I value highly. Since I value shovel and bowl the most, I should propose those. \n\nSo I think the best move is to submit a secret proposal for shovel and bowl. That way, if the other player didn't propose those, I can get them. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n",

                "text": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. First, I need to figure out what the other player's proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don't have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, right, in the initial setup, the user is supposed to simulate the other player's proposal. But in this case, the user hasn't provided the other player's proposal. Wait, maybe this is part of a role-play where I have to imagine the other player's proposal. But since I don't have that data, how can I proceed?\n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on my own value function. But the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. So I need to respond to that. But without knowing what the other player proposed, I can't make an informed decision. This is a bit confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps in the context of this exercise, the other player's proposal is not given, and I have to make a proposal that would be optimal given my own value function. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning they don't overlap in items, then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that the other player isn't proposing, so that my proposal and theirs can be complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that covers items I value highly, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value the most, and if the other player's proposal is different, then we can both get points. But without knowing their proposal, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something I need to infer. But since this is a simulation, perhaps I should proceed by making a proposal that maximizes my own value, assuming that the other player's proposal is not conflicting. For example, if I propose items that I value highly, like the shovel and bowl, which are worth 4 each. The other player might have proposed different items. \n\nWait, the available items are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:4, berry:1, bowl:4, glass:0. So I should prioritize shovel and bowl. If I propose those, and the other player's proposal doesn't include them, then I can get both. But if the other player also proposed those, then we can't both get them. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible. Let me think. The maximum I can get is 4+4=8 if I get both shovel and bowl. But if the other player also wants those, then we can't. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be wanted by the other player. But without knowing their value function, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something I can't know, so I have to make a proposal that is optimal for me. So I should propose the items I value the most. So shovel and bowl. Let me check the format.
