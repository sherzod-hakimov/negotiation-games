The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should focus on the items I value, which are bolts. There are 2 bolts. If I can get both bolts, that would give me 10 points. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items.

But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't also take bolts. However, since I don't know their values, maybe they might also want bolts.

But since I don't value crayons or chalk, that might not be good. Wait, but if I take one bolt and something else, maybe the other player can take the other bolt. But that would split the bolts, which might be worse for me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking both bolts. Let me think. If I propose [Proposal: 2 bolts], then the other player's proposal would need to not include any bolts. If they propose something else, then it's okay.

That's 2+3=5. If the other's proposal is 1 crayon and 1 bolt, then total crayons 3, chalk 1, bolts 1. That works. So that's a possible proposal.\n\nBut again, without knowing the other's proposal, it's hard. However, since the other player's proposal is secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, assuming that the other's proposal is not conflicting. So maybe propose 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That's 7 points. If the other's proposal is something that doesn't take those, then I get 7. If it does, then maybe I get less or zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 1 bolt. That's 5. But maybe that's safer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 3 crayons. That's 3 points. But that's lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 1 crayon. That's 3+1=4. But again, depends.\n\nBut since I need to make a proposal, I think the best is to go for the highest value items. So 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That's 7. Let me check if that's possible. The available items are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, 2 bolts. So if I take 1 chalk and 2 bolts, that's all the chalk and all the bolts. Then the other player can't take any of those. So if their proposal includes chalk or bolts, it would conflict. But if their proposal is only crayons, then it's okay.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe this is a good proposal. Alternatively, if I propose 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that's 5. But maybe that's less risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 crayons and 1 chalk, then I could propose 1 crayon and 2 bolts. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nIn the absence of information, I think the best is to propose the items I value most. So chalk (3) and bolts (2). So 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That's 7. So I'll go with that.\n",
