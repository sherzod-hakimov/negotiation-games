My value function is bowl:5, bottle:5, fruit:0, eraser:0. So I really want the bowl and bottle, and the fruits and eraser don't matter to me. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my chances of getting the items I value. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other's don't overlap on items that are limited. \n\nSince I have a secret proposal option, maybe I should make a secret proposal to get the items I want. But the problem is that if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know what I'm proposing. Wait, no. The secret proposal is made by me, and the other player would have to accept it. But how does that work? The rules say that you can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So if I make a secret proposal, that's one message, and the other player can either accept or reject. But since the other player's value function is unknown, maybe I should propose the items I want, and hope they accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send messages to negotiate. But since I can only send 5 messages, and the other player can too, but I need to be efficient. \n\nLet me think. My goal is to get the bowl and bottle. The other player might also want those. So if I propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes something else, maybe we can agree. But if they also want those, then we might have a conflict. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value most. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. That way, if the other player accepts, I get both. If they don't, then maybe they propose something else. But if they also propose the same items, then we can't both have them, so both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player might propose to take the fruits and eraser. But since the fruits and eraser are worthless to me, that's okay.

That way, if the other player is okay with that, I get them. If not, maybe they can propose something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player first. For example, \"I want the bowl and bottle. What do you want?\" But the problem is that messages are transmitted directly, so I need to be careful not to include any response to the rules. \n\nWait, the instructions say that unless it's the secret proposal, messages are directly transmitted. So I can send messages to the other player, but they have to be in the form of proposals or other messages. \n\nBut the secret proposal is a specific format. So maybe I should first send a message to the other player, like \"I'm proposing to take the bowl and bottle. Do you agree?\" But the other player might not respond, or they might have their own proposal. \n\nAlternatively, since I can make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should just make that proposal immediately. Because if I don't, the other player might make a proposal that conflicts with mine. \n\nBut if I make a secret proposal, the other player can either accept or reject. If they accept, then we both get the items. If they reject, then maybe they can make their own proposal. \n\nBut since I don't know their value function, maybe the best is to propose the items I want.

So I'll go with the secret proposal for bowl and bottle. \n\nWait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So if I propose bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes something else, like fruits and eraser, then it's complementary. But if the other player also proposes bowl and bottle, then it's not complementary. \n\nSo maybe I should make a secret proposal for bowl and bottle.

So perhaps this is a test case where I need to generate a proposal based on the items and my value function, assuming that the other player's proposal is something that I need to respond to.

But since I don't know their proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that maximizes my value, considering possible overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer. But without that info, I can't. So perhaps the correct approach is to make a proposal that includes items I value highly, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. For example, since I value fruits and eraser highly (3 each), I should try to get those. The bowl is only worth 1, and the bottle is 0. So maybe I should propose taking the two fruits and the eraser.

Alternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is different. For example, if they take the bowl and bottle, then I can take the fruits and eraser.

For example, if I propose taking the two fruits and the eraser, and the other player's proposal is something else, then we can both get points. But if their proposal is similar, then we both get zero. So the risk is there. But given that I have to make a proposal, I should go for the highest value items.
