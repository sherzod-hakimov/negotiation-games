So I really want the soap and thimble, but stamps don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should assume they have different preferences. But how?\n\nThe key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the items they request must not overlap. So if I take the soap and thimble, the other player can't take those. But if I take stamps, maybe they can take the soap and thimble. Wait, but stamps are 4, so maybe they can take some stamps if they value them.\n\nBut since my stamps are worthless, I should probably give them all the stamps. But if I do that, maybe the other player can take the soap and thimble. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn't conflict with mine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the soap and thimble, and the other player can take the stamps. But if they don't value stamps, then their score would be zero. But if they do value stamps, then that's better. But since I don't know their values, I have to make an assumption.\n\nWait, the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So I need to find a division where the total value (my value plus theirs) is as high as possible. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should try to get the items I value and give them the rest. But if they value the stamps, then giving them stamps would help. But if they don't, then maybe they can take other items.\n\nBut since I don't have their value function, maybe I should propose taking the soap and thimble, and let them take the stamps. That way, if they value stamps, they get something, and I get the high-value items. If they don't, then they get nothing, but I still get the high-value items. That might be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the soap and some stamps, but since stamps are worthless to me, that's not helpful.

So I need to send that.\n\nBut the other player might have different preferences. For example, if they value stamps highly, then giving them stamps would be good. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes the possible total.

If they don't value stamps, then their score is 0, total 10. But if I give them the soap and thimble, then I get nothing, and they get 3+7=10, but that's worse for me. So the best is to take the soap and thimble, and give them the stamps. That way, even if they don't value stamps, I still get the maximum possible for myself, and if they do, the total is higher.\n\nSo my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 thimble].

So maybe I should propose the thimble and as many stamps as possible, but that might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap, since I don't value it, but that might not help.

For example, if I propose the thimble and 2 stamps, and they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, then we can split the stamps. But if they proposed the thimble, then we can't. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose the thimble and some stamps, and the soap. Wait, but I don't value the soap. So maybe I should propose the thimble and stamps, and leave the soap for them. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap, since I don't value it, but that might not help. Or maybe propose nothing, but that would result in zero points. That's not good.\n\nWait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if we can get both proposals to be complementary, that's best. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn't overlap. But since I don't know theirs, maybe I should propose items that are not in high demand. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they are also trying to maximize their own score, they might propose items they value. But since I don't know their value function, I can't assume that. So this is a problem.\n\nIn this case, maybe the best I can do is to propose my most valuable items, and hope that their proposal doesn't conflict. So I'll propose the thimble and some stamps. Let's say I propose the thimble and 2 stamps. That way, if they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can't. But since I don't know, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe propose the thimble and 1 stamp, leaving more stamps for them. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap, since I don't value it, but that might not help. Or maybe propose nothing, but that's worse.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their score. So if I can make a proposal that is complementary to theirs, even if I don't know theirs, that's the way to go. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so the best I can do is to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complementary. For example, if I propose the thimble and 2 stamps, and they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, then we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can't. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose the thimble and 2 stamps, and hope that they didn't propose the thimble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the stamps. Since there are 4, and I value them. If I propose 4 stamps, then if they proposed something else, we can both get stamps. But if they also proposed stamps, then we can't. But again, without knowing, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and the soap. But since I don't value the soap, that might not be good. But if the other player values the soap, then maybe they would take it. But again, I don't know.\n\nThis is really tricky. Since I don't have information about their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of being complementary. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and leave some items for them. For example, propose the thimble and 2 stamps. That way, if they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can't. But since I don't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and 1 stamp, leaving 3 stamps for them. But again, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and some stamps. But since I don't value the soap, that might not be good. Unless the other player values it, but I don't know.\n\nHmm. Maybe the safest bet is to propose the thimble and some stamps. Let's go with that. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 stamps]. That way, if they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can't. But since I don't know, this is the best I can do.\n",
