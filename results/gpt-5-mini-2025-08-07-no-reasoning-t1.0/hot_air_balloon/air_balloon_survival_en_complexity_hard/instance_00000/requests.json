But total effort would exceed limit, so select the best mix by ratio and totals. I’ll favor high ratio and medium efforts: include A75(175/76), A08(231/132), C53(287/188), B69(338/239), C17(400/301), A65(401/302), C51(409/310), B96(474/375), B19(487/388), B34(519/420), C72(530/431), B37(572/473), A46(639/540), A25(616/517), A71(687/588), A28(722/623), B23(756/657), B15(759/660), C79(817/718), B16(806/707), A39(807/708), C83(873/774), C10(884/785), A97(874/775), C84(867/768), A88(930/831), A96(987/888), C60(978/879), A94(1049/950). Now I must ensure effort ≤10073. I’ll greedily add by ratio until close to limit. I quickly approximate a solid set: prioritize low effort high value first: A75, A08, C53, B69, C17, A65, C51, B96, B19, B34, C72, B37, A46, A25, A71, A28, B23, B15, C79, B16, A39, C83, C10, A97, C84, A88, A96, C60. I’ll check cumulative effort roughly: 76+132+188+239+301+302+310+375+388+420+431+473+540+517+588+623+657+660+718+707+708+774+785+775+768+831+888+879 ≈ 14890 which is too high. Need a smaller core. I’ll instead propose a lean, efficient set around 10k effort with top value density: Include: A75(76), A08(132), C53(188), B69(239), B96(375), B19(388), B34(420), C72(431), B37(473), A46(540), A25(517), A71(588), A28(623), B23(657), B15(660). Effort sum ≈ 7306, value ≈ 231+... I will then add a few heavy hitters with good ratios: C83(774), C10(785), A97(775). Adding efforts 774+785+775=2334 → total ≈ 9640. Add one more mid: C51(310) -> 9950, or C17(301) -> 9941. I’ll pick C17 (higher ratio vs C51). Now 9640+301=9941. We still have 132 left; we can add A87(28 effort, 127 value) and C82(349) is too big; A08 already included; maybe A75 already; remaining items with effort ≤132: A87(28). Add A87 to reach 9969. We can try A08 already counted. Any item ≤104 effort? none. ≤ 132 left exactly 132 used by A08 but already in. So final proposal effort ≈ 9969, under 10073.

My original set effort estimate was ~9969. Adding 800 would exceed the limit, but they claim total 10070, implying my prior estimate was high. I’ll recompute precisely: Sum efforts of my items: A75(76)+A08(132)+C53(188)+B69(239)+B96(375)+B19(388)+B34(420)+C72(431)+B37(473)+A46(540)+A25(517)+A71(588)+A28(623)+B23(657)+B15(660)+C83(774)+C10(785)+A97(775)+C17(301)+A87(28) = 10070 - 800 = 9270. That implies my set is 9270, which seems plausible given my rough earlier calc. Adding B95 brings it to 10070 ≤ 10073, so valid. My importance for B95 is 899, which is huge. This is excellent for me. I should accept immediately to maximize my utility and end the game.'}\n\nAGREE: {'A75', 'A08', 'C53', 'B69', 'B96', 'B19', 'B34', 'C72', 'B37', 'A46', 'A25', 'A71', 'A28', 'B23', 'B15', 'C83', 'C10', 'A97', 'C17', 'A87', 'B95'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'Your addition keeps us under the limit and aligns well with my earlier structure. This is a strong, efficient set—let’s lock it in.'}",
