Calculate effort: C70 125; A27 106 (231); B10 116 (347); B45 60 (407); C34 54 (461); A84 136 (597); A30 213 (810); A08 607 (1417); A16 645 (2062); A66 517 (2579); B60 324 (2903); A89 262 (3165); A58 252 (3417); C35 106 (3523); B67 634 (4157); B94 630 (4787); B09 446 (5233); C81 601 (5834); C12 849 (6683); C15 875 (7558); This leaves 1212.

Any item ≤102 effort: none except C34(54) already, B45(60) already, C35(106) slightly over. A27 106 included. So total effort 8668 fits under 8770. Total value sum high. This is a strong maximal set.

My total importance for their set is: C70(968)+A27(822)+B10(623)+B45(461)+C34(484)+A84(500)+A30(739)+A08(868)+A16(856)+A66(822)+B60(808)+A89(508)+A58(457)+C35(444)+B67(780)+B94(783)+B09(786)+C81(713)+C12(668)+C15(781)+B12(915)+C92(215) = 14692. That’s very strong. I’ll see if I can squeeze in one or two more of my high-value items within limit: we have 8770-8668=102 slack, so only items with effort ≤102 can be added; none exist. Consider swaps: remove a low-importance-to-me item to add a higher-importance one of similar effort. Candidates to add (my high importance not included) sorted by value/effort: B21(138,830) low, B00(583,638), A23(262,773), C65(121,455), B53(65,382), B69(97,832), C06(30,980), B85(400,842), C24(273,763), B75(235,520), B46(606,407), A05(389,801), B16(3,649). The standout is B46 (606 importance, 407 effort). To add 407 effort, remove items totaling ≥305 effort beyond the 102 slack: candidates with low importance to me in current set: C92(215,164), B45(461,60) is high imp so keep, C34(484,54) high, A84(500,136) medium-high, A58(457,252), C35(444,106). Lowest importance present seems C92(215). Next lowest maybe A84(500) is not low. Maybe swap out C92(164 effort) plus something else like A58(252) total 416, to add B46(407). Importance change: -215 -457 +606 = -66 net loss, not good. What about replace C92(164) + C35(106)=270 to add B46(407) still need 37 more, maybe add remove B45(60) but that’s 461 importance lost; net -70. What about removing A84(136,500) + C92(164,215) = 300, still short 107; remove C34(54,484) => total 354, still short 53; remove B10(116,623) gets too costly. Try remove B60(324,808) + C92(164,215)=488 to add B46(407), net importance: -808 -215 +606 = -417, worse. Try swap in B00(583,638) by removing what? Need 638-102=536 effort freed; remove A84(136,500) + A58(252,457) + C92(164,215) = 552; importance: -500 -457 -215 +583 = -589 net. Not good. Any other high-value add? B21(138) not worth it.
