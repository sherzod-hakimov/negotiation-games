        "content": "That split you suggested works well for total value: I value the phone at 6, mirrors at 0, fruits at 2 each. If you take the phone, and I take the 2 mirrors and 2 fruits, total values are: you 6, me 4, combined 10 — that's optimal since total available value is 6 + 0*2 + 2*2 = 10.\n\nIf you'd prefer more balanced individual scores instead of maximizing total, another option is you take the phone plus 1 mirror, and I take 1 mirror and 2 fruits: you'd get 6, I'd get 4 — same as before. Alternatively you could take phone + a fruit (value 8 for you) and I take 2 mirrors + 1 fruit (value 2 for me), which is less balanced.\n\nDo you accept you taking the phone and me taking both fruits and both mirrors?"
