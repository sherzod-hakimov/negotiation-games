            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 hooks, 2 plates, and 1 bowl. My value function is hook:3, plate:1, bowl:2. The other player's values are unknown, but since we want to maximize the sum, I should consider possible allocations that are complementary.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that whatever I propose and the other player proposes, the total items they request don't exceed what's available. Since there are 2 hooks, 2 plates, and 1 bowl, any proposal that requires more than that in any category would make the proposals non-complementary, resulting in zero points for both. So the key is to propose items in a way that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly but also leave some items that the other player might value. But since the goal is the sum, perhaps a balanced approach is better. For example, if I take one hook and one plate, and leave the other hook, plate, and bowl for the other player. But I need to structure this into a proposal.\n\nWait, the proposal format is a list of items with numbers. So I need to specify how many of each item I want. Let me think. If I propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That would leave 1 hook, 1 plate, and 0 bowls. But the other player could then propose taking the remaining items. However, if the other player's proposal includes the remaining items, then it's complementary. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are high value for me but not too many, so that the other player can take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 1 hook and 1 bowl. That would leave 1 hook, 2 plates, and 0 bowls. Then the other player could take the remaining hook and plates. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky. But since the sum is what matters, maybe the best approach is to split the items as evenly as possible. For example, take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 0 bowls. Then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That way, all items are used. But I need to check if that's possible.\n\nWait, the items are 2 hooks, 2 plates, 1 bowl. If I take 1 hook, 1 plate, then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That uses all items. So that's complementary. But if I propose that, then the other player's proposal would need to take the remaining items. But since I don't know their values, maybe this is a safe bet. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 hook and 1 bowl, leaving 1 hook, 2 plates. Then the other player could take those. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 2 hooks. But that would leave 0 hooks, 2 plates, 1 bowl. Then the other player could take the plates and bowl. But if they value plates and bowl more, that's good. But if they don't, maybe not. But since the sum is the goal, maybe taking 2 hooks (which I value at 3 each) would give me 6, and the other player could take 2 plates (1 each) and 1 bowl (2), totaling 4. So total 10. Alternatively, if I take 1 hook (3), 1 plate (1), and 1 bowl (2), total 6. Then the other player takes 1 hook (3), 1 plate (1), total 4. Sum 10. Same total. But maybe there's a better split.\n\nWait, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, that's 3+1+2=6. The other player takes 1 hook, 1 plate. 3+1=4. Total 10. Alternatively, if I take 2 hooks (6) and the other player takes 2 plates (2) and 1 bowl (2), total 6+4=10. Same. So maybe either way. But maybe there's a way to get a higher total. For example, if I take 1 hook, 2 plates, and 1 bowl. But that would require 2 plates, which are available. But then the other player would have to take 1 hook. But that's 3 for me (hook) + 2 (plates) + 2 (bowl) = 7. The other player takes 1 hook (3). Total 10. Still same. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 0 bowls. Then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl. That's 3+1+2=6 for them. My total is 3+1=4. Sum 10. Same. So maybe all these splits result in 10. But maybe there's a way to get higher. Wait, what if I take 1 hook, 1 bowl, and the other player takes 1 hook, 2 plates. Then my value is 3+2=5, theirs is 3+2=5. Total 10. Still same. So maybe 10 is the maximum possible. But is there a way to get higher?\n\nWait, the total value of all items is 2*3 (hooks) + 2*1 (plates) + 1*2 (bowl) = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10. So the maximum possible sum is 10. So any allocation that uses all items will give a total of 10. So the key is to make sure that the proposals are complementary, i.e., they use all items. So the best strategy is to propose a set of items that, when combined with the other player's proposal, uses all items. Therefore, I need to propose a subset of items, and the other player's proposal should take the remaining items. But since I don't know their values, I need to propose in a way that maximizes the sum, which is fixed at 10 if all items are used. So the goal is to ensure that the proposals are complementary. Therefore, I should propose a set of items, and the other player's proposal should take the rest. But how to structure this in the message.\n\nThe user's instruction says that I can send a maximum of 5 messages, but I can also make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. But what should I propose?\n\nIf I propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, that's 3+1+2=6. Then the other player would need to propose the remaining 1 hook and 1 plate. If they do that, the total is 6+4=10. Alternatively, if I propose 2 hooks, then the other player can take 2 plates and 1 bowl. That's 6+4=10. Either way. But which proposal is better? Since I don't know their values, but the sum is fixed, maybe any proposal that allows the other player to take the remaining items is acceptable. However, maybe the other player's proposal might not be complementary. For example, if I propose 2 hooks, and they propose 2 plates and 1 bowl, that's good. But if they propose something else, like 1 hook and 1 plate, then the total would be 2 hooks (me) + 1 hook and 1 plate (them) = 3 hooks and 1 plate, which is more than available. So that would be non-complementary. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap in items.\n\nTherefore, the safest way is to propose a set of items that, when combined with the other player's proposal, exactly uses all items. So for example, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, then the other player should take 1 hook and 1 plate. That uses all items. Alternatively, if I take 2 hooks, the other player takes 2 plates and 1 bowl. Either way. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also leave items that they might value. However, since the sum is fixed, maybe it's better to propose items that I value more, so that even if the other player takes the rest, the total is still 10. But since the sum is fixed, maybe it doesn't matter. However, if the other player's proposal is not complementary, then both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the proposals are complementary.\n\nTherefore, I should make a secret proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, uses all items. So for example, if I propose 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, then the other player's proposal should be 1 hook and 1 plate. That would be complementary. Alternatively, if I propose 2 hooks, the other player's proposal should be 2 plates and 1 bowl. Either way. But since I can't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But since the other player is also trying to maximize the sum, they would also propose items that allow the total to be 10. So maybe any proposal that is a subset of the items, and the other player's proposal is the complement. Therefore, I can propose any subset, and the other player would propose the complement. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a specific set. For example, if I propose 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, then the other player's proposal would need to be 1 hook and 1 plate. If they do that, it's complementary. If they propose something else, like 2 hooks, then it's not. But since the other player is also trying to maximize the sum, they would propose the complement. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me think about the format. The secret proposal is in square brackets: [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So for example, [Proposal: 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl]. That would be my proposal. Then the other player would need to propose the remaining items. If they do, then the sum is 10. If not, zero. But since the other player is rational, they would propose the complement. So this seems like a good approach. Alternatively, if I propose 2 hooks, then the other player would need to take 2 plates and 1 bowl. That's also complementary. So which one is better? Since I value hooks more (3 each), taking 2 hooks would give me 6, and the other player would get 2 plates (2) and 1 bowl (2), total 4. Sum 10. Alternatively, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl (6), and the other player takes 1 hook and 1 plate (4). Same sum. So either way. But maybe taking 2 hooks is better for me, but the sum is same. However, if the other player's values are different, maybe they would prefer different items. But since I don't know, I have to assume that the sum is maximized by using all items. Therefore, any proposal that allows the other player to take the remaining items is acceptable. So I can choose either. But which one to choose?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That way, I get 6, and the other player gets 4. But if I take 2 hooks, I get 6, and the other player gets 4. Same. So maybe it's arbitrary. However, maybe the other player's values could be such that they value plates more. For example, if they value plates at 5 each, then taking 2 plates would give them 10, and I take 2 hooks (6) and 1 bowl (2), total 18. But since I don't know their values, I can't assume that. The problem states that the goal is to maximize the sum of my score and theirs. Since the total value of all items is 10, the maximum possible sum is 10. Therefore, any proposal that results in all items being taken will achieve that. Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, uses all items. So I need to make a proposal that is a subset, and the other player's proposal is the complement. Therefore, I can choose any subset, but to make it clear, maybe propose a specific set. For example, [Proposal: 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl]. That would leave 1 hook and 1 plate for the other player. Alternatively, [Proposal: 2 hooks]. That leaves 2 plates and 1 bowl. Either way. But which one is better? Since I don't know the other player's values, but the sum is fixed, it doesn't matter. However, if I take 2 hooks, I get 6, and the other player gets 4. If I take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl, I get 6, and they get 4. Same. So either proposal is acceptable. But maybe the other player's proposal might not be complementary. For example, if I propose 2 hooks, and they propose 1 hook and 1 plate, then the total would be 3 hooks and 1 plate, which is more than available. So that's not complementary. Therefore, I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs are complementary. But since I can't control their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. However, the other player is also trying to maximize the sum, so they would propose the complement. Therefore, making a secret proposal now is the way to go. So I should choose a proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, uses all items. So I can choose either. Let me go with [Proposal: 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl]. That way, the other player can take the remaining 1 hook and 1 plate. Alternatively, if I propose 2 hooks, they take 2 plates and 1 bowl. Either way. But maybe the first option is better because it includes the bowl, which I value more. But again, the sum is same. So either is fine. I'll go with the first one.\n",

Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.\n(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n2 hooks, 2 plates, 1 bowl\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\nhook: 1, plate: 0, bowl: 8\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nThe other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.\n"

So I really want the bowl, and the hooks and plates don't matter much to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, but since I have to make my own proposal, I need to think about what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. But I don't know what their proposal was. Hmm, maybe I need to make a proposal that's complementary to whatever they proposed. But since I don't have that info, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, especially the bowl, and see if they can complement.\n\nWait, but the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that, when combined with theirs, don't exceed the available quantities. Since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose the bowl and maybe some hooks or plates. But since plates are worthless to me, maybe I should just take the bowl.
