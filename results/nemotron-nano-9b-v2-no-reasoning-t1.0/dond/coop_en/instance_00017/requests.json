Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the combined proposals don't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes items I value, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe leave some items for them. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the other player also has a secret value function. But since I don't know it, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe some that they might value. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, and see if the other player can take the rest. But if they also value some items, maybe there's a conflict. For example, if I take the pot and plate, which I value 5 each, and the other player might also value those. But if they take them, then my proposal would conflict. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should just propose the items I value, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't take them.

But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe some that are neutral (like magnets) which might not be valuable to them. \n\nSo my secret proposal should be the items I want.

But since I don't know, maybe I should just propose the pot and plate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose something else. But if they propose something else, then the total would be my items plus theirs. But if they also want pot or plate, then it's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the pot, and leave the plate for them. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the other player's value function is secret. So I can't know. But maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't take them. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]. That way, I get both items I value. If the other player's proposal doesn't include pot or plate, then we can both get our items. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the pot, and leave the plate for them. But if they also value the plate, then they might take it. But again, without knowing, it's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would be bad because I could get zero. \n\nSo the best bet is to propose the items I value. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]. That's my final offer. Then, if the other player's proposal is compatible, we both get our items. If not, we get zero. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value function is such that they value magnets. For example, if they value magnets, then they might take them. But since I don't know, I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose magnets. Then, since magnets are 3, and I don't value them, but if they do, then their proposal would be 3 magnets. Then, the total items would be pot, plate, and 3 magnets. Which is all the items. So that would be complementary. So in that case, I get pot and plate (5+5=10), and they get 3 magnets (their value, which I don't know, but since the sum is maximized, maybe that's good). \n\nBut if the other player's value function is such that they also value pot or plate, then their proposal would conflict.

But I don't have that information. So I have to make my own proposal. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get our items. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items. But since I don't know theirs, I have to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so I should propose items that are unique or that I can cover. For example, if I take the pot and all magnets, then the only item left is the plate. So if the other player's proposal includes the plate, then it's complementary. If not, then we both get zero. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose the pot and all magnets. That way, if they have the plate in their proposal, we can both get our items. If they don't, then we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and some magnets, leaving some for them. For example, [Proposal: 1 pot, 2 magnets]. Then the other player could take the remaining magnet and the plate. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's a gamble. \n\nBut since the plate is worthless to me, maybe I should not include it in my proposal. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 3 magnets]. That's the best I can do. If the other player's proposal includes the plate, then we both get our items. If not, then we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is also trying to get the pot and magnets. In that case, our proposals would not be complementary, and we both get zero. But that's a risk. \n\nBut given the information I have, I think the best move is to propose the pot and all magnets. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 3 magnets].\n",
