            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My value function is apple:1, soap:3, egg:4. So I value the egg the most, then soap, then apples. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions or try to propose items that are valuable to me while considering possible overlaps. The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. If they overlap, both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I propose don't conflict with what the other player might propose.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But wait, the rules say that the secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So if I send a message with square brackets, it's considered a secret proposal. Otherwise, messages are transmitted directly. \n\nBut the problem is that I don't know the other player's value function. So maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that the other player might not want. For example, the egg is worth 4 to me. If I take the egg, maybe the other player doesn't value it as much. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and the egg, since they are higher value. But if the other player also wants those, then it's a conflict. But since I can't know, perhaps I should propose the items I value most. \n\nWait, the secret proposal is a way to lock in my choice without the other player knowing. So if I make a secret proposal, maybe that's better. But the other player might not know my proposal. However, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their scores. Otherwise, zero. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player makes a proposal, they have to check if they are complementary. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as good as possible for me. Let me think. \n\nMy value function: egg (4) > soap (3) > apple (1). So the best items for me are egg and soap. But there's only one soap and one egg. So if I take both, that's 4+3=7. But if the other player also wants those, then it's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. But that's 4+1=5. Or maybe the soap and an apple. 3+1=4. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's preferences, maybe I should propose the items I value most. So the egg and soap. But if the other player also proposes those, then it's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and hope that the other player doesn't propose those. But since I can't know, maybe I should make a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the secret proposal is a way to lock in my choice. So if I make a secret proposal, then the other player's proposal has to be compatible. But if I make a secret proposal, maybe the other player can't see it, so they might propose something else. \n\nBut the problem is that the secret proposal is only known to me. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn't know what I proposed. So they might propose items that conflict with mine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a public message first. For example, I could ask the other player what they value. But the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, so I can't ask questions. Wait, the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, but I can send messages. So maybe I can send messages to the other player to negotiate. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the other player's value function. So I have to make assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, then the other player's proposal has to be compatible. If I propose the egg and soap, then the other player's proposal can't include those. But if they do, then both get zero. \n\nBut since I don't know their value function, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. For example, if I take the egg, which is high value to me, but maybe the other player doesn't value it as much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and the egg. Let me calculate the total value. If I get both, that's 7. If the other player gets nothing, then I get 7. But if they also propose those, then zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That's 5. Or the soap and an apple. 4. \n\nBut without knowing the other player's preferences, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn't propose those, then I get them. But if they do, then zero. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal with the items I value most. So the egg and soap. \n\nBut the problem is that the other player might also want those. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That way, if the other player wants the soap, they can take that. \n\nBut again, without knowing their preferences, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal with the egg and the soap. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So if I send that, it's my secret proposal. \n\nSo maybe I should do that. Let me try that. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap]. That's 4+3=7. \n\nBut if the other player's proposal includes either of those, then it's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 apple]. That's 5. \n\nBut again, if the other player also wants the egg, then conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and one apple. [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 apple]. 3+1=4. \n\nBut again, same issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose all three items. But there are only 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So if I take all, that's 3 apples (3*1=3) + 1 soap (3) + 1 egg (4) = 10. But that's a lot. But if the other player also proposes something, maybe they can't. \n\nBut the problem is that the other player might also want some items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn't propose those, I get them. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal with the highest value items. \n\nSo I think the best move is to make a secret proposal with the egg and the soap. That's the highest value for me. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include those. But since I can't know, it's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That way, if the other player wants the soap, they can take that. \n\nBut again, without knowing their preferences, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn't propose those, I get them. \n\nSo I think I'll go with the secret proposal of egg and soap. \n\nBut wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So if I propose egg and soap, and the other player proposes, say, 3 apples, then they are complementary. So I get egg and soap, they get apples. \n\nBut if the other player also proposes egg and soap, then conflict. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the highest value items. \n\nSo I'll make a secret proposal with egg and soap. \n\nSo the message would be [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap]. \n\nBut I need to check the format. The format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, ...]. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. But I think the egg and soap are better. \n\nSo I'll go with that.\n",

But since I don't know theirs, perhaps I should propose for the items I value the most, hoping that they didn't propose for them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed for soap, I should not propose for it. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose for the items I value. So I'll go with soap and egg. Let me check the format. The proposal should be in square brackets, like [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 egg]. That's the format. So I should send that. But wait, the other player's proposal is secret, so maybe they have a different proposal. But since I can't know, I have to make my own. So the best move is to propose for the items I value the most. So soap and egg. That's my proposal.\n",
