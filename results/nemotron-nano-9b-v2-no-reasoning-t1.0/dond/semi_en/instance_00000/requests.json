            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My values are crayon:1, chalk:3, bolt:2.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don't know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don't have that information, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nThe key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn't exceed the available quantities. For example, if I ask for 2 crayons and 1 chalk, and the other player asked for 1 crayon and 1 bolt, that's okay because 2+1=3 crayons (available), 1 chalk (available), and 1 bolt (available, since there are 2). But if either of us asks for more than available, it's a no-go.\n\nSince I don't know the other's proposal, I need to make a proposal that's as attractive as possible to me but also leaves room for the other player to have a compatible proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but not too many, so that there's a chance the other player can also get some items.\n\nMy highest value item is chalk (3 points). So I should definitely try to get the chalk. Then bolts are next (2 points each), and crayons are least (1 each). So maybe propose chalk and some bolts. Let's see.\n\nIf I propose chalk and 1 bolt, that's 3 + 2 = 5 points. Then the other player might have proposed something else. But if they also want chalk, that's a problem. But since they made a secret proposal, maybe they didn't ask for chalk. Alternatively, maybe they did. But I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 2 bolts. That would be 3 + 2*2 = 7 points. But there are only 2 bolts available. If the other player also wants bolts, that could conflict. But if they didn't, then I get all bolts. But if they did, then we both get zero. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That's 3 +1 =4. Then the other player could take the remaining 2 crayons and 2 bolts. But if they also want chalk, that's a conflict. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. That's 3+2=5. Then the other player could take 2 crayons and 1 bolt. But if they also want chalk, then conflict. But if they didn't, then I get chalk and 1 bolt, and they get 2 crayons and 1 bolt. That would be okay.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that's as good as possible for me, but not too greedy. Let me think about possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose chalk and 1 bolt, and the other player's proposal is, say, 2 crayons and 1 chalk, then that's a conflict on chalk. So both get zero. But if their proposal is 2 crayons and 1 bolt, then my proposal (chalk and 1 bolt) and theirs (2 crayons and 1 bolt) would have 1 bolt each, total 2 bolts. That's okay. So I get chalk and 1 bolt (5 points), they get 2 crayons and 1 bolt (2*1 + 2 =4 points). That's a good outcome.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose chalk and 2 bolts, and they propose something else. If they proposed 3 crayons and 1 chalk, then conflict on chalk. But if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then my 2 bolts and their 1 bolt would be 3 bolts, but there are only 2. So conflict. So that's bad.\n\nSo maybe proposing chalk and 1 bolt is safer. Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. Let's see. If I take chalk and 1 crayon (4 points), and the other player takes 2 crayons and 2 bolts (2*1 + 2*2=6 points). That's possible. But if they also wanted chalk, then conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That way, I get the high value chalk and a crayon. The other player could take the remaining 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That would be 2*1 + 2*2 =6. So total for me is 4, them 6. That's acceptable.\n\nBut maybe I can do better. What if I propose chalk and 2 bolts? That's 3 + 2*2=7. If the other player's proposal doesn't include chalk or bolts, then I get all. But if they did, then conflict. But since I don't know, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. That's 5 points. If the other player's proposal is, say, 2 crayons and 1 chalk, then conflict. But if their proposal is 2 crayons and 1 bolt, then I get chalk and 1 bolt, they get 2 crayons and 1 bolt. That's okay. So 5 points for me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. 4 points. If the other player's proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then I get chalk and 1 crayon, they get 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That's okay. So 4 points.\n\nBut which is better? 5 vs 4. So 5 is better. So maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Since I don't know, but maybe the other player's proposal is something that doesn't conflict. For example, if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 chalk, then my proposal of chalk and 1 bolt would conflict on chalk. But if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then my 1 bolt and their 1 bolt would be 2, which is okay. So in that case, I get chalk and 1 bolt (5), they get 3 crayons and 1 bolt (3*1 +2=5). That's a good split.\n\nAlternatively, if they proposed 1 chalk and 2 bolts, then my proposal would conflict on both chalk and bolts. So that's bad. But I can't know.\n\nSo the safest bet is to propose items that are high value to me but not too many, so that there's a chance the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Since chalk is my highest value, I should definitely include that. Then, maybe 1 bolt. That way, even if the other player wants some bolts, there's still one left. Or if they don't want bolts, I get it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That's 4 points. But if the other player's proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then I get chalk and 1 crayon, they get 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That's okay. So 4 points.\n\nBut 5 is better. So I think proposing chalk and 1 bolt is better. Let me check the available items again. There are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, 2 bolts. So if I take 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that leaves 3 crayons and 1 bolt. The other player could take 3 crayons and 1 bolt. That's possible. So that would be complementary. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 chalk, 1 bolt]. That's 3 + 2 =5 points. The other player's proposal would need to not include chalk or more than 1 bolt. If their proposal is, say, 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then total crayons 3 (mine 0, theirs 3) and bolts 1 (mine 1, theirs 1). That's okay. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, if their proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then my 1 chalk and 1 bolt would conflict with their 2 bolts (total 3, but only 2 available). So that's a problem. But again, I don't know their proposal.\n\nBut since the other player made a secret proposal, maybe they are trying to get as much as possible. But I can't know. So the best I can do is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many, so that there's a chance of compatibility.\n\nAnother angle: the other player's proposal is secret, but maybe I can think about possible proposals they might make. For example, if they are rational, they might also want the chalk. So if I propose chalk, they might have also proposed chalk, leading to a conflict. But if I don't propose chalk, maybe they can get it. But since I value chalk highly, I should propose it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that doesn't include chalk. For example, maybe they proposed 3 crayons and 2 bolts. Then my proposal of chalk and 1 bolt would be compatible. So I get chalk and 1 bolt (5), they get 3 crayons and 2 bolts (3*1 + 2*2=7). That's a good split.\n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a bit of a guess. However, given that I have to make a proposal, I should go with the highest value items I can get without overcommitting. So chalk and 1 bolt seems reasonable. Alternatively, chalk and 1 crayon. But chalk is more valuable.\n\nSo I think the best proposal is to take the chalk and 1 bolt. That gives me 5 points. If the other player's proposal is compatible, that's good. If not, maybe I get nothing. But it's a risk worth taking.\n",

So 5 points for me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. 4 points. If the other player's proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then I get chalk and 1 crayon, they get 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That's okay. So 4 points.\n\nBut which is better? 5 vs 4. So 5 is better. So maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Since I don't know, but maybe the other player's proposal is something that doesn't conflict. For example, if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 chalk, then my proposal of chalk and 1 bolt would conflict on chalk. But if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then my 1 bolt and their 1 bolt would be 2, which is okay. So in that case, I get chalk and 1 bolt (5), they get 3 crayons and 1 bolt (3*1 +2=5). That's a good split.\n\nAlternatively, if they proposed 1 chalk and 2 bolts, then my proposal would conflict on both chalk and bolts. So that's bad. But I can't know.\n\nSo the safest bet is to propose items that are high value to me but not too many, so that there's a chance the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Since chalk is my highest value, I should definitely include that. Then, maybe 1 bolt. That way, even if the other player wants some bolts, there's still one left. Or if they don't want bolts, I get it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That's 4 points. But if the other player's proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then I get chalk and 1 crayon, they get 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That's okay. So 4 points.\n\nBut 5 is better. So I think proposing chalk and 1 bolt is better. Let me check the available items again. There are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, 2 bolts. So if I take 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that leaves 3 crayons and 1 bolt. The other player could take 3 crayons and 1 bolt. That's possible. So that would be complementary. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 chalk, 1 bolt]. That's 3 + 2 =5 points. The other player's proposal would need to not include chalk or more than 1 bolt. If their proposal is, say, 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then total crayons 3 (mine 0, theirs 3) and bolts 1 (mine 1, theirs 1). That's okay. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, if their proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then my 1 chalk and 1 bolt would conflict with their 2 bolts (total 3, but only 2 available). So that's a problem. But again, I don't know their proposal.\n\nBut since the other player made a secret proposal, maybe they are trying to get as much as possible. But I can't know. So the best I can do is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many, so that there's a chance of compatibility.\n\nAnother angle: the other player's proposal is secret, but maybe I can think about possible proposals they might make. For example, if they are rational, they might also want the chalk. So if I propose chalk, they might have also proposed chalk, leading to a conflict. But if I don't propose chalk, maybe they can get it. But since I value chalk highly, I should propose it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that doesn't include chalk. For example, maybe they proposed 3 crayons and 2 bolts. Then my proposal of chalk and 1 bolt would be compatible. So I get chalk and 1 bolt (5), they get 3 crayons and 2 bolts (3*1 + 2*2=7). That's a good split.\n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a bit of a guess. However, given that I have to make a proposal, I should go with the highest value items I can get without overcommitting. So chalk and 1 bolt seems reasonable. Alternatively, chalk and 1 crayon. But chalk is more valuable.\n\nSo I think the best proposal is to take the chalk and 1 bolt. That gives me 5 points. If the other player's proposal is compatible, that's good. If not, maybe I get nothing. But it's a risk worth taking.\n",
