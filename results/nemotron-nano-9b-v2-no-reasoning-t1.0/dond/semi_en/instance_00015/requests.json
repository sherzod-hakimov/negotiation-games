So I really want the bowl and bottle, and the fruits and eraser don't matter to me. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my chances of getting the items I value. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores based on their values.

But the problem says I can send up to 5 messages or terminate early with a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the secret proposal is formatted as \"[Proposal: ...]\". So if I send that, the other player will see it, but I can't communicate anything else. Alternatively, I can send regular messages, but they have to be in the format without square brackets. \n\nBut the user is asking me to start the negotiation.

So if I propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes something else, maybe we can agree. But if they also want those, then we might have a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose to take the bowl and bottle, and offer the fruits and eraser to the other player. Since the fruits and eraser are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. If I propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, then we can both get our items. \n\nAlternatively, if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can get the items I want without the other player knowing. But the problem says that the secret proposal is made at any time, and if it's complementary, then both get their items. \n\nWait, the secret proposal is a way to propose without the other player knowing until they accept. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then each is awarded based on their items. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player's proposal (whether secret or not) is compatible, then we both get our items. \n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal once, maybe I should do that. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of taking the bowl and bottle, then the other player might make a proposal that doesn't conflict. For example, if they take the fruits and eraser, then we can both get our items. \n\nBut if the other player also wants the bowl or bottle, then their proposal would conflict, and we both get zero. So maybe I should make a secret proposal to take the bowl and bottle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should first send a regular message to the other player, suggesting that I want the bowl and bottle, and offer the fruits and eraser. But since I can't use square brackets in regular messages, I have to phrase it as a regular message. \n\nBut the user is the one who is supposed to start. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. \n\nThe secret proposal is formatted as \"[Proposal: ...]\". So if I send that, the other player will see it.

Let me know if you want those.\" But since I can't use square brackets, I have to phrase it as a regular message. \n\nBut the user is supposed to make a secret proposal. Wait, the instructions say that the user can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal immediately. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be to take the bowl and bottle. The other player's proposal would need to not take those items. If they take the fruits and eraser, then we can both get our items. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe they might also want the bowl or bottle. However, since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player might propose something else.

For example, \"I'm willing to take the bowl and bottle.
