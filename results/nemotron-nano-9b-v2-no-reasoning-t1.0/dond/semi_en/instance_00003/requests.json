Since I don't know, maybe the safest way is to propose the hat and some pens. But I need to make sure that my proposal is as valuable as possible. Since the hat is the highest value, I should include it. So I'll go with [Proposal: 1 hat, 3 pens]. That's 4 + 3*2 = 10. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the hat, then I get 10. If they do, then zero. But maybe that's the best I can do. Alternatively, if I propose only the hat, then if they didn't take it, I get 4. But 10 is better. So I think proposing the hat and all pens is the way to go.\n",
