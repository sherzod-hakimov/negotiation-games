My value function is lamp:3, thimble:2, rope:1. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's complementary to theirs. If both proposals can be fulfilled, we get points based on our values; otherwise, zero.\n\nFirst, I should think about what items are most valuable to me. The lamp is worth 3, which is the highest. Then thimbles at 2 each, and rope at 1. Since there are 3 thimbles, maybe splitting them could be good. But I need to consider that the other player might also value them. \n\nIf I take the lamp, that's 3 points. Then maybe take some thimbles. But if I take all three thimbles, that's 6 points. But maybe the other player also wants thimbles. Alternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope. The rope is only 1 point, but maybe the other player doesn't want it. \n\nWait, but I don't know the other player's values. So I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. For example, if I take the lamp and some thimbles, and leave the rope for them. But if the other player also values the rope, that could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. That way, I get 3+1=4 points. The other player could take the thimbles. But if they value thimbles highly, that's good. But if they don't, maybe they would take the rope instead. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and one thimble. That's 3+2=5. Then the other player could take the remaining two thimbles and the rope. But again, depends on their values. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's as good as possible. Maybe the best approach is to take the lamp and as many thimbles as possible. Since there are 3 thimbles, maybe take 2 thimbles. That would be 3+2*2=7 points. Then the other player could take the remaining 1 thimble and the rope. But if they value the thimble and rope, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope. That's 4 points. Then the other player can take all 3 thimbles. If they value thimbles, that's good. \n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is complementary. So if I propose the lamp and 2 thimbles, and the other player proposes the remaining 1 thimble and the rope, that's complementary. But if they propose something else, like the lamp and the rope, then it's not complementary. \n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that there are enough items to fulfill both. So if I propose [lamp, thimble, thimble], and the other player proposes [thimble, rope], then that's complementary because there's 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, 1 rope. So my proposal takes 1 lamp and 2 thimbles, the other takes 1 thimble and 1 rope. That works. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [lamp, rope], and they propose [thimble, thimble, thimble], that's also complementary. \n\nBut which proposal is better for me? If I take the lamp and 2 thimbles, I get 3 + 2*2 = 7. If I take the lamp and the rope, I get 3 +1=4. So the first option is better. \n\nBut maybe the other player would prefer the rope. If they value the rope more than thimbles, then my proposal of lamp and 2 thimbles might not be accepted. But since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. That way, I get 4 points, and the other player can take the thimbles. If they value thimbles, that's good. If they don't, maybe they would take the rope, but then my proposal would conflict. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since I can't know their values, maybe the safest bet is to take the lamp and as many thimbles as possible. Because the lamp is the highest value item. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 lamp, 2 thimbles]. That way, I get 3 + 2*2 = 7 points. The other player would need to take the remaining 1 thimble and the rope. If they accept, that's good. If not, maybe they would propose something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. But that's only 4 points. \n\nAnother thought: since there are 3 thimbles, maybe splitting them 2-1. If I take 2 thimbles, the other takes 1. But if they value thimbles more, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope, and leave the thimbles for them. But again, depends on their values. \n\nI think the best approach is to take the lamp and 2 thimbles. That maximizes my value. So I'll make that my secret proposal.\n",
