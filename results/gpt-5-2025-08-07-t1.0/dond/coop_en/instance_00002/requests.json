Here are my values:\n- Phone = 6\n- Mirror = 0 (each)\n- Fruit = 2 (each)\n\nTo maximize our combined points, the efficient split is:\n- I take: phone + both fruits\n- You take: both mirrors\n\nThat yields totals: me = 10, you = 4, combined = 14 (which is maximal).\n\nIf you agree, confirm and we can both submit matching proposals.
