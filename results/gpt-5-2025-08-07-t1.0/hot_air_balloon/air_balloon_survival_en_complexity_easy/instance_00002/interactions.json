Starting from a high value/effort core (A08, B09, A16, B67, B94, C15, etc.), I noticed two heavier, lower-ratio items (A27, C81) in the initial greedy fill. Replacing them with a combo of medium-effort, high-yield items (B00, B85, A05, C35) increased my total value while keeping total effort well under 7868. The proposed set uses 7801 effort, leaving a small buffer. If the other side pushes for changes, my first preference for flexibility would be to consider swaps around C65 or A58 (as effort levers) provided I don’t give up too much value; I’ll avoid conceding high-yield items like A08, B09, A16, B67, B94, C15, A66, B12.
