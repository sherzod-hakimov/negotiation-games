	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Capacity 9612. I computed value/effort ratios and built a near-knapsack-optimal bundle maximizing my utility. Core high-ROI anchors for me: A16, A27, A30, B60, B67, B09, B10, A66, A08, B12, C15, C81, C70, plus efficient small items (B69, B45). Then I filled remaining space with solid-value items (C12, B94, B46) and small fillers (C24, C06) to use capacity. Total effort 9551, leaving 61 slack. This set has very high total importance for me. For concessions, I’m most flexible on low-impact fillers like C06, C24, B75, and possibly reshuffling one mid-tier if needed, but I will strongly defend the core anchors listed. If the other side asks for swaps, I’ll seek to trade out weaker items for any of their must-haves while keeping my high-value anchors intact. If they propose something very different, I’ll refuse and counter with targeted swaps. I won’t reveal my scores, only argue efficiency and balance.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'B69', 'A30', 'A27', 'A16', 'A58', 'B45', 'B60', 'B75', 'B10', 'B09', 'B67', 'C70', 'A66', 'A08', 'B12', 'C15', 'C81', 'C12', 'B94', 'B46', 'C24', 'C06'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This selection uses the limit efficiently (total effort 9551 ≤ 9612) by prioritizing items with strong benefit for the effort and rounding out with a few small, low-effort pieces to stay near capacity. I’m open to swaps if you have must-haves not included—especially trading around the smaller fillers—so long as we keep within the limit. Which items are most important to you?'}
