Total for this 10-item set is 3,280 effort with importance 6,395 (by my scores), which appears near-optimal. Concession plan: the softest item for me is C08 (329 effort); if needed, I can swap it (e.g., for C43) to accommodate a priority of theirs with minimal loss. I will resist adding very high-effort/low-yield-for-me items (A62, B19, C73) unless compensated by multiple swaps because they displace several high-value picks.
