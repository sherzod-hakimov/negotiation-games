I computed value/effort ratios and built a near-optimal knapsack by excluding the lowest-efficiency high-effort items until the included set fits the limit. I excluded: B43, B64, B81, A94, A96, C60, A88, B95, C10, A97, C83, C84 (total excluded effort 10416), leaving included effort 9730 (slack 343). I verified that no single swap of small included items would make room for any excluded item without reducing my total importance. My included set yields total importance 12007 for 9730 effort. I will propose this as a strong opening while signaling flexibility to swap one or two mid-tier items if the other side has must-haves.'}\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A08', 'A39', 'A65', 'B34', 'A28', 'C82', 'B69', 'A87', 'B15', 'C79', 'B16', 'C53', 'A25', 'A71', 'B23', 'B96', 'C51', 'C17', 'B19', 'C72', 'A46', 'B37', 'A75'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'This set stays within the shared effort limit and prioritizes items that deliver strong benefit relative to their effort. I avoided several very effort-heavy, lower-efficiency items to keep room for a broad, balanced selection. If you have one or two must-have items from those excluded, tell me which, and I can consider swapping out one or two mid-tier items to fit them in while keeping within the limit.'}"
