	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Limit 9322. I computed a high-efficiency bundle via ratio-based selection, then locally optimized with small swaps that increased total value without breaching the limit. Starting from a greedy set, I improved it by: B16->A97 (+17 v, +17 e), B64->C60 (+40 v, +40 e), A88->B19 (+34 v, +34 e), and A28->B64 (+93 v, +93 e). Final set uses 9267 effort (55 spare) and yields high total value for me. I’ll anchor with this strong package while signaling flexibility: I can consider one-for-one swaps with similar effort or a larger trade if they strongly want a heavy item, but I’ll ask them to name top must-haves. I won’t reveal my scores publicly and will justify by efficiency and workload balance.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A25', 'A71', 'C17', 'B69', 'A39', 'B96', 'A08', 'C84', 'B43', 'C79', 'A46', 'C10', 'C53', 'A94', 'C60', 'B95', 'A65', 'C72', 'B19', 'A97', 'B15', 'B64', 'C82'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This package keeps total effort comfortably under the limit while prioritizing efficient, lower-effort items that deliver strong overall benefit. It also spans a broad mix across A/B/C items and even leaves a small buffer (~55 effort) to accommodate minor adjustments. If you have 1–2 must-have items not included here, suggest them and we can consider targeted one-for-one swaps of similar effort to keep us within the limit. If you prefer adding a heavier item, we can discuss which multiple smaller items would need to be traded out to fit it while keeping the workload feasible.'}

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Their offer is already efficient and close to the limit (9267/9322) while favoring low-to-mid effort items. I computed my utility and explored swaps that increase my value without breaching the cap. Heavy items (e.g., B81, B34, B37, A87, C83, etc.) have poorer effort/value ratios relative to items in their set, so direct additions would likely reduce my total value. The best improvements come from targeted one-for-one swaps that use the remaining buffer efficiently. The strongest combo within the 55 buffer is swapping in A28, B16, and A88 for C82, B19, and C79 respectively. This uses +54 effort (ending at 9321) and increases my total value by the same margin, without shifting the structure too much.

From my perspective, these three substitutions deliver stronger impact for comparable effort, keeping the overall mix and workload stable.
