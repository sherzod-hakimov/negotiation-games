You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\n\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\n\n\nYou will now receive the first message of the other player.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B96', 'A60', 'B20', 'B09', 'B31', 'B93', 'A82', 'C08', 'A11', 'C85'}\nARGUMENT: {'This set keeps total effort at 2783, well under the limit, and focuses on efficient, medium-effort items while avoiding very heavy or low-yield options. If B33 is a must for you, I can swap out C08 and C85 for B33 and stay within the limit. If B21 is critical, I can swap A11 for B21 and still remain within the limit. Let me know your top priorities or any items you strongly want to exclude.'}"

I kept the efficient core you proposed and made three changes: (1) replaced A11 and C08 with A21 and B39—similar effort but better overall balance; (2) swapped B31 for a single heavier C81 while still staying well under the limit; and (3) retained C85 and the other light, efficient picks.

I can’t accept C81, A21, or B39—they’re low return for me. I’m adopting your offer to use B31 instead of C81 and, as a concession, I’m leaving out the heavier A11 entirely. In exchange, I need C08 and B33, which deliver strong impact per effort for me. This set totals 2904 (≤ 2984). If B33 is hard for you, I can swap B33 for A11 while staying within the limit; if C08 is the sticking point, I can switch C08 to A11 and drop C85 to remain under the cap.
