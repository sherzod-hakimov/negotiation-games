It makes one efficiency upgrade A21→B33 to boost overall value and still stays lean: total effort = 3587 (≤ 3683). If you must keep A21, I can swap it in for B33 (effort becomes 3618). Alternatively, if you prefer B96 over A82, I can swap A82→B96 (effort becomes 3633). Tell me which version you want and we can finalize immediately.\"}"
