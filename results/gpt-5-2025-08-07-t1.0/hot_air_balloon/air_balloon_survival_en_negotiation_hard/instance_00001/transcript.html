        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Maximizing my value calls for a near-optimal knapsack. Item efficiencies (importance per effort) make B35, A10, C00, A87, B86, B32, C01, and B41 collectively very strong, totaling 4021 effort (≤ 4026) with high combined value for me. I tested swaps: adding C54 instead of B41 plus A77 only drops my value slightly (-10), so that’s an easy concession if they want C54. If they push for A71, exchanging it for B41+A87 keeps us under limit (3957 effort) at a meaningful but acceptable value drop for me, so that can be a later concession. I’ll open with my best set and signal flexibility around C54 (+A77) or A71 (for B41+A87), while resisting low-efficiency items for me like A04, A03, B33, C17 unless they offer substantial trade-offs.&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;This selection uses 4021/4026 effort and packs in several efficient items while keeping variety across categories.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;My values (hidden) make A77, A04, A03, A87, C17, B33, B32, C54, and B35 extremely attractive. I computed capacities and found a high-importance set at 3941/4026 effort with total personal value 6082, better than any alternatives I tested. Opponent’s offer gives me relatively low value and includes heavy, low-yield items for me (C01, B41). I’ll refuse and anchor with my best bundle, while offering a clear, minimal-cost path to accommodate one of their likely must-haves (B41) by swapping out C54 and B35. If they push for both B41 and B86, I have a fallback that stays within limit by dropping B32 as well; that still keeps my value high. I will not reveal my scores, only emphasize efficiency and feasibility.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;Thanks for the flexible start. I suggest this set using 3941/4026 effort. It keeps a strong mix across categories with very efficient items, leaving a small buffer for safety. If B41 is important to you, I can accommodate it by swapping out C54 (587) and B35 (140) for B41 (742); that variant uses 3956 effort and keeps the rest intact. If you have another specific must-have, say so and we can make a small trade to fit it while staying under the limit.&quot;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their offer is very weak for me (value 3211) because it includes several low-value-to-me items (C17, A04, A03) and excludes multiple of my top picks. My best set is the 4021-effort bundle I opened with (value 5389). To move toward agreement without sacrificing much, I’ll counter with my preplanned concession: swap out B41 for their C54 plus keep A77. That keeps five of their suggested items (A77, A87, B32, B35, C54), stays well under the limit (3943), and preserves almost all my value (5379, just -10 vs my best). I’ll reject their set, propose this compromise, and signal two flexible variants: (1) if they want B41, swap back C54+A77 -&gt; B41; (2) if they really need B33, we can trade C01 -&gt; B33 to fit, though it hurts me more.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their counter keeps five of my favored items. They explicitly offered the option to trade C01 for B33 if B33 is important to me—this is perfect: it gives me a big value boost with minimal disruption and stays far under the limit. To maximize chances of quick agreement, I’ll make exactly that swap and avoid asking for additional changes now. If they push back, my fallbacks are small, single-item trades (e.g., C00-&gt;A03 or A10-&gt;A04), but those may face resistance because they previously flagged A03/A04/C17 as low for them.
