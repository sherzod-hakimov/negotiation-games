My best improvement, within their own “single swap” invitation, is to replace A10 with my top low-effort favorite A77. They previously offered A77 in an earlier package, so it should be palatable. This raises my payoff substantially while keeping their structure and both A87 and A04. We’ll refuse and propose the single-swap variant. As a softer fallback (if they resist A77), I’ll signal A10 -> C54 as another minimal swap, but keep only one official PROPOSAL active.'}\nREFUSE: {'B35', 'B32', 'C00', 'A10', 'A71', 'C01', 'A87', 'A04'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B35', 'B32', 'C00', 'A71', 'C01', 'A87', 'A04', 'A77'}\nARGUMENT: {'You invited a single-item swap—here’s a minimal adjustment that keeps your structure intact (including A71, B35, B32, C00, C01) and retains A87 and A04: replace A10 with A77.
