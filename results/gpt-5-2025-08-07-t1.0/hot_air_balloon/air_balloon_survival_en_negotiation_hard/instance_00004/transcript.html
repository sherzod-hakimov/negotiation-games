        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I computed effort-efficiency (importance per effort) and searched combinations under 5138. The best bundle for my values is {B35, B32, C00, A10, A71, C01, B86} with total effort 5084 and very high total importance to me. I tested swaps: replacing B86 with {B41, A77} is the best near-equivalent concession (slightly worse for me), while dropping any of A71, C00, A10, C01, B35, or B32 to fit others reduces my value notably. If they push for B41 or A87, my next move could be to swap B86 -&gt; {B41, A77} or consider a different single swap while holding the core six items.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Opponent’s package keeps several of my low-value items (A71, C00, A10) that are very costly in effort. My best bundle is {A77, A04, B32, A87, B33, A03, C17, C54} at effort 4854 and value 5820 to me. To increase overlap and appear cooperative, I’ll swap C54 for their C01 and propose {A77, A04, B32, A87, B33, A03, C17, C01} (effort 5093), which still scores very high for me (5701) while adopting one of their “core” items and keeping B32. I will explicitly refuse their current package and argue that my proposal is more effort-efficient and tight to the limit, and invite targeted swaps (e.g., if they need B35 or B86 we can discuss replacing C01/C54/A03/C17), but I will strongly resist adding A71, C00, or A10 due to their heavy effort footprint crowding out my high-impact picks.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your set is close to the limit and well-packed on effort, but several heavy items (A71, C00, A10) force us to drop more efficient picks.

It retains B32 and C01 from your core and stays very close to the limit.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal yields me low value because several inclusions (C17, A03, A04, A77, B33) are weak on my side. My best bundle is the core six {B35, B32, C00, A10, A71, C01} plus one more slot. To bridge, I’ll swap my B86 out and offer {B41, A77} instead, which keeps me very close to my top value while giving them one of their asks (A77) and avoiding their lowest-efficiency (to me) heavy items. I’ll anchor on that and present a clear alternative tailored to their stated interests: swap {B41, A77} for {A87, A04}. Both stay within the limit and include multiple items they wanted while keeping my core intact.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their behavior signals a strong attachment to the six-item core {B35, B32, C00, A10, A71, C01}. Those are low-to-middling for me, especially A71/A10/C00, but to reach agreement I’ll keep most of their core and trade out only the single worst (A71) while loading in my highest-efficiency items that they already hinted they could accept (A87, A04) plus one additional efficient pick (C54) and retain A77. That yields a 9-item bundle at 5097 effort that massively improves my outcome while still honoring 5/6 of their core and both of their suggested adds. I’ll refuse their current offer, anchor on this compromise, and present clear fallbacks: (a) if A71 is truly mandatory, we can drop A77 and C54 to adopt their A71 variant at 5127 (their own suggested alternative), or (b) if B41 is crucial, we can trade in B41 by dropping A77 and C54, preserving their backbone while staying under the limit.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;They’ve locked A71, C00, and B35 as essentials and refused swaps to A77/B41. This package is within the limit (5013) and still includes several of my high-value items (A87, A04, B32, C54). I previously signaled I would accept if B35 was non-negotiable. Given diminishing prospects for further improvements without breaking their red lines, I will accept to secure agreement.&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This set is within the limit and preserves the converged backbone while keeping our most mutually compatible items. It reflects the single-item constraints you stated and aligns with the tight, effort-efficient structure we built together. I’m ready to finalize.&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;}</p>
