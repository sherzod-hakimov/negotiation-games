It keeps the shared backbone (C00, B35, C54, C01, B41, B32, B86), honors the preference to retain B32 and B86, avoids the heaviest outlier, and uses the budget efficiently at 3345/3481 with comfortable slack. If you want a tiny efficiency tweak, I’m open to exploring one while keeping this structure, but this looks ready to lock in.'}"
