        <p>I want to maximize our total score. Could you share your values for carrot, bag, and onion (or at least your preference order and how valuable a bag is to you)? Then I’ll compute the welfare-maximizing split and suggest exact complementary proposals so we both get points.<br/><br/>If you prefer a quick default while we clarify: you choose whichever single vegetable (carrot or onion) you value more, I’ll take the other vegetable, and we split the 4 bags 2–2. If you don’t care about vegetables and value bags highly, say so and you can take all 4 bags while I take both vegetables; if you love vegetables and don’t care about bags, the reverse can work.</p>
