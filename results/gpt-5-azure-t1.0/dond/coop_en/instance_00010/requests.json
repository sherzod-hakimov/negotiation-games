Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nI want to maximize our total score. Here are my values: plier 2 each, chalk 3, nail 2, bucket 1. My priority is chalk > pliers > nail > bucket.\n\nCould you share your values or at least your ranking of these items? Then we can assign each item to whoever values it more.\n\nTentative idea if your values aren’t too different: we each take 1 plier; I take the chalk; you take the nail and the bucket. If you value the chalk more than the nail+bucket, we can swap the chalk for the nail, or adjust based on your preferences."

My ranking: nail > bucket > chalk > plier.\n\nGiven both our values, the efficient split (maximizing total) is:\n- You take: 2 pliers and the chalk (values to you: 2+2+3 = 7)\n- I take: the nail and the bucket (values to me: 5+3 = 8)\nTotal = 15, which is better than the 11 from your tentative split.\n\nIf you agree, please confirm you’ll propose: 2 plier, 1 chalk.\nI will then propose: 1 nail, 1 bucket."
