        <p>I can concede the shovel to you, but the bowl is important to me. How about this: you take the shovel and all three glasses; I take the bowl and both berries. That gives you the shovel you want and every glass, and I get the bowl I need.<br/><br/>If you absolutely must keep the bowl, then I’d need the shovel instead; otherwise your opening split is too low for me. Does my proposal work?</p>
