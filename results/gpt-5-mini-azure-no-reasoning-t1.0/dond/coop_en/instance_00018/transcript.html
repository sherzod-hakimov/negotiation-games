        <p>Hello — let&#x27;s split everything so both of us get full value. There are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes. I value each item equally. I propose we split items so each gets 1 coin? (there&#x27;s only one) Maybe one of us takes the coin plus one potato and the other takes 2 envelopes and one potato, or similar. I prefer an even-value split. What do you think?</p>

        <p>I agree — let&#x27;s make sure all items are allocated so both of us get high total value. Given there are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes, a natural full split is one player takes the coin + 1 potato, the other takes 2 envelopes + 1 potato. That uses everything.<br/><br/>From my values (coin 2, envelope 1, potato 3), that split gives:<br/>- coin + 1 potato = 2 + 3 = 5<br/>- 2 envelopes + 1 potato = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5<br/>Total 10, perfectly even for me.<br/><br/>Would you be okay with that allocation (coin+potato vs. 2 envelopes+potato)? If you prefer a different assignment of which of us gets which bundle, or a swap (e.g., I take the envelopes bundle and you take the coin bundle), tell me and we can finalize.</p>

        <p>That split works perfectly for me. With my values (2 each), coin+potato = 4 and 2 envelopes+potato = 6, total 10 — all items allocated.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t have a preference over who gets which bundle, so let&#x27;s assign as you suggested: you take 2 envelopes + 1 potato, and I&#x27;ll take the coin + 1 potato.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll finalize with my secret proposal now.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 coin, 1 potato]</p>
