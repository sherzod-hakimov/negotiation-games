Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.\n(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\ncoin: 2, envelope: 1, potato: 3\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nHello — let's split everything so both of us get full value. There are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes. I value each item equally. I propose we split items so each gets 1 coin? (there's only one) Maybe one of us takes the coin plus one potato and the other takes 2 envelopes and one potato, or similar. I prefer an even-value split. What do you think?"

Given there are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes, a natural full split is one player takes the coin + 1 potato, the other takes 2 envelopes + 1 potato. That uses everything.\n\nFrom my values (coin 2, envelope 1, potato 3), that split gives:\n- coin + 1 potato = 2 + 3 = 5\n- 2 envelopes + 1 potato = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5\nTotal 10, perfectly even for me.\n\nWould you be okay with that allocation (coin+potato vs. 2 envelopes+potato)? If you prefer a different assignment of which of us gets which bundle, or a swap (e.g., I take the envelopes bundle and you take the coin bundle), tell me and we can finalize."
