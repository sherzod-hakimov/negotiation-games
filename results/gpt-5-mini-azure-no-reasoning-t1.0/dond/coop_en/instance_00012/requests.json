        "content": "You are playing a cooperative negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.\n\nRules:\n(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.\n(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\nruler: 3, egg: 0, battery: 1\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nI value rulers 1 each, eggs 2 each, battery 3. How do you value them? If you tell me values we can split to maximize total. If you prefer not to reveal, I can suggest an allocation that gives each of us high combined value.\n\nA fair high-sum split would be:\n- Give one player the battery (3) and one egg (2) plus one ruler (1) = 6\n- Give the other player one egg (2) and two rulers (2) = 4\nThat uses all items and total value 10.\n\nWould you prefer to take the battery+egg+1 ruler (total 6 for me) or the egg+2 rulers (total 4)? I can take the lower bundle if you need the battery."

        "content": "I value rulers 3 each, eggs 0, battery 1.\n\nYour suggested split (6 vs 4) uses your valuations; with my values those bundles score differently. To maximize total combined value, compute totals under both our valuations:\n\nOption A (battery + 1 egg + 1 ruler) vs (1 egg + 2 rulers)\n- For you: 6 and 4 (as you computed).\n- For me: battery(1)+egg(0)+ruler(3)=4 for A; egg(0)+2*ruler(6)=6 for B.\n- Combined totals: A -> 6+4=10; B -> 4+6=10. Both sum to 10, so either allocation attains the maximum possible total.\n\nSince both options give the same combined total, let's pick one that seems fair. I prefer the bundle with the egg + 2 rulers (your \"lower\" bundle for you) because it gives me slightly higher personal value. So I propose we split as:\n\nYou take: battery + egg + 1 ruler\nMe take: 1 egg + 2 rulers\n\nIf you agree, we can finalize. Otherwise, suggest an alternative and I'll respond."
