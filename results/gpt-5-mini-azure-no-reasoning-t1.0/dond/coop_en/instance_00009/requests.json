I can’t share my exact values, but I’ll say which items matter to me: I care about cards and the picture; cards matter most, the picture somewhat, the bolt and egg don’t matter to me.\n\nGiven that, a straightforward complementary division that gives everything away without conflict would be:\n- You take the bolt and the egg (if you value the egg at all), and\n- I take the picture and all 4 cards.\n\nWould that work for you? If you’d prefer the picture instead, tell me whether you need any cards too and how many, and we can make complementary proposals."
