        <p>You are playing a negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>1 frame, 1 shoe, 3 hammers<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>frame: 8, shoe: 2, hammer: 0<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Thanks — I like to be flexible. I value each item differently but I&#x27;m happy to let you indicate your priorities first. Which of the three items (frame, shoe, hammers) would you most like? If you tell me rough preferences (1st, 2nd, 3rd) I’ll propose a split that tries to give each of us good value.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the offer. I also value the frame most and would prefer to get it, but your proposal gives you the frame and me the shoe plus all three hammers. With my values (frame 6, shoe 1, each hammer 1), that allocation would give you 6 points and me 4 points. I&#x27;m willing to agree to a split that&#x27;s fairer to me.<br/><br/>Counterproposal: you keep the frame; I take the shoe and two hammers (leaving one hammer with you). That gives you 7 points (frame 6 + hammer 1) and me 3 points (shoe 1 + two hammers 2). Are you okay with that, or would you prefer the original proposal?</p>
