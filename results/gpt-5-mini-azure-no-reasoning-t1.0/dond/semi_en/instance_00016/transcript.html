        <p>Thanks — I can work with that. I also value the chair but vases are my next priority. I’ll aim to leave the chair to you if that helps us both score well.<br/><br/>If you want the chair, would you take: chair for you, and I take 3 vases and the wire? That would be chair to you; I’d get all 3 vases + wire. If that’s too many vases for me, tell me a variant (e.g., you take chair and one vase, I take the rest).</p>

        <p>That split works well — I’ll take the chair. If you prefer, we can adjust so you keep fewer vases, but your suggestion is fine. I&#x27;ll make my secret proposal now.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 chair]</p>
