        <p>You are playing a negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, 1 eraser<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>bowl: 5, bottle: 5, fruit: 0, eraser: 0<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Hi — glad to negotiate. Quick check: do you have any strong preference rankings among the items (bowl, bottle, fruits, eraser)? I value bowl and bottle much more than fruits/eraser, so if one of those is important to you I’m open to trading for both fruits or other concessions. Otherwise I’d prefer to take one of the high-value items. What do you most want?</p>

        <p>I can take both fruits and the eraser — that gives me 3+3+3 = 9 points. Either the bowl or the bottle is fine to give you; I value the bowl 1 and the bottle 0, so I&#x27;d prefer you take the bottle (so I keep the bowl), but either works for me.
