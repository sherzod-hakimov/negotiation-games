        "content": "Thanks for the clear proposal. I also value the orange most, so I can't accept giving it up for only a pepper and one picture. How about a small tweak: you take the pepper and two pictures, and I take the orange and one picture — that gives you pepper (3) + 2 pictures (0) = 3, and me orange (7) + 1 picture (0) = 7. If you'd prefer a split that boosts your score more, we could instead do you: pepper + all 3 pictures (3 + 0 = 3) and me: orange (7). That still leaves me at 7 and you at 3, which is fair given our valuations. Which would you prefer?"

Your two suggested splits both leave me worse off than keeping the orange, so I won't accept them.\n\nHere's a proposal that makes me better off while still giving you the orange (since you value it most): you take the orange (1) and I take the pepper and all 3 pictures. That gives me pepper (2) + 3 pictures (3) = 5, and you orange (5). Our scores would be equal at 5 each. Would you accept that?"
