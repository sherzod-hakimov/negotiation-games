Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

        <p>Hi — thanks, nice to negotiate. I like the orange more than the pepper, and pictures are least important to me. If you tell me your preferences (just rank orange, pepper, pictures), we can try to split so each gets what matters more. What do you prefer most?</p>

        <p>I prefer orange most, then pepper, then pictures. Since we both value the orange highest, how about we each take one high-priority item: you take the orange, I&#x27;ll take the pepper, and we split the pictures (there are three) — two to me, one to you. That gives me pepper (2) + 2 pictures (2) = 4, and gives you orange (5) + 1 picture (1) = 6. Does that work for you?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the clear proposal. I also value the orange most, so I can&#x27;t accept giving it up for only a pepper and one picture. How about a small tweak: you take the pepper and two pictures, and I take the orange and one picture — that gives you pepper (3) + 2 pictures (0) = 3, and me orange (7) + 1 picture (0) = 7. If you&#x27;d prefer a split that boosts your score more, we could instead do you: pepper + all 3 pictures (3 + 0 = 3) and me: orange (7). That still leaves me at 7 and you at 3, which is fair given our valuations. Which would you prefer?</p>

        <p>Thanks — I appreciate the offer. I can&#x27;t accept giving up the orange for just a pepper and pictures because the orange is my highest-value item (orange=5 for me). Your two suggested splits both leave me worse off than keeping the orange, so I won&#x27;t accept them.<br/><br/>Here&#x27;s a proposal that makes me better off while still giving you the orange (since you value it most): you take the orange (1) and I take the pepper and all 3 pictures. That gives me pepper (2) + 3 pictures (3) = 5, and you orange (5). Our scores would be equal at 5 each. Would you accept that?</p>
