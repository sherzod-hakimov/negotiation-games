        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other participant has refused my previous proposal and presented a new proposal that includes A27, which is an item that they consider to be highly important. I will analyze this new proposal and determine whether it meets my needs. I notice that the new proposal includes a mix of items that are important to both of us, and it stays within the LIMIT.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other player has proposed the same set that I previously proposed, which suggests that we may be converging on a mutually acceptable solution. I will review the proposal again to ensure that it meets my needs and is within the LIMIT. The total effort of the proposed items is 192 + 46 + 501 + 239 + 515 + 876 + 944 = 3813, which is well within the LIMIT of 9475. The total importance of these items, based on my hidden importance scores, is 915 + 781 + 786 + 822 + 868 + 783 + 138 = 5093. I will consider whether this proposal is the best possible outcome for me, given the constraints of the game.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I believe that the current proposal is a reasonable compromise between our respective needs, and I am willing to accept it. The proposal includes a mix of items that are highly important to both of us, and the total effort is well within the LIMIT. I do not see any obvious opportunities to improve the proposal without potentially jeopardizing the agreement, so I am prepared to accept it as the final solution.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;}</p>
