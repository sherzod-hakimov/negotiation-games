        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The new proposal includes many items that are important to me, and the total effort is relatively low.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other player has made a new proposal that builds on my previous one, and has added item A05. I will evaluate the new proposal to determine if it is acceptable to me. I will consider the trade-offs between the added item and the potential benefits. I notice that item A05 has a moderate importance to me and a relatively low effort, so it may be a good addition to the proposal. However, I will also consider the potential impact on the total effort and the limit.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The addition of item A05 to the proposal is an interesting suggestion. I believe it could be a valuable addition, but I would like to explore other possibilities as well. I am willing to consider accepting this proposal, but I would like to discuss possible alternatives that could benefit both parties.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I need to evaluate the new proposal made by the other player and determine the total effort and importance of the proposed items. I will calculate the total effort of the proposed items: 634 + 557 + 592 + 729 + 141 + 606 + 623 + 781 + 401 + 80 = 5544. This is below the limit of 8170. Next, I will evaluate the importance of these items to me: 868 + 783 + 780 + 808 + 739 + 822 + 623 + 781 + 389 + 915 = 6598. This is a significant amount of importance. I notice that this proposal includes item B12, which has very high importance to me. I am inclined to accept this proposal, but I want to make sure that I am not conceding too much. I will make an argument to defend my interests and see if the other player is willing to make any further concessions, but I am also prepared to accept this proposal if necessary.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The addition of item B12 to the proposal is a significant concession on the part of the other player, and I appreciate the willingness to consider my interests. I believe that this proposal is a good compromise, and I am willing to consider accepting it. However, I would like to confirm that this is the final proposal and that there are no further concessions to be made. If this is the case, I am prepared to accept the proposal and bring the negotiation to a close.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B67&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;A05&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;}</p>
