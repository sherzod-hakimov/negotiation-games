        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I understand the concern about the importance-to-effort ratio, and I am willing to reconsider the proposed set. However, I believe that items like B45 and B60 are still valuable additions, as they have relatively low effort values and moderate importance values. I would like to discuss potential alternatives to C06, such as A16 or A66, which may have higher importance values and could potentially replace C06 in the proposed set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;, &#x27;B45&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I will evaluate the new proposed set and calculate its total effort to ensure it is within the limit. The total effort is 725 + 218 + 935 + 138 + 261 + 207 = 2484, which is still below the limit of 9612. I will also assess the importance of the new proposed set and consider potential counter-proposals. I notice that A16 has a high importance value for me, so including it in the set is a good addition. However, I may try to negotiate further to include other items that have high importance values for me, such as B12 or A84, which could potentially replace some of the lower-importance items in the proposed set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I appreciate the consideration of alternative items and the addition of A16 to the proposed set. However, I would like to discuss the potential inclusion of B12, which has a high importance value for me and a relatively high effort value. I believe that B12 could be a valuable addition to the set, and I am willing to consider replacing some of the lower-importance items, such as B45 or B60, to make room for B12.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;, &#x27;B45&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other participant has refused my revised proposal and has expressed interest in including B12, which has a high importance value for them. This suggests that B12 is a high-priority item for them, and I should consider its inclusion in the proposed set. However, I also need to ensure that the total effort of the set remains within the limit. I will analyze the effort values of the items in the current proposal and see if there are any opportunities to replace or remove items to make room for B12.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I understand the value of B12 and am willing to consider its inclusion in the proposed set. However, I also need to ensure that the total effort of the set remains manageable. I propose replacing B60 with B12, as B60 has a relatively low importance value compared to B12.
