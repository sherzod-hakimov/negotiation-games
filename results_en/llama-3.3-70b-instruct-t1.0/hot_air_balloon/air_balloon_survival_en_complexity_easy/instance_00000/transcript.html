However, I think we can make some adjustments to increase the overall importance of the set. I&#x27;m concerned that B69, although having a low effort value, has a relatively low importance value for me. I&#x27;d like to explore alternatives that could replace B69 and potentially increase the total importance of the set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;} <br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;While the revised proposal is an improvement, I believe we can find a better combination of items. I refuse this proposal to encourage further negotiation and exploration of other possibilities that could lead to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I&#x27;m willing to consider alternative proposals that address my concerns and potentially increase the total importance of the set.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other participant has refused my revised proposal and is looking to make adjustments to increase the overall importance of the set. They&#x27;ve expressed concerns about B69 having a relatively low importance value, so I&#x27;ll consider replacing it with an alternative item. I&#x27;ll review the item effort values and my personal importance values to find a suitable replacement that doesn&#x27;t exceed the LIMIT. I&#x27;ll also try to anticipate which items the other participant might value highly, based on their previous comments. Since they mentioned being concerned about B69&#x27;s importance value, I&#x27;ll look for items with higher importance values that could potentially replace it.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;} <br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I&#x27;ve revised my proposal to replace B69 with B12, which has a higher importance value for me and is still within the LIMIT. I believe this revised proposal addresses the other participant&#x27;s concerns and potentially increases the total importance of the set. B12 is a valuable item that I think could be a good addition to the set, and I&#x27;m willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;} <br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I&#x27;ve revised my proposal to replace B69 with B12, which has a higher importance value for me and is still within the LIMIT.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I will analyze the revised proposal and calculate the total effort: 156 + 951 + 345 + 259 + 479 = 2190. This is still within the LIMIT. Considering my importance values for these items: A08 (868), B00 (583), B60 (808), B12 (915), and C15 (781), the total importance to me is 868 + 583 + 808 + 915 + 781 = 3955. I notice that B12 has a very high importance value for me, and I&#x27;m pleased to see it included in the proposal. The total importance of this set is significantly higher than the previous proposals, and I think it&#x27;s a strong candidate for agreement. However, I should consider whether I can propose any adjustments to further increase the total importance to me, while still being within the LIMIT.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I&#x27;m impressed with the revised proposal, which includes B12, an item that is extremely valuable to me. The addition of B12 significantly increases the total importance of the set, and I believe this proposal is a strong candidate for agreement. I appreciate the effort to address my concerns and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Before agreeing, I&#x27;d like to confirm that this proposal is indeed the best possible combination of items that balances importance and effort.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;} <br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;After careful consideration, I&#x27;m pleased to accept the revised proposal. I believe this set of items provides a excellent balance of importance and effort, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the total importance of the set. I think we&#x27;ve found a mutually beneficial agreement, and I&#x27;m willing to conclude the negotiation with this proposal.&#x27;}</p>
