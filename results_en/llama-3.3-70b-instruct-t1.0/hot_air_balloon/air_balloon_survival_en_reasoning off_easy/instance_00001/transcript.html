However, I&#x27;m concerned that the total effort of 3991 is very close to the LIMIT, leaving little room for further adjustments. I&#x27;d like to consider alternative combinations that might include other high-importance items, potentially at the expense of some of the lower-importance items in the current proposal. Can we explore other options that might better align with my priorities?&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A19&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;A39&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C73&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;As a counterproposal, I suggest this set, which includes a mix of high-importance items and makes use of the available effort limit.
