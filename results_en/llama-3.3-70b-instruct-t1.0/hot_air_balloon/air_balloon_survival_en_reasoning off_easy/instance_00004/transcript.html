        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I like the idea of replacing B11 with C47, as it could bring more importance, and removing C26 is a good compromise to stay within the limit, however, I&#x27;m concerned that the total effort of this proposal is 3193, which is very close to the limit, and I think we should consider one more adjustment to ensure we&#x27;re maximizing importance while staying within the limit, perhaps we could remove C75 and add B91, which has a relatively low effort value and could bring additional importance&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A19&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;}</p>

        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I agree that removing C75 and adding B91 is a good trade-off, as B91 has a relatively low effort value and could bring significant importance, and I think this proposal strikes a good balance between importance and effort, the total effort of 3071 is well within the limit, and I believe this set of items maximizes our overall importance&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A19&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;}</p>
