        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I see that adding B26 to the revised proposal does indeed stay within the effort limit, and it&#x27;s a good point that it could increase the overall importance, however, I have some concerns that the addition of B26 might compromise the balance of the set, I&#x27;d like to consider an alternative that maintains the original balance while exploring other options for adding importance&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A19&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;} <br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This alternative adds A56, which has a moderate effort requirement, and could potentially bring significant importance, while maintaining a diverse set of items, the total effort would be 919 + 299 + 161 + 100 + 130 + 354 = 1963, well within the limit&#x27;}</p>

        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I appreciate the alternative proposal that adds A56 instead of B26, as it does maintain a good balance and diversity in the set, and the total effort is comfortably within the limit, I am inclined to agree to this proposal as it seems to strike a good balance between effort and potential importance&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A19&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;}</p>
