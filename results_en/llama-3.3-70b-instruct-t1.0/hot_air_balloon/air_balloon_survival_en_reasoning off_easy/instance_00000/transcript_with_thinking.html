        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I understand the appeal of including A30 due to its potential value, and combining it with C47 and B91 does seem to create a focused set; however, I need to consider whether this combination maximizes our overall benefit, given the constraints of the effort limit and the potential trade-offs involved&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;}</p>
