        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The proposed set seems to prioritize a balanced selection of items with moderate effort values, which could potentially maximize the overall importance while adhering to the effort constraint, suggesting a more optimized approach to item selection&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Furthermore, the selection appears to consider a mix of items that offer a relatively high importance at a manageable effort cost, indicating a strategic approach to item selection that could lead to a more valuable set, thus warranting a closer examination of this proposal&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;B39&#x27;, &#x27;A21&#x27;, &#x27;A82&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;, &#x27;A60&#x27;}</p>
