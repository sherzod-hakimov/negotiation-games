        "response": "STRATEGIC REASONING: To begin the negotiation, I will analyze the item efforts and my personal importance values to identify the most valuable items for me. I have a list of items with their corresponding efforts and importance values. The effort values are: {\"C17\": 903, \"B41\": 757, \"A71\": 850, \"C00\": 746, \"B35\": 524, \"A77\": 204, \"A03\": 946, \"A04\": 473, \"C54\": 616, \"C01\": 855, \"A87\": 530, \"B32\": 419, \"B86\": 960, \"B33\": 763, \"A10\": 730} and my importance values are: {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}. My goal is to select a subset of items that maximizes my total importance while keeping the total effort below the LIMIT of 5138. I will prioritize items with high importance and relatively low effort, and create an initial proposal based on this analysis. I will start by calculating the total importance and effort of each possible combination of items to find the optimal set.\n\nARGUMENT: My initial proposal will focus on items with high importance and relatively low effort, as these items provide the best value for me. By prioritizing these items, I can maximize my total importance while minimizing the total effort.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A71', 'C00', 'B35', 'C54', 'A10'}",
