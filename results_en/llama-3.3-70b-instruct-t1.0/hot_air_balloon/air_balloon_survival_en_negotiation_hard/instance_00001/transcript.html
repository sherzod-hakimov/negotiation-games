        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The proposed set {&#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;} has a total effort of 2910, which is below the LIMIT. I will consider the importance-to-effort ratio of each item in the proposal and think about potential changes that could increase my total importance while staying within the LIMIT. I am especially interested in the inclusion of &#x27;B35&#x27; and &#x27;A10&#x27;, which have relatively low effort values.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I will evaluate the potential benefits of refusing the proposal and proposing an alternative set of items. However, I will also consider the potential risks of delaying an agreement and the potential benefits of reaching a mutually acceptable solution. For now, I will refrain from refusing the proposal and instead propose a modification to the set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;} <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This proposed set has a total effort of: 997 + 665 + 742 + 513 + 366 = 3283, which is below the LIMIT. I believe this set provides a good balance of importance and effort for me, and I am interested in hearing the other player&#x27;s thoughts on this proposal.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other player has proposed a modified set {&#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;}. I need to evaluate this new proposal and think about my next move. I will calculate the total effort and importance of the proposed set and compare it to my own priorities. I notice that the proposed set has a higher total effort than my previous proposal, but it still stays within the LIMIT. I should consider the potential benefits of accepting this proposal and reaching a mutually acceptable solution.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I will evaluate the proposed set {&#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;} and consider its total effort and importance. The total effort is 3283, which is below the LIMIT. I notice that the other player has replaced &#x27;B35&#x27; with &#x27;A03&#x27;, which has a higher effort value. I need to think about whether this substitution is beneficial to me and if I can accept this proposal.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Considering the proposed set {&#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;}, I believe it is a reasonable compromise between our interests. The set includes high-importance items for me, such as &#x27;A71&#x27; and &#x27;C00&#x27;, and also considers the other player&#x27;s priorities. I am willing to accept this proposal and reach a mutually acceptable solution.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;}</p>
