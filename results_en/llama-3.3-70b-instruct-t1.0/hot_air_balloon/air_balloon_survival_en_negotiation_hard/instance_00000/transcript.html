        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I will analyze the new proposal and calculate its total effort to ensure it does not exceed the LIMIT. I notice that the opponent has replaced &quot;A77&quot; with &quot;C01&quot;, which has a higher effort value. I will evaluate the importance-to-effort ratios of the proposed items and compare them with the ratios of other items not included in the proposal. Since the opponent has included &quot;C01&quot;, I will consider the potential benefits of including items that have high importance-to-effort ratios and are complementary to &quot;C01&quot;. I will also think about making a counter-proposal that includes items that are more beneficial to me while still being within the LIMIT.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I appreciate the adjustment to the proposal, and I agree that &quot;C01&quot; is a good addition. However, I would like to discuss the inclusion of &quot;C00&quot; and &quot;B86&quot;, which have relatively low importance-to-effort ratios compared to other items. I propose that we consider replacing one or both of these items with alternatives that have higher importance-to-effort ratios, such as &quot;A04&quot; or &quot;B41&quot;, to further maximize our total importance while staying within the LIMIT.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other player has refused my previous proposal and made a new counter-proposal. I will evaluate this proposal to determine if it meets my goals and consider potential adjustments. I notice that this proposal includes a strong set of items with high importance-to-effort ratios, such as &quot;B41&quot;, &quot;B32&quot;, &quot;A10&quot;, and &quot;C01&quot;. The inclusion of &quot;A04&quot; is also reasonable. I will calculate the total effort and importance of this proposal to see if it is acceptable to me. Since the proposal seems to be a good balance of effort and importance, I might consider accepting it or making a minor adjustment.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I appreciate the new proposal and the inclusion of high-importance items. I agree that &quot;B41&quot;, &quot;B32&quot;, &quot;A10&quot;, and &quot;C01&quot; are strong choices. I also think that &quot;A04&quot; is a reasonable addition. However, I would like to verify that the total effort of this proposal is within the LIMIT. If it is, I am inclined to accept this proposal as it seems to provide a good balance of effort and importance.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;}</p>
