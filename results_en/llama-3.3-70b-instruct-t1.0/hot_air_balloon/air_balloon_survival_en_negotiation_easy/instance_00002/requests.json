The proposed items are C55, A67, C10, B36, and A18. Their respective efforts are 41, 75, 129, 350, and 118. The total effort is 41 + 75 + 129 + 350 + 118 = 713. This is well within the limit of 3288. Next, I should consider the importance of these items to me, which is 583, 822, 780, 461, and 484 respectively. The total importance is 583 + 822 + 780 + 461 + 484 = 3130. This proposal seems to cover a significant portion of potential importance but does not maximize my potential gain since I do not know the opponent's importance values. My strategy should involve evaluating this proposal's benefit to me, considering potential counter-proposals that could increase my gain without exceeding the effort limit, and negotiating based on the principle of maximizing my importance scores while staying within the limit.'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'The proposed set seems reasonable in terms of effort, but I am concerned about the overall distribution of importance. Without knowing the exact importance values of the other party, it's challenging to directly argue for or against this proposal based solely on the effort. However, considering the variety of items and their relatively balanced effort distribution, this proposal might be a good starting point for negotiations. I would like to explore if there are other combinations that could potentially benefit both parties more, especially considering the significant gap between the total effort of the proposed items and the effort limit.'}\n\nPROPOSAL: {'C08', 'C55', 'A43', 'A67', 'B42', 'C10'}"
