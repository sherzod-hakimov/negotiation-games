	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'The latest proposal includes high-importance items but also significantly high-effort ones. Calculating the total effort: 906 + 950 + 612 + 689 + 997 + 551 + 873 + 528 + 733 = 5839, which is within the LIMIT. Considering my own importance values, items like A94 and C72, despite being high-effort, might not be as crucial to me as other items not included in this proposal.

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'The negotiation has reached a point where both parties are refining their proposals to maximize benefit within the effort LIMIT. The current proposal from the opponent includes a range of items that seem to balance effort and importance. To proceeds, I should analyze this proposal in detail, considering the importance and effort of each item, and decide whether it meets my goals or if further negotiation is needed to optimize the selection. It's also crucial to be prepared to make concessions or suggest alternative items that could improve the agreement for both parties.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'The proposal presents a well-rounded selection of items, considering both effort and potential importance.
