I notice that the proposal includes A94 and A71, which are both high{-}importance items for me, as well as low{-}effort items like C53, C17, B69, and A08. I will consider whether this proposal is acceptable or if I can make a counter{-}proposal that includes other high{-}importance items. I will also consider the potential risks of making a counter{-}proposal, such as the other player refusing it and proposing a less desirable set.'\}} \\

\texttt{ARGUMENT: \{'The proposed set includes a good combination of high{-}importance items like A94 and A71, as well as low{-}effort items like C53, C17, B69, and A08. I believe that this proposal is a reasonable combination of importance and effort, and I am inclined to accept it. However, I would like to consider whether there are any other high{-}importance items that could be added to the proposal without exceeding the limit.'\}} \\
