        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other player has refused my previous proposal and made a new proposal that includes A94, which is a high-importance item for me. I need to evaluate this new proposal and consider my options. I will analyze the effort and importance of the items in the new proposal and think about whether I can accept it, refuse it, or make a counter-proposal. I will also consider the potential for further negotiation and try to find a compromise that benefits both parties. It seems that A94 is a key item that the other player is willing to include, and I should consider building on this proposal.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The proposed set includes A94, which is a high-importance item for me, and also includes some low-effort items like C53, C17, and B69. The inclusion of A71 adds significant importance to the proposal. I am concerned that the proposal may not be maximal, but it seems like a reasonable combination of high-importance items and low-effort items. I would like to consider whether this proposal is acceptable or if I can make a counter-proposal that includes other high-importance items.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A94&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C53&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I will analyze the new proposal and calculate the total effort of the proposed items. The total effort is 950 + 588 + 188 + 301 + 239 + 132 = 2398. This is still within the limit of 10073. I will then calculate the importance of these items to me, which is 1049 + 687 + 287 + 400 + 338 + 231 = 2992. I notice that the proposal includes A94 and A71, which are both high-importance items for me, as well as low-effort items like C53, C17, B69, and A08. I will consider whether this proposal is acceptable or if I can make a counter-proposal that includes other high-importance items. I will also consider the potential risks of making a counter-proposal, such as the other player refusing it and proposing a less desirable set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The proposed set includes a good combination of high-importance items like A94 and A71, as well as low-effort items like C53, C17, B69, and A08. I believe that this proposal is a reasonable combination of importance and effort, and I am inclined to accept it. However, I would like to consider whether there are any other high-importance items that could be added to the proposal without exceeding the limit.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A94&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;C53&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;}</p>
