Their argument about potentially replacing lower-importance items like A88 with others that offer a better importance-to-effort ratio is reasonable. I should consider alternative items that could be added or substituted to improve the proposal's overall importance without exceeding the effort limit. Since A88 has a relatively low effort (123) and importance (222) to me, it might be a good candidate for replacement. I could explore adding another item that has a higher importance-to-effort ratio, such as C10 or A46, and see if this revised proposal is more acceptable.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'I understand the other participant's concerns about the importance-to-effort ratio of the items in the proposal. I agree that A88 could be a candidate for replacement, given its relatively low importance and effort. I would like to propose an alternative that substitutes A88 with another item, potentially improving the overall importance of the set while keeping the total effort in check. This could involve adding an item like C10, which has an effort of 240 and an importance of 339 to me, although the specific replacement would depend on our shared priorities and the effort limit.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'B34', 'A65', 'C53', 'B23', 'A97', 'C10', 'B95'}

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'The other participant has revised the proposal to replace A88 with C10, which has a higher importance and moderate effort. I will evaluate this new proposal and consider its implications. The addition of C10 increases the total importance of the set, but the total effort is still within the LIMIT. I will analyze the trade-offs and consider whether this proposal is acceptable to me, or if I should try to negotiate further to maximize my own importance. I will also consider the potential for further adjustments to the proposal, such as replacing or adding other items to optimize the importance-to-effort ratio.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'I appreciate the other participant's willingness to revise the proposal to improve the importance-to-effort ratio. The addition of C10 is a good compromise, as it increases the total importance of the set while keeping the effort manageable. I am inclined to accept this proposal, as it seems to balance our shared priorities and constraints. However, I would like to confirm that this proposal is acceptable to both of us, and that we are not overlooking any other potential adjustments that could further improve the outcome.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt AGREE: {'B34', 'A65', 'C53', 'B23', 'A97', 'C10', 'B95'}
