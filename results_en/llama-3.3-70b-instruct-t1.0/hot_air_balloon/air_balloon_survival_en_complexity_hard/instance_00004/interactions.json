Their argument about potentially replacing lower-importance items like A88 with others that offer a better importance-to-effort ratio is reasonable. I should consider alternative items that could be added or substituted to improve the proposal's overall importance without exceeding the effort limit. Since A88 has a relatively low effort (123) and importance (222) to me, it might be a good candidate for replacement. I could explore adding another item that has a higher importance-to-effort ratio, such as C10 or A46, and see if this revised proposal is more acceptable.'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'I understand the other participant's concerns about the importance-to-effort ratio of the items in the proposal. I agree that A88 could be a candidate for replacement, given its relatively low importance and effort. I would like to propose an alternative that substitutes A88 with another item, potentially improving the overall importance of the set while keeping the total effort in check.
