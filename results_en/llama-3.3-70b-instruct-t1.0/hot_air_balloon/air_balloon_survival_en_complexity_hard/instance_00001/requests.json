            "content": "STRATEGIC REASONING: \nTo begin, I need to consider the constraints and objectives of the game. My goal is to maximize the total importance of the items I select while staying within the given effort limit of 8145. Since I do not know the other participant's importance values, I must focus on optimizing my own selection. I should start by examining the effort values of the items and identifying which ones offer the highest importance to me relative to their effort. Given that I have a personal view of the importance of each item, I can use this information to guide my initial proposal. I will prioritize items with high importance and relatively low effort, aiming to include a mix that maximizes my total importance without exceeding the effort limit. I will calculate the total effort of my proposed items to ensure it is within the limit. For my initial proposal, I will consider including items such as 'A25', 'A71', 'B96', 'C79', and 'C82', as they seem to offer a good balance between importance and effort based on my personal view. Now, I will proceed to create my initial proposal based on this strategic reasoning.\n\nARGUMENT: Given the effort limit of 8145 and my personal view of item importance, I believe it is crucial to select items that offer a high importance-to-effort ratio.
