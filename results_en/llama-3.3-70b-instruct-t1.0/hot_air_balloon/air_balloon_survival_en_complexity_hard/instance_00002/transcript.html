        <p>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I appreciate the willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. To move forward, I would like to discuss potential adjustments to the proposed set that could add high-importance items for both parties. Perhaps we could consider adding items like A87 or B23, which were part of my initial proposal, and removing some lower-priority items to make room for them. Alternatively, we could explore other combinations that balance effort and importance effectively.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A97&#x27;, &#x27;B64&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C53&#x27;, &#x27;B43&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I will evaluate the new proposal by calculating its total effort: 679 + 619 + 962 + 300 + 226 = 2786, which is still below the LIMIT of 9322. The addition of A87, a high-importance item for both of us, is a positive step. However, I need to consider the overall importance of this set to me and how it compares to potential alternatives. I notice that B43 is not as important to me as some other items, and I still have high-importance items like A96, A75, and B23 that are not included. My next move will be to argue for adjustments that further prioritize my high-importance items, potentially by suggesting substitutions that maintain or reduce the total effort while increasing the overall importance to me.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The inclusion of A87 in the new proposal is a step in the right direction, as it is a high-importance item for both parties. However, I believe we can further optimize the set by considering substitutions that increase the overall importance to both of us. For instance, replacing C53 with a higher-importance item for me, like A75, could enhance the set&#x27;s value, provided the effort remains manageable. Let&#x27;s explore such adjustments to create a more balanced and mutually beneficial set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A97&#x27;, &#x27;B64&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C53&#x27;, &#x27;B43&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other participant has refused my third proposal and suggested replacing C53 with A75 to increase the overall importance of the set. This indicates that A75 is a high-importance item for them, and including it could make the set more appealing to them. I should consider this substitution, as well as other potential adjustments that could balance the effort and importance of the set. Since A75 has a relatively high effort, I will need to carefully evaluate the impact of adding it to the set and determine which other items to remove or keep to stay within the LIMIT. I will also think about the potential trade-offs and try to find a combination that maximizes the importance to both parties.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I understand the suggestion to replace C53 with A75, and I am willing to consider this adjustment. However, I need to ensure that the resulting set remains balanced and efficient in terms of effort. To accommodate A75, I propose removing B43, which has a lower importance to me, and keeping the other high-importance items. This adjustment should increase the overall importance of the set while maintaining a manageable effort.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A97&#x27;, &#x27;B64&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;B15&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Now, I will calculate the total effort of the new proposal: 679 + 619 + 962 + 768 + 115 = 3143, which is still below the LIMIT of 9322. The inclusion of A75, a high-importance item for me, significantly increases the set&#x27;s value to me. The removal of B43 and the retention of A87 and B64, which are important to both of us, indicate a good compromise. Given that this set includes several of my high-importance items and stays within the effort limit, I need to decide whether to accept this proposal or attempt to further negotiate for additional items or substitutions that could increase the set&#x27;s importance to me without exceeding the LIMIT.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;The revised proposal addresses some of my key concerns by including high-importance items like A75 and A87. The set appears to balance effort and importance effectively, considering the constraints. However, before agreeing, I would like to acknowledge that this negotiation has successfully identified a set of items that mutually benefits both parties, given the effort limit. It is crucial to ensure that any final agreement maximizes the importance to both of us, and I believe this proposal makes significant strides in that direction.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A97&#x27;, &#x27;B64&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;B15&#x27;}</p>
