        <p><p>I am your game master, and you are playing a collaborative game with the following grid as game board:</p>

╚═╧═╧═══╝

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.</li>
<li>The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: 'P', 'O', 'T', 'S', 'D', 'A', 'M'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:</li>
<li><code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code>: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.</li>
<li><code>MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)</code>: to move an object to a new position, where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the column and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.</li>
<li>If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 16 penalties, you both lose the game.</li>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code> command!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game</strong></p>
<p>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p>Both players win if the game ends within 28 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<p>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p></p>

<p>"I think the revised arrangement you proposed is a good compromise, given the grid's limitations. I agree with the placements: 'A' in column 1, 'M' in column 7, 'O' in column 2, 'P' in column 3, 'D' in column 4, 'S' in column 5, and 'T' in column 6. Before we start moving objects, let's confirm that we both understand the goal configuration: each object in a unique row, with the rows ordered as initially proposed ('P' in row 1, 'O' in row 2, 'T' in row 3, 'S' in row 4, 'D' in row 5, 'A' in row 6, 'M' in row 7), and the columns as we just discussed. Shall we start moving objects to achieve this configuration?"</p>
<p>What is your next command?</p></p>

        <p><p>SAY: I'm glad we have a agreed upon goal configuration. To confirm, the target configuration is: 'P' in (3,1), 'O' in (2,2), 'T' in (6,3), 'S' in (5,4), 'D' in (4,5), 'A' in (1,6), and 'M' in (7,7). I've double-checked the rows and columns, and everything looks correct. Before we start moving objects, I'd like to suggest that we prioritize moving objects that are currently farthest from their target positions. This might help us make the most progress in the fewest number of moves. What's your thoughts on this approach?</p></p>

        <p><p>SAY: Thank you for the update. I'll review my board and plan my next move. Since 'O' is already in its correct position on my board, I'll focus on creating a path for 'T'. I notice that 'S' is currently at (1,1) on my board, and moving it could potentially create space for other objects. I'll consider moving 'S' to a different position to make way for 'T'. Before I make my move, I'd like to ask: have you considered moving 'T' on your board to its target position (6,3), or is there an obstacle on your board that's preventing you from doing so? Additionally, are there any objects on your board that you think I should be aware of when planning my next move?</p></p>

        <p><p>SAY: On my board, 'T' is currently at (3,3), and its target position is indeed (6,3). However, the target position (6,3) on my board is occupied by '└' (a frame piece), not an object that can be moved. This means that I won't be able to move 'T' to its target position until we can somehow remove or move the frame piece. As for objects on my board that you should be aware of, I think it's worth noting that 'S' is currently at (6,5) on my board, which is close to the target position for 'T'. If you're planning to move 'S' on your board, it might be helpful to coordinate our moves to ensure that we're not creating conflicts or duplicating efforts. Let me know your thoughts on how to proceed with moving 'T' and creating a path for it to reach its target position.</p></p>

        <p><p>SAY: That's a good point about the frame piece on your board. Since we can't move the frame pieces, we'll have to work around them. On my board, I have a similar issue with the '┘' frame piece at (6,3), which is also blocking the target position for 'T'. Considering our goal configuration, I think we should focus on moving the objects that are currently occupying the target rows for 'T', rather than trying to move the frame pieces. Consider the objects that are currently in the target row for 'T' - can we move any of those objects to create space and allow 'T' to move into its target row? Let's review our boards and see if there are any objects that we can move to make way for 'T'. I'll take another look at my board and see what options I have.</p></p>

        <p><p>SAY: I moved 'S' to (5,1) on my grid, which puts it in column 5 as we planned. I'll need to move it to row 4 eventually, but for now, it's in the correct column. Congratulations on moving 'S' to its target position (5,4) on your board! That's a big step towards our goal configuration. As for moving 'T' to its target position (6,3), I think we should continue to focus on creating space and clearing a path for 'T'. On my board, I'll look for opportunities to move objects out of the way and create a chain reaction that could help 'T' move into its target row. Do you have any specific ideas for how to move 'T' on your board, or would you like to coordinate our next moves to ensure we're working together effectively?</p></p>

        <p><p>SAY: Thanks for the update! I'm glad we were able to move 'S' to column 5 on both our boards. Now, let's focus on moving 'T' to its target position (6,3). On my board, I think I can try to move 'T' to a different column in row 3, to get it closer to its target position. However, as we previously discussed, the frame piece '└' is occupying the target position, so we'll need to find a way to work around it. I'd like to propose that we try to move 'D' on both our boards to create some space and potentially clear a path for 'T'. Since 'D' is supposed to end up in row 5, column 4, maybe we can try to move it to a position that will ultimately help 'T' move into its target row. What do you think? Should we try to move 'D' on both our boards and see how it affects the overall situation?</p></p>
