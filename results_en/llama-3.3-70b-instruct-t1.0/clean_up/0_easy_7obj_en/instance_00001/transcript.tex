\texttt{ 1. `SAY: <MESSAGE>`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.} \\

\texttt{"I agree that we should reassess our goal state considering the obstacles and constraints of the board. Given that 'S' needs to move to (1,6) but is blocked by the frame, and considering the rules that don't allow movement through frame borders, it seems challenging to achieve the original alignment. Discussing an alternative alignment that is more feasible with the current board state is a practical approach. Let's explore options for an alternative goal state that we can realistically achieve within the remaining moves, ensuring we maximize our score by aligning as many objects as possible according to our original plan."} \\
