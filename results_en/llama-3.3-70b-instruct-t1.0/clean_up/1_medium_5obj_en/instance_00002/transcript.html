        <p>I am your game master, and you are playing a collaborative game with the following grid as game board:<br/><br/>```<br/> 1234567<br/>╔═╤═╤═╤═╗<br/>║◌│◌│H│◌║ 1<br/>╟─┴─┼─┤◌║ 2<br/>║◌T◌│◌└─╢ 3<br/>╟───┘◌◌◌║ 4<br/>║◌◌◌I◌┌─╢ 5<br/>║◌◌◌C◌│◌║ 6<br/>║◌◌◌W◌│◌║ 7<br/>╚═════╧═╝<br/><br/>```<br/><br/>* The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.<br/>* The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: &#x27;W&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27;.<br/><br/><br/>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player&#x27;s board, and they cannot see yours.<br/><br/><br/>**Goal:**<br/><br/>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.<br/><br/><br/>**Rules:**<br/><br/>* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:<br/> 1. `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.<br/>2. `MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)`: to move an object to a new position, where `&lt;X&gt;` is the column and `&lt;Y&gt;` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.<br/>* If you don&#x27;t stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.<br/>* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.<br/>* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;` command!<br/><br/><br/>**Moving Objects**<br/><br/>* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol &#x27;◌&#x27;.<br/>* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.<br/>* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!<br/><br/><br/>**End of Game**<br/><br/>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.<br/><br/>Both players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.<br/><br/>**Scoring:**<br/><br/>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?<br/><br/><br/>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p>

I made a mistake again!<br/> I want W in (4,2) for now, lets move W in my current grid to get to that configuration!<br/> I see the column 4, with W at (4,7), C at (4,6), I at (4,5)<br/> I can move W up!<br/> MOVE: W, (4,7) -&gt; (4,6) <br/> But that position is occupied... by C!<br/> I must move it first!<br/> But I need I, to move up first to (4,4) in the grid of target positions -&gt; can&#x27;t!<br/> column 4 has I, C, W... move C to start, clear path!<br/> MOVE: C, (4,6) -&gt; (4,5) <br/>No, lets try it<br/> MOVE: C is at (4,6), move it first to clear the path to move other objects up the column<br/> MOVE: C, (4,6) -&gt; (5, not valid) or (3,6) -&gt; NOT! -&gt; W, behind C... so move C first, then W!<br/> No! move it!<br/> lets first see... (4,5) -&gt; occupied by I!<br/> And C is in the way!<br/> I need to move I...<br/> I want to move I to (4,3), but I has C in (4,6), W in (4,7)<br/> column 4 has: I, C, W!<br/> lets think backwards...<br/> start from the wanted position... and work our way backwards!<br/> What is the goal... H in (1,1), T in (3,1), I in (4,3), C in (4,4), W in (4,2)... <br/> We have: H in (1,1), and T in (3,1) -&gt; done... now lets deal with column 4: W is in (4,7), C in (4,6) I in (4,5)<br/> We have: W -&gt; needs to get to (4,2) C -&gt; needs to get to (4,4) I -&gt; needs to get to (4,3)<br/> This in our current grid is in column 4: I, C, W<br/> Our target is column 4: W, I, C -&gt; first we need to move W up the stack, but C is in (4,6) I in (4,5), W in (4,7)<br/> To get to our goal: <br/> I am at the state: H in (1,1), T in (3,1) and column 4 with I, C, W.<br/> lets look at I... our target for I is (4,3) -&gt; that is currently occupied!<br/> Target: H in (1,1) T in (3,1), W in (4,2), I in (4,3), C in (4,4) <br/> currently in column 4, from top to bottom: empty, empty, empty, empty, I, C, W.<br/> Our goal, in column 4 from top to bottom is: W, I, C, empty<br/> current column 4: I, C, W, our target for column 4 is: W, I, C<br/> first I move W up...<br/> MOVE: W, (4,7) -&gt; (4,6) no, that is occupied by C<br/> first move C!<br/> MOVE: C, (4,6) -&gt; (4,5) <br/> wait we have I, in (4,5)<br/> MOVE: I, (4,5) -&gt; (3,5) no, we don&#x27;t want that<br/> MOVE: I, no! First move the C to make space, or move W to the right and then we have: (3,7), (4,7), (5,7)...<br/> first move C is not possible since we have I in (4,5) <br/> MOVE: I, no! <br/> MOVE: I to where? not (4,5), or (4,6), (4,7), or (3,5), or (5,5) -&gt; no...<br/> lets try moving I up -&gt; we can&#x27;t we have: (4,5) -&gt; occupied by I, (4,4) -&gt; empty, no!, (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) <br/> our target: (4,2) for W -&gt; occupied, (4,3) for I -&gt; occupied in our current grid by the ┼ symbol<br/> first!<br/> lets think, we have in our grid: (4,7) -&gt; W, (4,6) -&gt; C, (4,5) -&gt; I <br/> MOVE: C -&gt; no, first!<br/> our goal is: W in (4,2), I in (4,3), C in (4,4)<br/> we have C in (4,6), and W in (4,7), so first move the objects down the line, no...<br/> lets move it!<br/> MOVE: I, (4,5) -&gt; (4,4) -&gt; no! that is not where we want it!<br/> MOVE: I -&gt; no! <br/>lets see where we can move I to? <br/> column 4 has: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) <br/> target is (4,3) <br/> lets move the C to the side: no!<br/> our goal is (4,3) <br/> lets move I first: <br/>  our target is to have I, C, W, and we want it in W, I, C <br/> our current is I, C, W<br/> MOVE: C -&gt; no... our current column 4 is I, C, W, and we need to have it W, I, C...<br/> lets try it...<br/> MOVE: C, no... <br/>  Our current grid has H, T <br/> column 4 has I, C, W, our target is W, I, C, in that order in column 4 <br/> MOVE: I -&gt; first move C!<br/> MOVE: I, no...<br/> MOVE: C, no...<br/> we have: H in (1,1) and T in (3,1) <br/> MOVE: W -&gt; no... first move C, then W<br/> lets move it to: <br/> column 4: <br/> first move C?<br/> current: I, C, W <br/> we want: W, I, C <br/> lets do this <br/> first I move C -&gt; it is blocked by I!<br/> MOVE: I -&gt; no! <br/> MOVE: C -&gt; no! <br/> MOVE: I -&gt; where? <br/> lets clear path first!<br/> MOVE: C -&gt; where? <br/> MOVE: C, no... <br/> lets move I first <br/> no, MOVE: C first!<br/> MOVE: I -&gt; no! first move the other piece!<br/> MOVE: C -&gt; yes!<br/> MOVE: C, (4,6) -&gt; (4,5) -&gt; no, I is there!<br/> lets think again: column 4: (4,1) -&gt; empty, (4,2) -&gt; empty, (4,3) -&gt; empty, but has the symbol ┼, (4,4) -&gt; empty, (4,5) -&gt; I, (4,6) -&gt; C, (4,7) -&gt; W<br/> lets see...
