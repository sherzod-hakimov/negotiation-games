        <p>I am your game master, and you are playing a collaborative game with the following grid as game board:<br/><br/>```<br/> 1234567<br/>╔═╤═╤═╤═╗<br/>║◌│◌│◌│◌║ 1<br/>║◌└─┼─┴─╢ 2<br/>║◌◌◌│◌◌◌║ 3<br/>╟──┬┴───╢ 4<br/>║◌◌│P◌◌◌║ 5<br/>║LC│◌◌◌◌║ 6<br/>║◌◌│◌◌◌◌║ 7<br/>╚══╧════╝<br/><br/>```<br/><br/>* The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.<br/>* The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;L&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27;.<br/><br/><br/>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player&#x27;s board, and they cannot see yours.<br/><br/><br/>**Goal:**<br/><br/>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.<br/><br/><br/>**Rules:**<br/><br/>* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:<br/> 1. `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.<br/>2. `MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)`: to move an object to a new position, where `&lt;X&gt;` is the column and `&lt;Y&gt;` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.<br/>* If you don&#x27;t stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.<br/>* If both players accumulate more than 8 penalties, you both lose the game.<br/>* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;` command!<br/><br/><br/>**Moving Objects**<br/><br/>* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol &#x27;◌&#x27;.<br/>* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.<br/>* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!<br/><br/><br/>**End of Game**<br/><br/>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.<br/><br/>Both players win if the game ends within 12 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.<br/><br/>**Scoring:**<br/><br/>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?<br/><br/><br/>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p>

        <p>SAY: I agree that prioritizing the objects farthest from their target positions is a good strategy. Since &#x27;P&#x27; on both our boards is indeed far from its target position at (1,1), let&#x27;s start with moving &#x27;P&#x27;. I suggest we move our respective &#x27;P&#x27; objects independently, as synchronizing the exact moves might be challenging given the different initial positions. On my board, &#x27;P&#x27; is at (4,5), so I plan to move it towards the target position (1,1) in a way that seems optimal to me. You can do the same based on your board&#x27;s &#x27;P&#x27; position at (4,6). After we both move our &#x27;P&#x27; objects, we can reassess and communicate our next steps to ensure we&#x27;re aligning our configurations. Before I make my move, I just want to confirm: are we aiming to keep the objects within the grid boundaries and only move them to empty cells, as per the rules?</p>

        <p>SAY: Yes, let&#x27;s confirm that we will only move the objects to empty cells within the grid boundaries, following the rules. This ensures that our moves are valid and helps us avoid penalties. With that confirmed, I&#x27;m ready to proceed with moving my &#x27;P&#x27; from (4,6) towards the target position (1,1). I will make my move independently, as discussed. Before I do, I just want to acknowledge that after moving our &#x27;P&#x27; objects, we should share our new &#x27;P&#x27; positions to keep each other informed and adjust our strategies as needed. Please go ahead and make your move, and I&#x27;ll do the same.

        <p>SAY: Congratulations on moving your &#x27;P&#x27; object to (2,5)! Given the target positions and the current state of our boards, I suggest we focus on moving our &#x27;P&#x27; objects to (1,1) first, as it seems to be the most critical step at this point. Once we&#x27;ve achieved this, we can reassess and plan the moves for &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; to their respective target positions. Since we&#x27;re running out of rounds, let&#x27;s prioritize getting &#x27;P&#x27; to (1,1) and then adjust our strategy accordingly. After we&#x27;ve made our final moves, we can check if we&#x27;ve achieved the goal configuration and declare the game finished if we have. Shall we proceed with this plan and make our final moves?</p>
