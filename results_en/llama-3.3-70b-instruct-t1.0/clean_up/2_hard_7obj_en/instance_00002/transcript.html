        <p>I am your game master, and you are playing a collaborative game with the following grid as game board:<br/><br/>```<br/> 1234567<br/>╔═╤═╤═╤═╗<br/>║A│◌│O│◌║ 1<br/>╟─┼─┤◌│◌║ 2<br/>║◌│T│◌│P║ 3<br/>║◌│◌├─┴─╢ 4<br/>╟─┴─┤◌◌◌║ 5<br/>║D◌◌└─┬─╢ 6<br/>║◌◌◌S◌│M║ 7<br/>╚═════╧═╝<br/><br/>```<br/><br/>* The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.<br/>* The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: &#x27;P&#x27;, &#x27;O&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;M&#x27;.<br/><br/><br/>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player&#x27;s board, and they cannot see yours.<br/><br/><br/>**Goal:**<br/><br/>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.<br/><br/><br/>**Rules:**<br/><br/>* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:<br/> 1. `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.<br/>2. `MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)`: to move an object to a new position, where `&lt;X&gt;` is the column and `&lt;Y&gt;` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.<br/>* If you don&#x27;t stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.<br/>* If both players accumulate more than 16 penalties, you both lose the game.<br/>* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;` command!<br/><br/><br/>**Moving Objects**<br/><br/>* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol &#x27;◌&#x27;.<br/>* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.<br/>* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!<br/><br/><br/>**End of Game**<br/><br/>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.<br/><br/>Both players win if the game ends within 28 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.<br/><br/>**Scoring:**<br/><br/>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?<br/><br/><br/>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p>

        <p>Your message has been relayed to the other player.<br/><br/><br/>You are currently playing round 24 of maximum 28.<br/>You have collectively accumulated 7 of 16 penalties.<br/>The other player sent this message:<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Given the obstacles on your board, let&#x27;s consider moving &#x27;T&#x27; instead of &#x27;O&#x27;. On my board, I don&#x27;t have any issues with &#x27;T&#x27;, but on your board, moving &#x27;T&#x27; could help create a clear path for &#x27;M&#x27; to move to (4,4). How about moving &#x27;T&#x27; to (6,3)? If this position is empty on your board, it could help clear the path for &#x27;M&#x27;. Alternatively, we could also consider moving &#x27;T&#x27; to a different position that would achieve the same goal. Please check the possible positions for &#x27;T&#x27; on your board and let me know which one would work best.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>What is your next command?</p>

        <p>SAY: I&#x27;ve checked the possible positions for &#x27;T&#x27; on my board. Moving &#x27;T&#x27; to (6,3) could be a good option, but I need to confirm if the cell (6,3) is empty. If it&#x27;s not empty, I can try to move &#x27;T&#x27; to a different position, such as (5,3) or (6,4), if either of those cells are empty. Can you please wait for my next move, and I&#x27;ll try to move &#x27;T&#x27; to a position that clears the path for &#x27;M&#x27; to move to (4,4)? I&#x27;ll check the board again to ensure the target cell is empty before making the move.</p>
