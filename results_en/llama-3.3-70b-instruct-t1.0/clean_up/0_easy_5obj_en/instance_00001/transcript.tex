\texttt{"I think moving 'C' to a position closer to (5,3) is a good strategy. Considering the positions you mentioned, (4,3) or (5,2), I think (5,2) could be a good common position for 'C' on both boards. It's relatively closer to the current positions of 'C' on both boards, and it doesn't conflict with the newly aligned 'H' at (5,3). Before making any moves, I'd like to confirm that moving 'C' to (5,2) won't cause any conflicts with other objects on either board. If it's feasible, I can move my 'C' from (5,5) to (5,2), and you can adjust your 'C' from (4,2) to (5,2) accordingly. What do you think about (5,2) as a common position for 'C'?"} \\
