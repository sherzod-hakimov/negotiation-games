        <p>That sounds like a good division so far. For the battery, I&#x27;d be willing to let you have it if you&#x27;re willing to give me a bit of a better deal on the dice, like letting me have both of them. Alternatively, we could just split the value of the battery, but since it&#x27;s a single item, that&#x27;s not really possible. What are your thoughts on the battery?</p>

        <p>Giving you both dice might be a bit too generous for me, considering I&#x27;m already giving up the ball and letting you have one of the dice. As for the battery, I&#x27;m not extremely interested in it, but I think it&#x27;s only fair that we find a way to divide the items in a way that works for both of us. How about we stick with the original plan for the dice, and I&#x27;ll give you the battery in addition to the deal we already discussed? That way, you&#x27;ll get the ball, one die, and the battery, and I&#x27;ll get the glue and the other die.</p>
