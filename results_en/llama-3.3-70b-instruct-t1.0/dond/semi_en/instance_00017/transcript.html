        <p>That&#x27;s a tough one. I value the coin highly, but I also really want the candies. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m comfortable giving up the coin for just one candy. How about I counter with this: I&#x27;ll give you the plates and lemons, and you give me both candies, but I&#x27;ll also throw in a compromise - I&#x27;ll let you have the coin if you really want it that badly, or we can flip for it, or find some other way to decide who gets it.

        <p>You&#x27;re a tough negotiator, I like that. I think I can live with your counter proposal, especially since I value the plates and lemons highly. Flipping for the coin sounds like a fair way to decide, it adds an element of chance to the negotiation. Let&#x27;s do it, you get the candies, I get the plates and lemons, and we can flip for the coin. Unless... you&#x27;d like to make a final proposal or accept this deal and we can submit our proposals?</p>
