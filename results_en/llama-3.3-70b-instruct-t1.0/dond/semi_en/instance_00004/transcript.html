        <p>The pepper is somewhat valuable to me, but I think I can let it go if it means getting something else I really want. As for the pictures, I have a bit of a fondness for them, but I can be flexible. How about we focus on making sure each of us gets one of the rare items, and then we can discuss the pictures?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a reasonable approach. If we can agree on the rare items, the pepper and the orange, then we can figure out the pictures afterwards. Would you be willing to give me the pepper if I let you have the orange, and then we can negotiate the pictures?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s a fair trade. I would be willing to give you the pepper in exchange for getting the orange.

        <p>I think splitting them evenly would be the most straightforward solution, don&#x27;t you? Since there are three pictures, I could take one and you could take two. That way, we both get a share of the pictures and we can consider the negotiation complete. What do you think?</p>
