        <p>The pepper is somewhat valuable to me, but I think I can let it go if it means getting something else I really want. As for the pictures, I have a bit of a fondness for them, but I can be flexible. How about we focus on making sure each of us gets one of the rare items, and then we can discuss the pictures?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s a fair trade. I would be willing to give you the pepper in exchange for getting the orange.

        <p>I think splitting them evenly would be the most straightforward solution, don&#x27;t you? Since there are three pictures, I could take one and you could take two. That way, we both get a share of the pictures and we can consider the negotiation complete. What do you think?</p>
