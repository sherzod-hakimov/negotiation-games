        <p>That&#x27;s generous of you regarding the crayons. As for the bolts, I&#x27;m fairly interested in them, but I&#x27;m willing to negotiate. Would you be willing to give me one bolt if I make sure you get the chalk?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s an interesting offer, but I&#x27;m not really interested in the chalk. I&#x27;d rather have both bolts, to be honest. How about we compromise and I get both bolts, and you get the crayons and the chalk?</p>

        <p>So you&#x27;re set on getting both bolts. That&#x27;s a tough one for me, since I value them quite a bit. However, I do value the chalk highly as well, and getting all the crayons is a plus. Okay, deal! You get the bolts, I get the crayons and the chalk. I think we have an agreement.
