        <p>A 2 apples for the egg and soap deal seems intriguing. Considering my own valuations, I think that could be a reasonable trade, as the soap is quite valuable to me and the egg is something I&#x27;d like to have but not at the expense of the soap. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a 1 apple for the egg deal, given that the soap is the more unique item.

        <p>A 1 apple for the egg deal is an interesting counterproposal. I&#x27;m willing to consider it, especially since I value the egg more than the apples. However, I would need to get the soap in return for one of the apples, as you originally suggested. So, a revised deal could be: you get the soap and one apple, and I get the egg and the remaining two apples. Would that be acceptable to you?</p>
