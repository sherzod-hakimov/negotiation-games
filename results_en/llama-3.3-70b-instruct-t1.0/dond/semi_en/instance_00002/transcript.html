        <p>I think I could live with giving up one of the glasses if I could get the shovel. I&#x27;m not too keen on the berries, so you&#x27;re welcome to those. If I got the shovel and two glasses, that would be a good deal for me. What do you think?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a reasonable offer. I think I could accept that deal, it would give me the berries, the bowl, and one glass, which is a decent outcome for me. But before we finalize, I just want to confirm that you&#x27;re willing to give up one glass, so I would get one glass and you would get two, is that correct?</p>
