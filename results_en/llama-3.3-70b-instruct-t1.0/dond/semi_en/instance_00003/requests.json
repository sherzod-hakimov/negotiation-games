If you're willing to give me the sponge and two pens, I might be willing to consider giving you the hat.

Giving you the sponge and two pens for the hat sounds like a decent deal, but giving you the sponge and keeping everything else is a bit more appealing to me.

As for the pens, I'm not too attached to them, so I'm willing to be flexible. How about this: I get the sponge, and you get the hat and one pen?
