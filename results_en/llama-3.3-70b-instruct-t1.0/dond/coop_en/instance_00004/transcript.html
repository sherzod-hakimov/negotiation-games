        <p>I&#x27;m interested in the stamps, I think they could be very valuable. I&#x27;d be happy to discuss a possible division of the stamps between us. What do you think about the thimble, is it something you&#x27;d like to have or are you not interested in it?</p>

        <p>The thimble is actually something I&#x27;d like to have, it seems like a unique item. Since you&#x27;re interested in the stamps, I was thinking maybe I could get the thimble and the soap, and you could get all the stamps? Would that be something you&#x27;d be okay with?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a reasonable proposal, but I was thinking that maybe we could split the stamps, since I&#x27;m really interested in them. Would you be willing to consider giving me 3 of the stamps and you take the thimble and the soap, and I&#x27;ll take the remaining stamp?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s a good compromise, I think we can work with that. So, just to confirm, you&#x27;d get 3 stamps and 1 stamp, and I&#x27;d get the thimble and the soap. I&#x27;m okay with that, it seems like a fair division. Should we make it official?</p>

        <p>It looks like our proposals are complementary. Let&#x27;s see how the scores work out. Since my secret value function is thimble: 2, soap: 0, stamp: 2, I&#x27;ll get a score of 3 * 2 = 6 for the stamps.
