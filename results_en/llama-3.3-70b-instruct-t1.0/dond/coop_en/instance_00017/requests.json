Since you're willing to give me the plate, that's a good compromise. However, I was thinking that maybe we could flip a decision or find another way to decide who gets the pot, since we both want it. Alternatively, I could make a proposal that includes both of us getting what we want, but I'd like to hear your thoughts first."

If you have a proposal that includes both of us getting what we want, I'd love to hear it. Perhaps there's a way to bundle the items or prioritize them that I haven't thought of. Go ahead and share your idea!"

But I was thinking that if we could find a way to divide the items such that we both get a similar overall value, that might be a good compromise. For example, if you really value the pot highly, it might be worth it for me to give it to you, and then I get the plate, which I value highly as well. Does that make sense, or am I overcomplicating things?"

To be honest, I do value the pot quite highly, so getting it would be a big win for me. And if you value the plate highly, it's only fair that you get it. I think we might be close to a mutually beneficial agreement. Why don't we go ahead and make our proposals, and see if we can get a good outcome for both of us?"
