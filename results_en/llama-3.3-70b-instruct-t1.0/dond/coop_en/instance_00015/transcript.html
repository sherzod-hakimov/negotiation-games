        <p>I&#x27;m glad we could agree on the trade. As for the statues, I&#x27;d be willing to consider giving you one, but I&#x27;d have to get something in return.

        <p>In that case, I&#x27;m not sure I have much to offer that would be significant enough to convince you to part with a statue. However, I could offer you a guarantee that I won&#x27;t try to negotiate for any of the other statues, and we can focus on finalizing the trade for the hammer and the nail.
