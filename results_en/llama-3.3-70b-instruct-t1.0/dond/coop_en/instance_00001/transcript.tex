	 It seems we've both submitted our proposals and they are complementary, allowing us to fulfill each other's requests without any conflicts. Based on our agreed division of items, I should calculate the scores now to see how we did. For me, getting 2 bells at a value of 1 each gives me a total score of 2. For you, getting 1 doll at a value of unknown to me but presumably high, and 2 threads, should give you a significant score as well, especially since threads are valued highly by you. Let's assume your values are similar to mine for simplicity, with the doll being 2 and each thread being 3, your total would be 2 (doll) + 3*2 (threads) = 8. Combined, our total score would then be 2 (my score) + 8 (your score) = 10. Of course, this calculation is speculative without knowing your exact values, but it seems we've achieved a good outcome based on our negotiation.

	 Actually, my secret value function was: bell: 0, doll: 2, thread: 4. So, for me, getting 1 doll at a value of 2 and 2 threads at a value of 4 each gives me a total score of 2 + 4*2 = 10. And for you, getting 2 bells at a value of 0 each gives you a total score of 0. I'm glad we were able to negotiate a deal that worked for both of us, even if the actual scores ended up being a bit different from your speculative calculation! Our total combined score is 10 (my score) + 0 (your score) = 10.

	 Actually, my secret value function was: bell: 0, doll: 2, thread: 4. So, for me, getting 1 doll at a value of 2 and 2 threads at a value of 4 each gives me a total score of 2 + 4*2 = 10.

	 Wait, I think there's been a misunderstanding. We already submitted our secret proposals earlier, and they were accepted as complementary, allowing us to divide the items as agreed. My proposal was "[Proposal: 2 bells]" and yours was "[Proposal: 1 doll, 2 threads]". There's no need for another secret proposal now, as the negotiation is concluded.
