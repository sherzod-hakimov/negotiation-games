        <p>2 fruits is a decent proposal. As for the ring, I am interested in it, but I&#x27;m willing to negotiate. If I were to give up my claim on the ring, I&#x27;d want something in return, perhaps the chalk and all 3 fruits?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s a bit more than I had in mind. How about we stick with the original idea of me taking 2 fruits, and in exchange for giving you the ring, you&#x27;d get 1 or 2 fruits, but I&#x27;d keep the chalk?</p>
