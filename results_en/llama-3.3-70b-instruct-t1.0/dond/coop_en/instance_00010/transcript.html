        <p>That&#x27;s an interesting proposal. I think I could live with giving you one of the pliers if you gave me the bucket, but I&#x27;d also want to get the nail in that deal. Would you be willing to throw in the nail as well, or is that too much to ask?</p>

        <p>I see where you&#x27;re going with this. Honestly, the chalk is still quite valuable to me, and giving it up would be a significant concession. But I&#x27;m also interested in reaching a deal that works for both of us. Tell you what - I&#x27;d be willing to give you the chalk if you give me the bucket, the nail, and... you take both pliers. That way, we both get something we really want. What do you think?</p>
