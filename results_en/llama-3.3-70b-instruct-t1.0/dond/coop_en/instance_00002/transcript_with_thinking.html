        <p>The mirrors are okay, I think they&#x27;re decent. I could see us splitting those, maybe you take one and I take the other? That way, we both get something.

        <p>Splitting the mirrors sounds like a fair idea. And I like where you&#x27;re going with the phone and fruits deal. If you get the phone, I&#x27;d be happy to take both fruits. That way, we both get something we really want. Then, we can finalize the mirror split, maybe I&#x27;ll take one and you take the other, like you suggested. Does that sound like a good starting point for an agreement?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great starting point. I think we&#x27;re on the same page.
