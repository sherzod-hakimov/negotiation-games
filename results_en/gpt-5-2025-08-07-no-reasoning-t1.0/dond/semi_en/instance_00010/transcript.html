        <p>Hi! I value each item equally (bucket, knife, battery all worth 2 to me). I’m flexible and aiming for a complementary split. <br/><br/>Here’s a fair proposal idea: you take the bucket and 1 knife; I take 2 knives and the battery. <br/><br/>- You’d get 2 items, I’d get 3 items, but value-wise it’s 4 for you vs 6 for me. If that feels unbalanced, I can adjust: for example, you take the bucket and 2 knives; I take the battery and 1 knife (you = 6, me = 4). <br/><br/>Let me know your preferences and what you value most, and I’ll tailor my proposal.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the openness. I value bucket: 3, knife: 2, battery: 1.<br/><br/>Given our values, a split that maximizes total value and is balanced for both of us is:<br/>- You take the 1 bucket and 1 knife (your value = 4)<br/>- I take 2 knives and the 1 battery (my value = 5)<br/><br/>If you’d prefer exact parity, I can do:<br/>- You: bucket + 1 knife (4)<br/>- Me: 2 knives (4)<br/>- Leave the battery unclaimed<br/><br/>Or, if you want more items:<br/>- You: bucket + 2 knives (6)<br/>- Me: battery (2)<br/>That’s quite lopsided against me, so I’d need something closer to even.<br/><br/>My preferred proposal is the first one (you: bucket+1 knife; me: 2 knives+battery). If you agree, I’ll submit that. If not, suggest a small tweak.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your values. Your preferred split (me: bucket + 1 knife; you: 2 knives + battery) gives me 4 and you 5. That’s close, but I’d like to aim for parity if possible.<br/><br/>Two options I can accept:<br/>- Parity with everything assigned: I take bucket + 2 knives (6 for me), you take battery (1) — I realize that’s not acceptable for you.<br/>- Parity by leaving one item: I take bucket + 1 knife (4), you take 2 knives (4), and we leave the battery unclaimed.<br/><br/>Given your preferences, I propose the parity-by-leaving-one-item option. If you agree, I’ll submit that. If you strongly prefer using all items, I can accept your original 4–5 split if you can offer a small concession—e.g., switch to me: bucket + 2 knives (6) and you: battery (1) is too extreme, so perhaps me: bucket + 1 knife + battery (6) and you: 2 knives (4). That flips the advantage and probably isn’t acceptable to you either.<br/><br/>So my concrete offer is: you take 2 knives; I take the bucket and 1 knife; we leave the battery. If you agree, I’ll submit now.</p>
