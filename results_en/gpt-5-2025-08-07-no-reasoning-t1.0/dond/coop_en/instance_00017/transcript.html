        <p>Thanks for sharing. I value the pot quite a bit and the magnets moderately; the plate is worthless to me. Your proposal (you: pot + plate, me: 3 magnets) gives me some value but leaves me with less total than you.<br/><br/>How about this instead to boost joint value and keep it fair:<br/>- You take the pot (since you value it most).<br/>- I take the 3 magnets (I get solid value from them).<br/>- The plate can go to you since you care about it and I don’t.<br/><br/>If that matches what you suggested, I’m fine confirming it. If you’d like to balance it further, I’d also be okay with me taking the 3 magnets and the plate (which I don’t value, but it doesn’t hurt), and you take the pot. Let me know which you prefer, and I’ll submit the matching proposal.</p>

        <p>Appreciate the clarity. From my side, I value only the pot and the plate; magnets are worthless to me. So both of your suggested splits give the same total joint value and are fine with me.<br/><br/>To keep it simple and aligned with our preferences, let’s go with:<br/>- I take the pot and the plate.<br/>- You take the 3 magnets.<br/><br/>If you agree, I’ll submit the matching proposal now.</p>
