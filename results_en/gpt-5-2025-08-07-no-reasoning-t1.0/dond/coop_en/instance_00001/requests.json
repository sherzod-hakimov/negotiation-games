I value items as follows (per item): bell 1, doll 2, thread 3. Since threads are my highest value, I propose I take both threads (2 threads), you take the doll (1 doll), and we split the bells 1 each (1 bell each). That gives me value 3+3+1 = 7, and you get at least the doll (2) plus a bell’s value for you (unknown). If you value bells or dolls more, I’m open to adjustments—what are your values?"
