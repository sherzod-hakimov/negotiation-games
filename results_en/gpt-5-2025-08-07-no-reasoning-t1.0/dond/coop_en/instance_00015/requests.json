        "content": "Thanks for laying that out. My values are: statues 0, nail 1, hammer 9. So the hammer is extremely important to me, statues are worthless to me, and the nail is small but positive.\n\nGiven that, the efficient split is:\n- I take the hammer (value 9 to me, 0 to you)\n- You take all 3 statues (value 9 to you, 0 to me)\n- Nail can go to you (value 1 to you, 1 to me). I’m happy for you to have it since it doesn’t change total value.\n\nThis yields total value 19 (you 10, me 9), which is maximal. If you agree, say so and we can both submit accordingly."
