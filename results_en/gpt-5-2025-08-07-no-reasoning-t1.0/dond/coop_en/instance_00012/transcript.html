        <p>Hi! I value items as follows: rulers = 1 each, eggs = 2 each, battery = 3. I’m aiming to maximize our combined total. Could you share how you value each item so we can find a complementary split? If you prefer, propose a division that’s high-value for you; I’ll try to adapt to make sure both proposals can fit.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. Here’s my valuation: rulers = 3 each, eggs = 0 each, battery = 1.<br/><br/>Given that, a split that maximizes our combined total would be:<br/>- You take the battery (worth 3 to you, 1 to me) and the 2 eggs (worth 4 to you, 0 to me).<br/>- I take the 3 rulers (worth 9 to me, 3 to you).<br/><br/>Totals: you get 7, I get 9, combined 16. If that works for you, say so and we can lock complementary proposals. If you prefer a tweak, I could take all 3 rulers and the battery (total 10 to me) while you take the 2 eggs (4 to you), combined 14—but the first split is better overall.</p>
