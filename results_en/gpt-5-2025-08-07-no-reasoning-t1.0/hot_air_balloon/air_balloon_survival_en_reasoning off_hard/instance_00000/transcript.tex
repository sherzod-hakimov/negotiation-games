\texttt{ARGUMENT: \{'I appreciate the concrete options. Between your two paths, option (2) is significantly better for me than option (1) because B33 and C08 are both very strong on my side, and option (1) removes B33 and C08 while adding B20 and C81, which are weaker for me. I can accept adding one of your priorities, but removing both B33 and C08 is too costly. I’ll counter with a set that incorporates one of your adds while preserving my core strength and staying well under the cap, leaving room for a small adjustment if you need it.'\}} \\
