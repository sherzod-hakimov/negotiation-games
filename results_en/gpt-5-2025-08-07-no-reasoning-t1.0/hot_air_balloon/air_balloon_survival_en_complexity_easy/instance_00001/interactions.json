Add C15(31), B12(80)=111, B10(59)=170, A16(157)=327, A30(141)=468, B46(133)=601, A27(204)=805, A89(246)=1051, C92(201)=1252, C81(392)=1644, A08(634)=2278, A66(606)=2884, B94(557)=3441, B67(592)=4033, B45(143)=4176, C12(472)=4648, B00(551)=5199, A58(428)=5627, B60(729)=6356, C34(568)=6924, A84(641)=7565.

Total value compute roughly very high. This is a strong proposal. If opponent resists, I can swap lower-value like B21 not included; we included A05 and B69 late; we can offer to drop A84(641,500) or C34(568,484) to make room for their priorities.
