First, calculate effort of their set (they claim 8689). I’ll compute my importance for each item in their set: C70 968, C34 484, B45 461, A27 822, A84 500, A30 739, A58 457, A89 508, B60 808, B46 606, A66 822, A08 868, A16 856, B09 786, B67 780, B94 783, B12 915, C81 713, C15 781, C12 668. Sum = let’s add: (968+484)=1452; +461=1913; +822=2735; +500=3235; +739=3974; +457=4431; +508=4939; +808=5747; +606=6353; +822=7175; +868=8043; +856=8899; +786=9685; +780=10465; +783=11248; +915=12163; +713=12876; +781=13657; +668=14325. So total importance 14325. Good but maybe we can do better by swapping out items that are relatively low to me per effort. Compute efforts: set efforts sum 8689 (close to limit). Identify low{-}importance items to me: B53=65 (not in set), C06=30 (not in set), B16=3 (not in set), B69=97 (not in set), C92=215, C24=273, A23=262, B75=235, C65=121, B21=138, A05=389, B85=400. In current set, which are relatively low per effort? Maybe A84(500,136), C34(484,54), B45(461,60) actually high per effort. All included are high importance to me. Any I would cut? Perhaps A58(457,252) good; A89(508,262) good. The set is very strong for me already. But effort is 8689, we have only 81 slack. I might try to add C92(164 effort, 215 importance) would exceed. C35(106,444) is huge value with small effort and not in set! Can we swap to include C35. Which item to drop to make room 106 effort; we have 81 slack, so need to free 25 effort. Drop something with low marginal value per effort. Candidates: B45 (461/60 = 7.68 per effort) very good; C34 (484/54=8.96) great; A84 (500/136=3.68); A58 (457/252=1.81); A89 (508/262=1.94); A27 (822/106=7.76); C70 (968/125=7.74). Worst ratios: A58 and A89 and A84. If we add C35 106 effort, we need +25 over slack, so drop something with effort ≥25. The smallest drop could be B45(60) but it’s too valuable. Better swap: drop A58 (252 effort, 457 importance) to add C35 (106, 444), net effort {-}146 leaving more slack, net importance {-}13 (slightly worse). Maybe drop A89 (262,508) to add C35 (106,444): net importance {-}64 worse. Drop A84 (136,500) to add C35 (106,444): net importance {-}56 worse but frees only 30 effort. Alternatively add C35 without drop by swapping a tiny item: we need 25 effort; could drop C34 (54,484) to add C35 (106,444): net importance {-}40 worse. Drop B45 (60,461): net {-}17 worse. So C35 swap seems not improving total importance. What about adding C92 (164,215) if we drop something: e.g., drop A58 (252,457) to add C92: net {-}242 worse. Not good. Maybe add C24 (763,273) terrible. Maybe include B21 (830,138) no. B00 (638,583) not in set; per effort 0.914 but importance 583 is nice; compare to an existing similar{-}effort item with lower importance to me? B46(407,606) is good. B60(324,808) great. A66(517,822) great. A08(607,868) great. Could we replace something like A84(136,500) plus slack to add B00 (638). Need +638{-}81 = 557 additional freed; would have to drop multiple valuable items, likely worse. Their set already looks near Pareto{-}optimal for me. So best strategy: accept quickly to lock in high utility, unless I can ask for a tiny improvement that seems plausible to them. Maybe propose one micro{-}adjustment: swap A58 (252,457) for C35 (106,444). This slightly decreases my own importance by 13, so not good. How about swap A84 (136,500) for C35 (106,444) loses 56. Swap A89 for C35 loses 64. Swap B45 for C35 loses 17. So none are better. Another candidate not included: B10 (116 effort, 623 importance!) Oh wow, B10 is huge value 623 with tiny effort 116 and is not in their set. We should try to include B10. We have 81 slack, need 35 more effort. We can drop the worst per{-}effort item to make room 35 effort minimal loss. Candidates small{-}effort drops: C34(54,484) too much loss; B45(60,461) too much; A84(136,500) dropping frees 136, then can add B10 net importance +123 (623{-}500) and net effort + (116{-}136) = {-}20, still within limit. That’s a strict improvement for me. Or drop A58(252,457) to add B10: net importance +166 (623{-}457) and effort {-}136, even better. So propose modify by adding B10 and dropping A58, which improves my utility and likely also good for them because effort reduces significantly, giving room for any of their needs. New set effort: 8689 {-} 252 + 116 = 8553 ≤ 8770. Keep everything else. This seems strong. I’ll propose this as a small adjustment. If they resist, I can accept their original to secure high value. I’ll include ARGUMENT emphasizing efficiency: frees effort and boosts value. I’ll not reveal my valuations.'\}} \\
