What if we drop C65(143)+B75(23)+A58(307)=473, still short for B00. Add C24(214, not in set) can't—additions must fit. We can swap within total: remove A58(307) and add B85(400,357): net +93 effort; we only have 56 left; so need also drop something else small like B75(23) to free 116 -> new effort would go 7812 -307 -23 +357 = 7839 (still under) and we can keep C65. That improves my value by +400-457-235 = -292; worse. What about adding B00 by removing lower-value but higher effort items: remove C81(713,848) frees 848, could add B00(560,583) and maybe B85(357,400) totaling 917 effort, which is +69 over freed 848; but we also have 56 headroom, total +125, still too much. Alternatively remove C81 and add B00 only: value change +583-713 = -130, worse. Remove B45 isn’t in set. C34 not in set. C35 not in set. C24 (273,214) could be added if we free 214 effort; but we have 56, so need to drop something low value with effort >=158: C65(143) + we still need 15; add B75(23) total 166, still short. If we drop A58(307) we could add C24(214) and B85(357) net effort +264; exceeds headroom. Consider swapping A84(500,231) for C24(273,214): small value drop -227, not good. Overall, their set is already near-ideal for my utility: includes almost all my top-tier items; only potential improvement is swapping out C65(121,143) and B75(235,23) and maybe A58(457,307) to include B00(583,560) but effort doesn’t allow. Any swap likely reduces my total. Best to accept quickly to lock in high utility. To appear collaborative, I’ll endorse and AGREE.'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'This is a strong, efficient package for me as well.

Calculate my importance total and effort for their proposal, then see if I can add more of my high-value items within limit or swap out low-value ones.
