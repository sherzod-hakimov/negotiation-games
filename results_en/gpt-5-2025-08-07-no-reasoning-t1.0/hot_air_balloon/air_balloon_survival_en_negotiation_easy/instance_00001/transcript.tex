	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'We need to maximize my total importance under effort limit 4564. Compute value/effort ratios and knapsack. Items (importance, effort): C42(808,107), A43(868,889), A67(822,967), B42(783,619), C10(780,501), C61(668,565), C55(583,241), A18(484,594), B36(461,139), C73(508,909), C67(389,789), B19(262,978), C43(121,733), A62(65,799), C08(138,299). High ratio standout is C42 (very cheap, high value). Greedy by value likely good: pick top values subject to limit. Try set S1 = {A43, A67, B42, C10, C61, C55, B36, C42}. Effort: 889+967+619+501+565+241+139+107=4028; Importance sum: 868+822+783+780+668+583+461+808=5773. We have remaining capacity 536. Consider adding A18(594) too big; C08(299) fits -> new effort 4327, value +138=5911. Remaining 237 cannot add others except none (C55 already). Maybe replace C08 with C73? 909 too big. With C67(789) too big. C10 already in. Check if we can add something else like C55 already. Any other ≤237? None. So S2 = S1 + C08 seems strong. Could alternative improve by swapping: Try include A18 instead of something: If include A18(594,484) we have to drop something of >=59 effort; maybe drop C08(299,138) net +346 importance +295 effort; 4327-299+594=4622 exceeds. Drop C10(501,780) to add A18? 4028-501+594=4121 value change -296, then can still add C08 4121+299=4420 value 5773-780+484+138=5615 worse. Try adding C73 instead of something: replace C61(565,668) with C73(909,508) bad. Try add C67(789,389) by dropping? Current 4327, need free 789-237=552: drop C08(299)+B36(139)+C55(241)=679 frees, losing 138+461+583=1182 to gain 389 net -793, not good. Try add B19(978,262) impossible beneficial. Therefore S = {A43,A67,B42,C10,C61,C55,B36,C42,C08} seems near-optimal. Effort 4327 within 4564. Keep some flexibility to concede a lower-value item they might want removed; offer strong argument focusing on efficiency: high importance per effort items (C42, C55, B36) and core high-value (A43, A67, C10). Leave small slack (237) for counterpart to add a low-effort item they value, but none exist <=237 besides C55 already picked and B36,C42 included. We could signal willingness to swap C08 for an item they care about if <=237 effort (none), or to trade replacing C61 (565) with their preferred item if needed. Start with firm proposal and argue budget-fit and balance.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A43', 'A67', 'B42', 'C10', 'C61', 'C55', 'B36', 'C42', 'C08'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This set stays safely under the effort limit (total 4327 ≤ 4564) while packing in multiple high-benefit, efficient items. It includes several low-effort, high-impact choices (C42, C55, B36) and maintains strong overall coverage. I’m open to small adjustments if you have a must-have item, but we’ll need to keep within the remaining effort room of 237 or consider a reasonable swap.'}
