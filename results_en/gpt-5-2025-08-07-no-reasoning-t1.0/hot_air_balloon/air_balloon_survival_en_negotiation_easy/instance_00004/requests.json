If we try include C73 instead of A62 and C43 perhaps: current core before small adds has eff 2902. Add C73 848 would exceed 3145 (2902+848=3750) not possible.

Removing A62 and C43 frees 158 effort; still need 386 more, which would require removing something like C55 (118) and B36 (13) and C67 (15) and C42 (94) etc but those are highly valuable per effort; removing a bigger item like C61 (687) would free enough but lose 668 value; net gain would be -668 +484 - maybe plus keep C43/A62 but then exceeds. Try swap C61 out and add A18 and C73? If base without C61 (remove 687 eff and 668 val) and add C73(848,508) and A18(629,484): new eff = 3060 - 687 + 848 + 629 = 3850, too high.

Swap A67 out and add C73 only: eff 3060 -919 +848=2989 val 6348 -822 +508 = 6034, worse. Swap C61 out and add C73 only: eff 3060 -687 +848 = 3221 over limit.

I should try to add A18 (629 effort) but we only have 85 slack; that won’t fit. Next best adds: C73 (848 effort) or B19 (806) also won’t fit; C08 (948) won’t fit.

        "response": "STRATEGIC REASONING: {'My values (importance): C42 808, B36 461, C67 389, C55 583, A43 868, C10 780, B42 783, A67 822, C61 668, C43 121, A62 65, A18 484, C08 138, C73 508, B19 262. Opponent proposed set S uses effort 3060 and includes many of my top items: A43, A67, B42, C10, C42, C55, C61, plus small-cost B36, C67, C43, A62. That set gives me very high total value already. I should try to add A18 (629 effort) but we only have 85 slack; that won’t fit. Next best adds: C73 (848 effort) or B19 (806) also won’t fit; C08 (948) won’t fit. Only small-cost remaining items: C10 already included; C42 included; C43 included; B36 included; C67 included; A62 included. The only remaining small effort item is C10 already in. C61 included. C73, B19, A18, C08 all too big. Therefore, I cannot add anything without removing something. If I swap low-value-to-me items to fit A18, I need 629-85=544 extra. Candidates to drop: A62(111), C43(47), B36(13), C67(15) total 186; still need 358, so would also need to drop one bigger item. Dropping C55(118) totals 304; still short. Drop C10(303) plus smalls would free enough, but C10 is very valuable (780) and A18 is 484, net loss. Perhaps drop C61(687) to add A18(629) and keep smalls: net -58 importance: 484-668=-184, bad. Drop C73 not in set. Drop B42(284) to make room for C73 or A18? For A18 we need 544; if we drop B42 (284) and C55 (118) and A62 (111) and C43 (47) we free 560 to add A18, but we lose 783+583+65+121=1552 to gain 484, very bad. So the proposed set is near-optimal for me. Best strategy: accept quickly to lock in high utility, maybe ask to tweak one tiny item? But there’s no beneficial tweak. Therefore, I should agree immediately to avoid risking a worse counter-proposal.'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'Your proposal already captures nearly all of the most valuable items for me while staying within the limit, and I don’t see a swap that improves things without breaking the effort cap. It’s a strong, efficient set, so I’m ready to finalize.'}\n\nAGREE: {'C42', 'B36', 'C67', 'C55', 'A43', 'C10', 'B42', 'A67', 'C61', 'C43', 'A62'}",
