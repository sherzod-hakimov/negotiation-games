Sum effort = 7328 (given). Sum my importance = 8306. That’s strong. Check if any low-value items could be swapped for very high value/efficiency items not included: B64(924,826), B16(912,814), B95(754,656), B43(702,604), A88(552,454), A94(451,353), C53(420,322), B69(410,312), B19(392,294), A96(304,206), B96(335,237), A75(332,234), A28(329,231), B34(322,224), C82(279,181), A97(248,150), A39(194,96), B15(199,101), C79(159,61), A25(163,65), B37(190,92), B23(252,154), A08(616,518). We only have 23 effort slack (7351-7328). To add anything we must drop something. Candidates to drop with lowest my value per effort: C51 (143,45), A46 (158,60), A71 (552,454). Replacing pair C51+A46 (105 effort) could add up to 105 effort of something like A94(353), B69(312), C53(322). Best combo under ~105: A39(96) + maybe B37(92) too big; So A39(96) + C79(61) would be 157 >105; A25(65)+B15(101)=166 >105; A25(65)+A39(96)=161>105; A97(150) >105. So with dropping only C51+A46 we can add at most one small item under 105: A39(96) or B37(92) or C79(61). Compare values: A39=194, B37=190, C79=159. Current dropped values 143+158=301. Replacing with A39 would be 194 value; net -107. Not good. What if drop A71 (552,454) and add better set totaling <=454+23=477 effort by also utilizing slack if we keep C51,A46. Items we could add within 477: pick high values per effort: A94(353,451) fits; leaves 26 effort useless. Value gain? swap 552 -> 451, we get 451 value vs 552, net -101. Not good. Consider dropping A71 and adding A94(451) plus using dropping also C51 (45) to add A39(96) total capacity 454+45+23=522; add A94(451)+A39(96)=547 >522; If drop A71 and C51 we have 499 capacity (454+45), plus 23 slack =522 as computed. Could add B69(312)+A94(451)=763 >522; C53(322)+A94(451)=773>522; A94(451)+A25(65)=516 fits, value 451+163=614 replacing 552+143=695 net -81. What about dropping A71 and A46 (454+60=514 +23=537) and adding A94(451)+A39(96)=547>537; A94(451)+B37(92)=543>537; A94(451)+C79(61)=512 fits; value 451+159=610 vs dropped 552+158=710 net -100. Try dropping A71 only and adding B69(312)+A39(96)=408 value 410+194=604 vs 552 net +52 but effort 312+96=408 which fits into 454+23=477; but we must also maintain other items unchanged. Yes works: replace A71(454) with B69(312)+A39(96)=408 effort, but we need to also add 96 effort item; we have 23 slack, so total new effort = 7328 -454 + 312 + 96 = 7282. That’s under limit. But we also need to include B69 and A39 which were not in proposal. Is there any conflict? Good. Value change: -552 +410 +194 = +52 improvement to 8358. Even better: replace A71 with B69(312)+B37(92)= value 410+190=600 <552 +48 slack effort 404, improvement +48. A71 -> B69 + A39 best so far. Could we replace A71 with B69 + B15(101)=511 value 410+199=609 (+57) but effort 312+101=413, under 454; value +57 better than +52. Or A71 with B69 + A25(65)=475 value 410+163=573 (+21). Or A71 with B69 + A97(150)=560 (+8) effort 462 exceeds 454 but we have 23 slack: net new effort 7328 -454 + 312 + 150 = 7336 <=7351 OK; Wait replacing with B69 + A97 yields effort increase of 8 relative to dropping A71; allowed by slack 23. So it fits. Value change: -552 +410 +248 = +106! That’s best. Check effort: 7328 -454 +312 +150 = 7336. Under limit. Great. Any even better pair? B69(312) + A39(96) we calculated +52. What about B69 + A75(234)= value 410+332=742 -> +190 but effort 546 increase by 92 > slack 23, but remember only replacing A71(454) with 312+234=546, delta +92 exceeds 23, so violates. B69 + A28(231)=641 value +89 effort 543 delta +89 >23 not allowed. B69 + B96(237)=647 +95 effort +95>23. B69 + B34(224)=734 +180 effort +82>23. B69 + A96(206)=714 +162 effort +64>23. B69 + A08(518)=1026 effort 830 delta +376 >23. Try replace A71 with A94(451) + A97(150) total 601 effort delta +147>23, not allowed without dropping something else small like C51; if also drop C51(45), extra 147-45=102>0 still too big. Best simple change: swap A71 for B69 + A97. New set: original minus A71 plus B69 and A97. Compute total value 8306 -552 +410 +248 = 8412. Good. Keep anchor big C items.

To improve balance while staying under 7351, I suggest a small swap: replace A71 with B69 and A97. Effort stays within limit (new total 7336), and we add two mid-effort items instead of one, which should make it easier for both of us to capture value.

Combined value of B69+A97 = 658 vs A71 = 552, with efforts 312+150=462 vs 454. Their proposal increases my total importance by +106 and stays within effort (7336). This is strictly better for me, so I should accept immediately to secure agreement rather than risk renegotiation. Ensure it’s within limit: my original 7328 - 454 + 312 + 150 = 7336 ≤ 7351. Proceed to AGREE to lock in.'}\n\nAGREE: {'C72', 'C83', 'A87', 'C60', 'C84', 'C10', 'A65', 'C17', 'C51', 'A46', 'B69', 'A97'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'Agreed—your swap improves balance while keeping us under the limit at a total effort of 7336.
