Key high{-}value items: A71(868,831), A10(808,691), C00(822,111), C01(780,766), B35(783,926), B41(583,291), B86(668,304), C54(508,583), B32(484,559), A87(461,14), A03(262,25), A04(121,121), C17(138,210), B33(389,989), A77(65,827). Greedy shortlist: definitely include C00 and A87 and A03 (huge value, tiny effort). Build a high{-}importance set under 3624. Try set S1 = \{A71,A10,C00,C01,B35,B41,B86,C54,B32,A87,A03\}. Effort: 831+691+111+766+926+291+304+583+559+14+25 = 5101 > limit. Trim.

We have 32 effort room; can we add anything ≤32? None besides already included small items; A04=121 too big. Maybe swap B32(559,484) for C54(583,508) costs +24 effort +24 value; new effort 3592{-}559+583=3616 still ≤3624, value +24 {-}> 5780. New set: \{A71,A10,C00,C01,B41,B86,C54,A87,A03\}. Effort check: 831+691+111+766+291+304+583+14+25=3616 correct. Try also adding C17(210,138) would exceed. Could we swap B41(291,583) for something? B41 is very efficient; keep. Consider adding A04(121,121) would exceed by 121{-}? We have 8 slack only; so cannot add. Check replacing C54 with B32? We just calculated C54 better by +24 value for +24 effort; keep C54. Consider B35(926,783) by dropping A10(691,808) + C54(583,508) (total eff 1274, val 1316) to add 926,783 and maybe something else with freed 348 effort: plus C17(210,138) and A04(121,121) total 926+210+121=1257 effort≤1274; value 783+138+121=1042 < 1316, worse. Replace A71? No, A71 is very high. Replace C01? No. So the set seems near{-}optimal given big items chosen. Propose this strong set first, argue efficiency and closeness to limit.

Check if I can marginally improve by swapping as they suggested: replacing C54(583, val 508) with B32(559, val 583) keeps effort 3616{-}583+559=3592 and increases my value by +75 to 3692, which is better. Ensure limit okay: 3592 ≤ 3624. Any other improvements possible within cap? Could I add something extra after the swap? Remaining slack would be 3624{-}3592=32, only items ≤32 effort: A03 is 25 but already included; A87 is 14 already included; no new items ≤32. Consider also swapping A71 (low value 65, high effort 831) for something: if we drop A71, we free 831, new effort 2761, we could add B32 and C54 both, but B32 already added in swap; add high{-}value items: A77(827,868) + A04(121,822) seems too much; 2761 + 827 + 121 = 3709 > limit. Try A77 only: 2761+827=3588, we’d have set without A71 but with C54 original? Let's recompute from original: If we replace A71 with A77 keeping others same: effort 3616 {-} 831 + 827 = 3612 ≤ limit; value change +868 {-} 65 = +803 {-}> new total 3617 + 803 = 4420, huge. That seems very good for me. Check any conflicts? They proposed A71; I propose swapping to A77 could be acceptable to them? Unknown. Maybe offer a counter{-}proposal that swaps in both my best improvements: replace A71 with A77, and replace C54 with B32. Effort: original 3616 {-} 831 + 827 {-} 583 + 559 = 3588; value: 3617 {-} 65 + 868 {-} 508 + 583 = 4495. 3588 leaves 36 slack; cannot add more. This is my optimal local move. Ensure all items exist: yes. I should respond with a REFUSE of their proposal and a new PROPOSAL including A77 and B32 swaps, with an ARGUMENT referencing staying under limit and improving balance/efficiency. Also keep tone collaborative and mention their own suggested B32 swap to show alignment.'\}} \\

                \texttt{STRATEGIC REASONING: \{'They’re pushing to replace A71 with either A04 or C17. For me, A71 is extremely valuable (868). A04 (121) and C17 (138) are vastly worse for me, even if they save effort, and we don’t need the saved capacity because our previous set already fit the limit. I should firmly reject substituting A71 with A04 or C17. I can keep the concession of B32 over C54. To move forward, I’ll re{-}propose my last acceptable set with A71 included: \{A71, A10, C00, C01, B41, B86, B32, A87, A03\} (3592). As a conciliatory option if they demand something extra, I could offer adding A04 by removing A03 (net +96 effort, still under 3624? 3592 {-}25 +121 = 3688, that exceeds; so not possible). Maybe swap B41(291) for C17(210) to make room for A04? That frees 81, but still short by 15 (need 96). Swap B41 for A04 directly? 3592 {-}291 +121 = 3422; value loss for me but keeps A71. If necessary, I can propose an alternate with A71 kept and replace B41 with A04 to show flexibility. For now, I’ll first refuse and restate the A71{-}keeping set. I’ll argue we’re already under the cap and that replacing A71 with a tiny item harms balance. I’ll invite them to name one must{-}have swap not involving A71, and hint I can consider B41→A04 if needed.'\}} \\
