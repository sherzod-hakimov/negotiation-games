        <p>That&#x27;s great to hear! It sounds like we might have complementary preferences. The brick is by far the most valuable item to me, and I&#x27;m also somewhat interested in the knives since you mentioned they&#x27;re not particularly useful to you. The mirrors and comb are less important to me.<br/><br/>So it seems like a good division might be: you get the comb and mirrors (since those are valuable to you), and I get the brick and knives (since the brick is very important to me and you don&#x27;t need the knives). Does this sound fair to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent division! You&#x27;re absolutely right that our preferences seem very complementary. I would be very happy with getting the comb and mirrors, and it makes perfect sense for you to take the brick that&#x27;s so valuable to you plus the knives that I don&#x27;t really need.<br/><br/>This arrangement should maximize both of our scores since we&#x27;re each getting the items we value most.
