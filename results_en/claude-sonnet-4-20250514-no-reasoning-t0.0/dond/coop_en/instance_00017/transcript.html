        <p>That&#x27;s great information! I actually value the pot and plate quite highly, while the magnets have no value to me at all. It sounds like we might have complementary preferences - you value the pot and magnets, while I value the pot and plate.<br/><br/>Since we both value the pot highly, that might be the trickiest item to allocate. How much do you value the pot compared to getting all 3 magnets? This could help us figure out the best way to split things.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s a great question and really helpful for finding the optimal split! <br/><br/>The pot is worth 4 points to me, while all 3 magnets together would be worth 6 points to me (2 points each). So actually, I would prefer to take all 3 magnets rather than the pot, even though I value the pot highly.<br/><br/>Given that you value both the pot and plate highly, and the magnets have no value to you, it seems like an efficient split would be for you to take the pot and plate, while I take all 3 magnets. This way we both get items we value and avoid competing over the pot.<br/><br/>Does this arrangement work well for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a perfect arrangement! You&#x27;re absolutely right - if you get all 3 magnets (worth 6 points to you) and I get the pot and plate (worth 10 points to me), we&#x27;re both getting items we value highly and maximizing our combined score.<br/><br/>This split makes complete sense since the magnets have no value to me, and you&#x27;ve indicated you&#x27;d actually prefer the 3 magnets over the pot. Meanwhile, the plate has no value to you but high value to me.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m ready to make this our agreement: you take all 3 magnets, I take the pot and plate. Should we both submit our proposals now?<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]</p>

        <p>Based on our discussion, the other player values the pot and plate highly while the magnets have no value to them. I value the magnets moderately and the pot highly, but all 3 magnets together (6 points) are worth more to me than the pot (4 points). The plate has no value to me.<br/><br/>The optimal split appears to be: they get the pot and plate (their high-value items), and I get all 3 magnets.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 3 magnet]</p>
