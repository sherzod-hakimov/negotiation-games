You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

        <p>Hello! I&#x27;d be happy to work together on this. The flower is quite valuable to me, and I have some interest in the pen as well. The frames are less important to me personally. What about you - which items do you find most valuable? If we can understand each other&#x27;s preferences, we should be able to find a division that works well for both of us.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s great to hear! It sounds like we have complementary preferences, which should work well for both of us. The pen is actually quite valuable to me, and I&#x27;m also interested in the frames. The flower isn&#x27;t particularly important to me, so I&#x27;d be happy for you to have that.<br/><br/>Based on what you&#x27;ve shared, it seems like you&#x27;d prefer the flower and possibly the pen, while the frames matter less to you. For me, the pen and frames are more valuable. Would you be open to a division where you take the flower and I take the pen and all 3 frames? Or would you prefer to keep some frames as well?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a very reasonable division! Since the flower is most valuable to me and the pen and frames are more valuable to you, it makes perfect sense for you to take the pen and all 3 frames while I take the flower. This way we&#x27;re both getting the items we value most.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m happy to agree to this arrangement - you get the pen and 3 frames, I get the flower.
