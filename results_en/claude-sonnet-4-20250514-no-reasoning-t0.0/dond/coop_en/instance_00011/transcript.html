        <p>Hello! I&#x27;d be happy to work together to find the best division. I&#x27;m most interested in the ring - it&#x27;s quite valuable to me. The fruits and chalk are less important to me.

If you&#x27;re not as interested in the ring, perhaps we can find a good arrangement where I take that and you get the items that matter more to you.</p>

        <p>That works out perfectly! The ring isn&#x27;t as valuable to me as it is to you, so I&#x27;m happy for you to take it. I&#x27;m more interested in the fruits and chalk. Since you mentioned those are less important to you, how about this arrangement: you take the ring, and I take the 3 fruits and 1 chalk? This way we both get the items we value most. Does this sound fair to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent arrangement! You&#x27;re absolutely right - this division gives us both exactly what we value most. You get the fruits and chalk which are more important to you, and I get the ring which is most valuable to me. This should maximize our combined score perfectly.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 ring]</p>
