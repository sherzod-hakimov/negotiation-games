        <p>Hello! I&#x27;m most interested in the clocks - they&#x27;re quite valuable to me. The potatoes have some value too, but less so. The papers don&#x27;t matter much to me at all. What about you - which items do you value most?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s great to hear! It sounds like we might have complementary preferences. I&#x27;m actually most interested in the potatoes - they have the highest value to me. The papers and clocks are less important to me. <br/><br/>Since you value the clocks highly and I value the potatoes highly, how about you take both clocks and I take both potatoes? That leaves us with 4 papers to split - we could each take 2 papers. Does that sound fair to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent arrangement! You&#x27;re right that our preferences seem very complementary. I&#x27;m happy with you taking both potatoes since they&#x27;re most valuable to you, and I&#x27;ll take both clocks since they&#x27;re most valuable to me. Splitting the 4 papers equally with 2 each makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>So to confirm: you get 2 potatoes and 2 papers, I get 2 clocks and 2 papers. This seems like a win-win solution!<br/><br/>[Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 papers]</p>

        <p>Based on our conversation, the other player values clocks most and papers least, while I value potatoes most. They seemed agreeable to the split we discussed where they get both clocks, I get both potatoes, and we split the papers.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 2 papers, 0 clocks, 2 potatoes]</p>
