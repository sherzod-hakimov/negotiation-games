        <p>Since you&#x27;re particularly interested in the bucket, I&#x27;m happy to let you have it! All the items have equal value to me, so I&#x27;m very flexible. How about you take the bucket, and we split the other items? For instance, you could have the bucket plus maybe 1 knife, and I could take the remaining 2 knives and the battery? Does that sound fair to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds very reasonable! I appreciate you being so accommodating about the bucket. Your suggestion of me getting the bucket plus 1 knife while you take 2 knives and the battery seems like a fair split to me. Should we go with that arrangement?</p>
