You're right that getting something is better than both of us getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement.\n\nWhile the frame would be my preference, I can see you also really need it. Given that you're offering me the shoe and all 3 hammers, and considering we need to reach an agreement, I think I can accept that arrangement. It's not ideal for me, but it's reasonable given our situation.\n\nSo to confirm: you would take the frame, and I would get the shoe and all 3 hammers. Does that sound right to you?\n\n[Proposal: 1 shoe, 3 hammers]",
