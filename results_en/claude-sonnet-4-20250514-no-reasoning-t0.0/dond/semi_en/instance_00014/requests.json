While I do value the frame, I want to make sure we both feel good about the deal.

The shoe plus 3 hammers would only be worth about 4 units to me, while the frame alone would be worth 6.\n\nHowever, I recognize you also value the frame highly. Could you share a bit about how you value these items? Maybe if I understood your preferences better, we could find a split that works well for both of us. For instance, are there particular hammers or the shoe that you'd want along with the frame, or are you mainly focused on just getting the frame?"

Since you mentioned the frame is worth 6 units to you and the shoe plus hammers would be 4 units, while I really need the frame too... \n\nWhat if I took the frame and you got the shoe and all 3 hammers? I know it's not your ideal outcome, but at least you'd get something valuable rather than risk us both getting nothing if we can't agree. Would that work for you, or do you have another suggestion?"
