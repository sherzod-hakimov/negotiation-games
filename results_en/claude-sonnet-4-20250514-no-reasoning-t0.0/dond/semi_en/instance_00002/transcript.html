        <p>Hi! Thanks for starting the conversation. I&#x27;m most interested in the glasses actually - I&#x27;d love to get all 3 of them if possible. The shovel sounds perfect for you! What about the berries and bowl? Do you have any preference between those two?</p>

        <p>That works out great! Since you want all 3 glasses and I want the shovel, we&#x27;re off to a good start. As for the berries and bowl, I don&#x27;t have a strong preference between them - they&#x27;re about the same to me. Since you&#x27;re getting the glasses which seem valuable to you, would you like to take either the berries or the bowl as well? I&#x27;m happy with just the shovel if that makes the split feel fair to you.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s very generous of you! Since you&#x27;re being so accommodating, I think it would be fair if I just take the 3 glasses and you get the shovel, bowl, and both berries. That way you get more items overall since I&#x27;m getting all the glasses I wanted. Does that split sound good to you?</p>
