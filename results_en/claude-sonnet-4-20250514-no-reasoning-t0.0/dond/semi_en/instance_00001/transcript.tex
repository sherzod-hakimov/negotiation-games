The flower is nice but not as important to me. Since we both want the shovel, maybe we could work out a trade? What if I take the shovel and you get the flower plus some magnets to make it fair?

	 I appreciate your openness about your priorities! Since the shovel is your top priority and the flower is my main interest, that could work well. However, since we both value the shovel, I'd need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me to give it up. What if you take the shovel and 2 magnets, and I get the flower and the remaining 2 magnets? Does that seem fair to you?
