        <p>That&#x27;s great to hear! The pictures are actually quite appealing to me, so it sounds like we might have complementary preferences. Since you&#x27;re most interested in the orange and pepper, and I&#x27;d be happy to take the pictures, would you be open to a split where you get the orange and pepper, and I take all 3 pictures? Does that seem fair to you?</p>
