	 Yes, that's exactly right - without the shell, any combination of shovels and pictures would leave me with essentially nothing of value. And I can hear that the shell is extremely valuable to you too, more than all the other items combined.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is quite a dilemma since we both need the shell and there's only one. I've been thinking about this, and I realize that if neither of us is willing to give up the shell, we might both end up with nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given how essential the shell is to both of us, and that you do see some value in the other items while I see none, I'm wondering if there's really any path forward here. What do you think - are we at an impasse, or do you see any other possibilities?\\ \tt \\ \tt [Proposal: 1 shell]

	 Looking at this situation, the other player has made it very clear that:\\ \tt 1. They have no use for shovels or pictures at all\\ \tt 2. Only the shell has value to them\\ \tt 3. Without the shell, any other combination would be worthless to them\\ \tt \\ \tt Given my values (shovel: 1, picture: 1, shell: 5), I need to consider:\\ \tt - If I insist on the shell, the other player gets nothing of value and might propose something that leads to both of us getting zero\\ \tt - The shell is worth 5 to me, while all shovels and pictures combined are worth 5 (3×1 + 2×1 = 5)\\ \tt - If they truly value only the shell and I can get everything else, this could still be a reasonable outcome\\ \tt \\ \tt Since they seem determined to only accept the shell, and a failed negotiation gives us both zero, I should probably accept their implied trade.\\ \tt \\ \tt [Proposal: 3 shovels, 2 pictures]
