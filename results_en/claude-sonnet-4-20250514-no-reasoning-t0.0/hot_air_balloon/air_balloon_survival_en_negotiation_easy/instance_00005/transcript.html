        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I need to analyze the value-to-effort ratio for each item to maximize my benefit within the 3170 effort limit. Let me calculate importance/effort ratios: C42(4.70), A18(2.92), C55(4.94), C61(5.61), B19(1.36), A62(1.59), C10(1.30), B42(0.97), A43(1.03), C67(0.84), A67(0.91), C73(0.63), B36(1.07), C43(0.49), C08(0.33).

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Let me analyze this proposal. The other player proposed: C61, C55, C42, A18, A62, B19, C43. Let me calculate the total effort: 119+118+172+166+41+193+246 = 1055 effort (they said 1059 but close enough). This leaves 3170-1055 = 2115 effort remaining. Now let me check my importance values for their proposal: C61(668) + C55(583) + C42(808) + A18(484) + A62(65) + B19(262) + C43(121) = 2991 total importance. This is actually quite good for me! However, I should check if I can do better by including some of my highest importance items that they left out. My top items are: A43(868), A67(822), C10(780), but these have high effort costs of 846, 907, 601 respectively. I could potentially negotiate to swap some lower importance items in their proposal for higher importance ones, but I need to be careful not to reveal my values.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your proposal covers good diversity across categories, but I think we might be able to optimize better given we have significant effort budget remaining. Some of the items you selected might not provide the best value ratio.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The other player thinks we can optimize better and mentions value ratios, suggesting they are also thinking about efficiency. They didn&#x27;t make a counter-proposal, so they want me to adjust. Since I have 2111 effort remaining (3170-1059), I can add some higher-effort, high-importance items. I should add A43 (868 importance, 846 effort) and C10 (780 importance, 601 effort) which are very valuable to me, and maybe B42 (783 importance, 809 effort).
