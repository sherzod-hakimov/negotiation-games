</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.</li>
<li>The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: 'W', 'I', 'T', 'C', 'H'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:</li>
<li><code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code>: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.</li>
<li><code>MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)</code>: to move an object to a new position, where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the column and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.</li>
<li>If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.</li>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code> command!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game</strong></p>
<p>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p>Both players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<p>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p></p>

<p>Current positions:
- H is at (1,1)
- C is at (4,1)
- T is at (7,3)
- W is at (3,5)
- I is at (4,6)</p>
<p>The other player suggests arranging them alphabetically in the top row:
- C at (1,1)
- H at (2,1)
- I at (3,1)
- T at (4,1)
- W at (5,1)</p>
<p>This seems like a reasonable plan. Let me check if these target positions are available on my board. Looking at row 1:
- (1,1) currently has H
- (2,1) has ◌ (empty)
- (3,1) has ◌ (empty)
- (4,1) currently has C
- (5,1) would be outside the visible grid boundary... wait let me recheck.</p>
<p>Looking at the grid again:</p>
<pre><code> 1234567
╔═╤═╤═╤═╗
║H│◌│◌│C║ 1
</code></pre>
<p>So the top row goes from columns 1 to 4, not 1 to 7. The grid seems to be 4 columns wide, not 7. Let me reread...</p>
<p>The grid is definitively 4 columns wide. The proposed alphabetical arrangement won't work as suggested. I'll need to modify the plan to fit within the available columns, ensuring each letter can be moved to an open space.</p></p>

<pre><code>║C│H│◌│◌║ 1

<p>Position (2,1) contains "H" currently, but I need to check (2,2). Actually wait, looking more carefully:

- (3,1) = ◌

<p>But according to our plan:

- I at (3,1) 
- T at (4,1)
- W at (1,2)</p>
<p>Wait, let me re-read the grid. H is currently at (3,1). I want to move H to (2,1). Looking at row 1: ║C│H│◌│◌║
So (2,1) currently contains H. That means H is already at (2,1)? Let me reread...</p>
<p>Actually looking at the coordinates again:
║C│H│◌│◌║ 1
This means:
- (1,1) = C

<ul>
<li>(3,1) = ◌</li>

<p>Looking at row 1: ║C│H│◌│◌║
Position (4,1) looks empty (◌), so I should move H there first since that's where T needs to go eventually. Actually, let me think about this more systematically.</p>
<p>I need to move I to (3,1), but H is there. So I need to move H somewhere else first. Looking at the grid, (4,1) appears to be empty, so I can move H there temporarily.</p></p>

<p>I need to move H from (2,1) to make room for I at (3,1), but I need to be careful about where I move H. Looking at the target plan:
- C at (1,1) ✓ done
- H at (2,1) ✓ but it needs to move to let I go to (3,1) first
- I at (3,1) 
- T at (4,1)
- W at (1,2)</p>
<p>Wait, I'm confused about the plan. Let me re-read: "C at (1,1), H at (2,1), I at (3,1), T at (4,1), and W at (1,2)"</p>
<p>Actually, H should be at (2,1), but I need to move it temporarily to place I at (3,1) first, then move H back. But (2,1) has a line symbol.</p>
<p>Let me look more carefully at what positions are actually available in row 1:
- (1,1) has C
- (2,1) has "│" - this is a line, not empty!
- (3,1) has H
- (4,1) has "│" - this is a line, not empty!</p>
<p>I realized the grid's border lines are creating confusion about available spaces. The actual empty positions are more limited than I initially thought. I'll need to carefully examine the grid's true open spots to plan my next move strategically.</p></p>

- Row 3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) have '◌', (5,3), (6,3) have '◌'

<p>Wait, let me re-read the current plan. We agreed on:

The other player sent this message:</p>
<p>"Are all your pieces in the target positions? C(1,1), H(3,1), I(1,3), T(2,3), W(3,3)?"</p>
<p>What is your next command?</p></p>

        <p><p>Let me check my current positions against the target positions:</p>
<p>Target positions: C(1,1), H(3,1), I(1,3), T(2,3), W(3,3)</p>
<p>Current positions on my board:
- C at (1,1) ✓
- H at (2,1) (I just moved H to (3,1) but the board shows it at (2,1)?) - Wait, let me re-read. The board shows "║C│H│◌│◌║ 1" which means C is at (1,1) and H is at (2,1), not (3,1). But the move said it was successful to (3,1). Let me look more carefully.</p>
<p>Actually, looking at the board display:</p>
<pre><code> 1234567
╔═╤═╤═╤═╗
║C│H│◌│◌║ 1
║◌└─┼─┴─╢ 2
║IW◌│◌◌◌║ 3
</code></pre>
<p>The columns are 1,2,3,4 and H is in the second column, so H is at (2,1). But I tried to move H to (3,1). There seems to be an inconsistency.</p>
<p>Wait, let me look at the target again: H(3,1). But (3,1) shows as "◌", so H is not at (3,1). H is at (2,1).</p>
<p>Current positions:
- C at (1,1) ✓ - matches target
- H at (2,1) - target is (3,1) ✗
- I at (1,3) ✓ - matches target<br />
- W at (2,3) - target is (3,3) ✗
- T at (4,7) - target is (2,3) ✗</p>
<p>So I need to move:</p>
<p>I'll strategically relocate pieces to match the target configuration. The tricky part is T's destination, which currently hosts W. I'll need to carefully sequence the moves to avoid conflicts.</p></p>
