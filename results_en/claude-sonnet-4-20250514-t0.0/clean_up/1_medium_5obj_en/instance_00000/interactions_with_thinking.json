Actually wait, looking more carefully:\n- (1,1) = C\n- (2,1) = H  \n- (3,1) = \u25cc\n- (4,1) = \u25cc\n\nBut according to our plan:\n- C at (1,1) \u2713\n- H at (2,1) - but H is currently at (3,1), and (2,1) looks like it has some grid element\n- I at (3,1) \n- T at (4,1)\n- W at (1,2)\n\nWait, let me re-read the grid. H is currently at (3,1). I want to move H to (2,1). Looking at row 1: \u2551C\u2502H\u2502\u25cc\u2502\u25cc\u2551\nSo (2,1) currently contains H. That means H is already at (2,1)? Let me reread...\n\nActually looking at the coordinates again:\n\u2551C\u2502H\u2502\u25cc\u2502\u25cc\u2551 1\nThis means:\n- (1,1) = C\n- (2,1) = H\n\n\n- (3,1) = \u25cc\n- (4,1) = \u25cc\n\nH is indeed at (2,1), which matches the target position.

The board shows \"\u2551C\u2502H\u2502\u25cc\u2502\u25cc\u2551 1\" which means C is at (1,1) and H is at (2,1), not (3,1). But the move said it was successful to (3,1). Let me look more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the board display:\n```\n 1234567\n\u2554\u2550\u2564\u2550\u2564\u2550\u2564\u2550\u2557\n\u2551C\u2502H\u2502\u25cc\u2502\u25cc\u2551 1\n\u2551\u25cc\u2514\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2562 2\n\u2551IW\u25cc\u2502\u25cc\u25cc\u25cc\u2551 3\n```\n\nThe columns are 1,2,3,4 and H is in the second column, so H is at (2,1). But I tried to move H to (3,1). There seems to be an inconsistency.\n\nWait, let me look at the target again: H(3,1). But (3,1) shows as \"\u25cc\", so H is not at (3,1). H is at (2,1).\n\nCurrent positions:\n- C at (1,1) \u2713 - matches target\n- H at (2,1) - target is (3,1) \u2717\n- I at (1,3) \u2713 - matches target  \n- W at (2,3) - target is (3,3) \u2717\n- T at (4,7) - target is (2,3) \u2717\n\nSo I need to move:\n\n\nI'll strategically relocate pieces to match the target configuration.
