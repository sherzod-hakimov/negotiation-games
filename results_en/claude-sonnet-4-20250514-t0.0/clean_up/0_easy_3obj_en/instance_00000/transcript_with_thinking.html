<ul>
<li>The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.</li>
<li>The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: 'C', 'L', 'P'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:</li>
<li><code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code>: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.</li>
<li><code>MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)</code>: to move an object to a new position, where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the column and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.</li>
<li>If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 8 penalties, you both lose the game.</li>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code> command!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game</strong></p>
<p>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p>Both players win if the game ends within 12 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<p>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p></p>

<p>The other player has the same objects (C, L, P) but at different positions on their board. We need to agree on a common target configuration and then both move our objects to those positions.</p>
<p>I should start by greeting the other player and proposing a strategy for where we should place the objects.</p></p>

<p>Let me check the suggested targets:
- L at (2,1): Looking at row 1, column 2 - that's where there's a "│" symbol, so that's not empty
- P at (3,6): Looking at row 6, column 3 - that appears to be "◌", so that should be empty
- C at (6,6): Looking at row 6, column 6 - that appears to be "◌", so that should be empty</p>
<p>So (2,1) won't work because there's a line there. Let me suggest better positions.</p></p>

<p>You are currently playing round 8 of maximum 12.

The other player sent this message:</p>
<p>"Perfect! All objects are now at our agreed target positions - L at (1,5), P at (3,6), and C at (6,6). Great teamwork!"</p>
<p>What is your next command?</p></p>

        <p><p>The other player has said "finished!" and now they're confirming that all objects are at the agreed target positions. Since they said "finished!" and I replied "finished!" the game should be ending now. I should wait to see if the game master declares the game over, but if I need to respond, I should acknowledge the successful completion.</p>
<p>Actually, looking back at the rules:
"If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end."</p>
<p>I asked "Finished?" and they replied "finished!" and I replied "finished!" so the game should have already ended. But the game master is still asking for my next command and showing the other player sent another message. I should just acknowledge their message.</p></p>

        <p><p>It seems like the game should have already ended when both players said "finished!" but it's still continuing. Let me check what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round 6: Other player asked "Finished?"</li>
<li>Round 7: I replied "finished!"</li>
<li>The other player also sent "finished!" </li>
</ul>
<p>According to the rules: "If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end."</p>
<p>It seems like both players have agreed to finish, but the game is still going. Maybe the game master needs a specific confirmation or there's still something that needs to be done. Since we're still in the game, I should probably wait or ask for confirmation that the game has ended.</p></p>

        <p><p>The other player already said "finished!" and I replied with "finished!" as well. The game should have ended when I said "finished!" in response to their "finished!" message. But the game seems to be continuing. Let me check the rules again:</p>

<p>The other player said "finished!" (not "finished?") and I replied with "finished!". According to the rules, the game should have ended there.
