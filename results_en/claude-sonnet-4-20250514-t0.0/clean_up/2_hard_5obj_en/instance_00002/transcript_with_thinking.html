<pre><code> 1234567

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.</li>
<li>The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: 'W', 'I', 'T', 'C', 'H'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:</li>
<li><code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code>: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.</li>
<li><code>MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)</code>: to move an object to a new position, where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the column and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.</li>
<li>If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.</li>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code> command!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game</strong></p>
<p>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p>Both players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<p>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p></p>

        <p><p>Great! The other player already has all their objects in the target positions, so I need to move mine to match. Let me check what moves I need to make:</p>
<p>Current positions on my board:
- W at (2,3) → needs to go to (1,3)
- C at (2,4) → needs to go to (2,6) 
- I at (4,5) → needs to go to (4,2)

- T at (3,7) → needs to go to (1,1)</p>
<p>Let me start with one move. I need to check that the target positions are empty (contain ◌).</p>
<p>Looking at the board:
- (1,3): This shows ║◌│W│◌│◌║ so position (1,3) appears to be empty (◌)
- (2,6): This shows ║◌H◌└─┬─╢ so position (2,6) appears to have H, but wait, that's where H currently is. Actually let me re-read the board more carefully.</p>
<p>Looking at row 6: ║◌H◌└─┬─╢ 
The H is at position (2,6) currently, so if I want to move C to (2,6), I need to move H first.</p>
<p>Let me start by moving T from (3,7) to (1,1). Looking at position (1,1): ║◌│◌│◌│◌║ - yes, (1,1) is empty.</p></p>

<p>Let me re-check the coordinates. The target for I is (4,2). Looking at column 4, row 2... that would be the 4th column from the left and 2nd row from the top. In the grid, that's indeed where there's a '┤' character.</p>

<p>Looking at row 5, I can see I is at position (4,5), and (5,5) and (6,5) both appear to be empty (◌). So I should be able to move I from (4,5) to (5,5). But the system says (5,5) is not empty and contains 'I'. That's strange...</p>
<p>Wait, let me recount the coordinates. Looking at the grid:
- Row 5: ╟─┴─┤I◌◌║
- Columns: 1234567</p>
<p>So position (4,5) has 'I', position (5,5) has '◌', and position (6,5) has '◌'. So (5,5) should be empty. But the system says it contains 'I'. </p>
<p>Maybe I miscounted. Let me be more careful:
Row 5: ╟─┴─┤I◌◌║
Column: 1234567</p>
<p>Position 1: ╟
Position 2: ─
Position 3: ┴
Position 4: ─</p>
<p>Position 5: ┤
Position 6: I
Position 7: ◌</p>
<p>I'm encountering a perplexing coordinate discrepancy. The grid shows I at (4,5), but the system insists I is at (5,5). The penalty message explicitly states "(5,5) is not empty, but contains 'I'". This suggests a fundamental mismatch between the visual representation and the underlying coordinate system. I need to carefully verify the exact location and understand why there's such a clear contradiction.</p></p>
