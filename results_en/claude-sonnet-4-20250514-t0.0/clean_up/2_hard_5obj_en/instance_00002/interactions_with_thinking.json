You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.\n\n\n**Goal:**\n\nBoth players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.\n\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:\n 1. `SAY: <MESSAGE>`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.\n2. `MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)`: to move an object to a new position, where `<X>` is the column and `<Y>` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.\n* If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.\n* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: <MESSAGE>` command!\n\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '\u25cc'.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n\n\n**End of Game**\n\nIf you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.\n\nBoth players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nThe closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!",

Looking at the grid:\n- Row 5: \u255f\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2524I\u25cc\u25cc\u2551\n- Columns: 1234567\n\nSo position (4,5) has 'I', position (5,5) has '\u25cc', and position (6,5) has '\u25cc'. So (5,5) should be empty. But the system says it contains 'I'. \n\nMaybe I miscounted. Let me be more careful:\nRow 5: \u255f\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2524I\u25cc\u25cc\u2551\nColumn: 1234567\n\nPosition 1: \u255f\nPosition 2: \u2500\nPosition 3: \u2534\nPosition 4: \u2500\n\n\nPosition 5: \u2524\nPosition 6: I\nPosition 7: \u25cc\n\nI'm encountering a perplexing coordinate discrepancy. The grid shows I at (4,5), but the system insists I is at (5,5). The penalty message explicitly states \"(5,5) is not empty, but contains 'I'\". This suggests a fundamental mismatch between the visual representation and the underlying coordinate system. I need to carefully verify the exact location and understand why there's such a clear contradiction.",
