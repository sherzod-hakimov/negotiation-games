</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.</li>
<li>The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: 'P', 'O', 'T', 'S', 'D', 'A', 'M'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:</li>
<li><code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code>: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.</li>
<li><code>MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)</code>: to move an object to a new position, where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the column and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.</li>
<li>If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 16 penalties, you both lose the game.</li>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code> command!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game</strong></p>
<p>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p>Both players win if the game ends within 28 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<p>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p></p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (GridCleaner) to Player 1 (GridCleaner)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p><p>Looking at the game board, I can see the positions of the objects:

- M at (3,3) 
- S at (6,4)
- T at (5,6)
- P at (4,6)
- O at (6,6)
- D at (2,7)</p>
<p>The goal is to coordinate with the other player so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates on both boards. Since I can't see their board, I need to communicate with them to agree on target positions for each object.</p>
<p>I should start by introducing myself and suggesting we share our current object positions, then agree on target positions.</p></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (GridCleaner) to Player 2 (GridCleaner)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p><p>Let me first analyze my current board to see where my objects are positioned:</p>
<p>Looking at the grid:</p>
<pre><code> 1234567
╔═╤═╤═╤═╗
║◌│◌│◌│◌║ 1
╟─┴─┼─┤◌║ 2
║◌M◌│◌└─╢ 3

║O◌◌◌◌┌─╢ 5
║◌D◌◌A│S║ 6
║◌◌◌◌T│◌║ 7
╚═════╧═╝
</code></pre>
<p>Let me identify the positions:
- M is at position (2, 3)
- P is at position (5, 4)<br />
- O is at position (1, 5)
- D is at position (2, 6)
- A is at position (5, 6)
- S is at position (6, 6)
- T is at position (5, 7)</p>
<p>The other player's positions are:
- A(7,1) - but wait, that's outside the grid! The grid only goes to column 7, but A is at (7,1), which would be the rightmost column in row 1. Let me double-check the coordinate system.</p>
<p>Looking at the coordinate system again:
- x-coordinates are columns 1-7 (left to right)
- y-coordinates are rows 1-7 (top to bottom)</p>
<p>So A(7,1) means column 7, row 1. Let me check if that's possible - looking at row 1, column 7 would be within the grid bounds.</p>
<p>The other player has:
- A(7,1) - column 7, row 1
- M(3,3) - column 3, row 3  </p>
<ul>
<li>S(6,4) - column 6, row 4</li>
<li>P(4,6) - column 4, row 6</li>
<li>T(5,6) - column 5, row 6</li>
<li>O(6,6) - column 6, row 6</li>
<li>D(2,7) - column 2, row 7</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll track these precise locations carefully to understand the game's current state and potential moves.</p></p>

<p>I need to be more careful about spotting empty cells (◌) vs grid lines. Looking at row 4, I can see ◌ at positions (6,4) and (7,4). For row 5, there are ◌ symbols at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Let me try moving O to a safe spot first, maybe (2,5) since that's supposed to be P's target but I can move it there temporarily or find another spot.</p>
<p>Actually, let me look at what spots are truly empty: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) look empty. Row 4 has (6,4), (7,4) empty. Row 5 has (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) empty. Row 6 has (1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) empty. Row 7 has (1,7), (2,7), (3,7) empty.</p>
<p>Since we agreed on O(3,4) but that has a grid line, I should communicate this issue.</p></p>
