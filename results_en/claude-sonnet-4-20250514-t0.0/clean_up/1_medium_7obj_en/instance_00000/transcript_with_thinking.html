</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The upper edge displays x-coordinates increasing to the right, and the right edge y-coordinates increasing downward.</li>
<li>The following objects are randomly placed on your grid: 'P', 'O', 'T', 'S', 'D', 'A', 'M'.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other player sees a variation of the game board, where the objects are placed at different random locations. You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Both players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:</li>
<li><code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code>: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.</li>
<li><code>MOVE: &lt;OBJECT&gt;, (&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;)</code>: to move an object to a new position, where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the column and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.</li>
<li>If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 16 penalties, you both lose the game.</li>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>SAY: &lt;MESSAGE&gt;</code> command!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game</strong></p>
<p>If you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>SAY: finished?</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with <code>SAY: finished!</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p>Both players win if the game ends within 28 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<p>The closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p>Please send a message to the other player to start the game!</p></p>

        <p><p>I need to look at the grid more carefully. Looking at position (2,1), I see it contains '│' which is part of the grid structure, so I can't move there. Let me look for the first empty position in row 1. I see (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1) all contain grid elements. Let me check what's actually empty in row 1.</p>
<p>Looking at the grid:</p>
<pre><code> 1234567
╔═╤═╤═╤═╗
║A│◌│◌│◌║ 1
</code></pre>
<p>So (2,1) has │, (3,1) has ◌, (4,1) has ◌. Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me read this more carefully.</p>
<p>Actually looking at the format, it seems like the cells are between the grid lines. So position (2,1) would be between columns 1-2 in row 1, which contains │. </p>
<p>Let me look at what's actually available in row 1. I see A is at (1,1), and then there are ◌ symbols at what would be positions (3,1) and (4,1) based on the spacing. But I need to be more careful about the coordinate system.</p>
<p>Actually, let me look at this differently. The grid shows:
- A is at (1,1) 
- The next available spots in row 1 appear to be further right</p>
<p>I should move D to an available spot. Let me try (3,1).</p></p>
