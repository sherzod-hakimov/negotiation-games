B96 stands out as the most efficient item by far, with an impressive 10.92 ratio. A60 and B20 follow closely, offering significant value relative to their effort. These top-performing items will be my primary targets in negotiation, as they provide the most bang for the buck.\n\nI've calculated the cumulative effort so far, totaling 2,658 against a maximum of 2,984. This leaves me with just 326 effort remaining. Unfortunately, the next potential candidates like B33 and B21 exceed this remaining capacity, forcing me to be strategic about my final selections.\n\nThe current lineup includes high-impact items like B31 and C08, which contribute substantial importance while maintaining reasonable effort levels. I'll need to carefully weigh the remaining options to maximize overall efficiency within the remaining effort constraint.\n\nFortunately, C85 fits perfectly, requiring only 125 effort and adding 121 importance points. After incorporating C85, my total effort rises to 2,783, with just 201 effort left. No additional items can be included at this point.\n\nMy final set comprises 10 items, achieving a total importance of 5,518 while staying under the effort threshold. This selection represents an optimized approach to maximizing value within the given constraints."

Most of the high-importance items I have are included (B96: 783, C85: 822, B20: 668, A60: 583).\n\nHowever, let me see if I can do better. The items not included are:\n- A21: effort 350, importance 808 (very high importance!)\n- B33: effort 737, importance 121 (low importance)\n- B39: effort 389, importance 868 (very high importance!)\n- C81: effort 921, importance 780 (high importance)\n\n\n- B21: effort 789, importance 138 (low importance)\n\nI'm strategizing to incorporate A21 (808 importance) and B39 (868 importance), which are my highest-value unincluded items.\n\nCurrent effort budget used: 2783\nRemaining budget: 2984 - 2783 = 201\n\nA21 requires 350 effort and B39 requires 389 effort. I can't fit both.\n\nI'll focus on swapping out the lowest-value item to make room for A21. Removing A11, which has minimal importance (65) but consumes significant effort (616), could create the necessary space.\n\nIf I remove A11 and add A21, I'll gain substantial value. Removing A11 frees 616 effort while losing only 65 importance. Adding A21 brings 808 importance for 350 effort. This strategic trade yields a net positive of +743 importance and -266 effort.\n\nThe revised proposal would reduce total effort to 2517 and boost total importance to 5768 - a compelling optimization."

The total effort is 2300, well under the limit of 2984. And the total importance to me is 4014, which is quite high.\n\nLet me compare this to my previous proposal:\n{'B96', 'A60', 'B20', 'B09', 'B93', 'A82', 'A21', 'C85', 'B39'}\n- B96: 24 effort, 783 importance\n- A60: 117 effort, 583 importance  \n- B20: 143 effort, 668 importance\n- B09: 257 effort, 461 importance\n- B93: 276 effort, 484 importance\n- A82: 338 effort, 508 importance\n- A21: 350 effort, 808 importance\n- C85: 125 effort, 822 importance\n- B39: 389 effort, 868 importance\n\nTotal effort: 24 + 117 + 143 + 257 + 276 + 338 + 350 + 125 + 389 = 2019\n\n\nTotal importance: 783 + 583 + 668 + 461 + 484 + 508 + 808 + 822 + 868 = 5985\n\nI notice significant trade-offs in this new proposal. While the previous version scored 5985 in importance, the current one drops to 4014. The key changes involve removing three high-value items (A21, C85, and B39) and introducing B31, which has a much lower importance rating. Despite the lower overall score, the current proposal still maintains a reasonable balance between effort and importance.\n\nB21 represents a particularly unfavorable addition. With an effort of 789 and an importance of only 138, this item stands out as a poor strategic choice. The effort-to-importance ratio is extremely unbalanced, making it an unappealing component of the proposal.\n\nMy strategic response should involve crafting a counter-proposal that demonstrates flexibility while protecting my core interests. I'll aim to negotiate terms that more closely align with my original objectives, showing willingness to compromise without accepting clearly disadvantageous terms."
