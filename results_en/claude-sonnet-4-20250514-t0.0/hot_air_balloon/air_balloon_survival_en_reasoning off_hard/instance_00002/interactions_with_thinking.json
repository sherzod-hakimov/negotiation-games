I don't know the other player's importance values\n3. I need to use the structured formats and include ARGUMENT in every message\n\nLet me first calculate the effort and importance ratios for each item to see which are most valuable to me:\n\nItem effort/importance ratios (lower is better for me):\n- A21: 52/138 = 0.377\n- B93: 577/583 = 0.990  \n- A11: 177/868 = 0.204\n- B33: 702/822 = 0.854\n- C08: 119/783 = 0.152\n- B39: 232/65 = 3.569\n- B96: 577/262 = 2.202\n- C85: 205/121 = 1.694\n- A82: 516/508 = 1.016\n- B31: 582/780 = 0.746\n- B20: 676/461 = 1.466\n- A60: 906/484 = 1.872\n- B09: 316/668 = 0.473\n- C81: 433/389 = 1.113\n- B21: 336/808 = 0.416\n\nBest ratios (most valuable to me per effort):\n1. C08: 0.152 (effort 119, importance 783)\n2. A11: 0.204 (effort 177, importance 868) \n3. A21: 0.377 (effort 52, importance 138)\n4. B21: 0.416 (effort 336, importance 808)\n5. B09: 0.473 (effort 316, importance 668)\n\nLet me try to fit the best items within the limit:\nC08 + A11 + A21 + B21 + B09 = 119 + 177 + 52 + 336 + 316 = 1000\n\n\nTotal importance reaches 3265, and I'm still well under the effort limit. I'll strategically add more high-value items to maximize my total importance. The next best option is B31, which adds 582 effort and 780 importance, bringing my total to 1582 effort and 4045 importance. I can continue adding items like B33, which contributes 702 effort and 822 importance, further increasing my total to 2284 effort and 4867 importance.\n\nNow, B93 looks promising with its high efficiency. At 577 effort and 583 importance, it fits comfortably within my remaining capacity, pushing my total effort to 2861 and importance to 5450.",
