The most promising items stand out clearly: A11 leads with an exceptional 41.33 ratio, followed by A21 at 27.6. A82 also shows strong potential with a 5.84 ratio. These top-tier items suggest a strategic approach to maximizing importance while minimizing effort expenditure.\n\nThe comprehensive set I'm constructing includes these high-efficiency items, progressively adding components to optimize the total value. By carefully selecting items like A11, A21, A82, and C08, I'm building a framework that balances effort and importance. The cumulative effort reaches 2546, with a total importance of 4844, indicating a robust selection strategy.\n\nMy current analysis suggests there's room for further optimization, with approximately 3629 effort remaining to explore potential additional items or refine the existing set.\n\nI test adding B09, which fits within the remaining effort parameters. However, attempting to incorporate B21 would exceed the total effort limit. The refined set now includes nine items, with a total effort of 3244 and an impressive importance score of 5512.\n\nAfter this iteration, I have 385 effort remaining, presenting an opportunity for potential final adjustments to maximize overall value.\n\nI systematically evaluate additional candidates like B93, B39, and B96, finding they would push me over the limit. Fortunately, C85 emerges as a strategic addition - consuming 226 effort and contributing 121 importance points. This brings my total effort to 3470 and importance to 5633.\n\nWith just 159 effort left, no further items can be incorporated. My final optimized proposal comprises ten carefully selected items: A11, A21, A82, C08, B20, A60, B31, B33, B09, and C85.",

The other player seems to prefer B33, which suggests it might have higher importance to them.\n\nLet me calculate the total effort of their proposal:\nA11: 21, A21: 5, A82: 87, C08: 313, B20: 230, A60: 287, B31: 761, B33: 842, B09: 698, C85: 226\nTotal = 21+5+87+313+230+287+761+842+698+226 = 3470\n\nThis is well within the limit of 3629.\n\nLet me calculate my total importance from their proposal:\nA11: 65, A21: 808, A82: 508, C08: 262, B20: 668, A60: 583, B31: 389, B33: 121, B09: 461, C85: 822\nTotal = 65+808+508+262+668+583+389+121+461+822 = 4687\n\nAnd my proposal with B39 instead of B33:\nA11: 65, A21: 808, A82: 508, C08: 262, B20: 668, A60: 583, B31: 389, B39: 868, B09: 461, C85: 822\nTotal = 65+808+508+262+668+583+389+868+461+822 = 5434\n\nSo my proposal gives me 5434-4687 = 747 more importance points.\n\n\nI need a strategic alternative. B96 looks promising - it's a high-value item with 783 importance and 631 effort. I could potentially swap out some lower-value items to make this work.

I have 3629 - 2546 = 1083 effort remaining.\n\nLooking at items not included:\nB93: effort 793, importance 484\nB39: effort 842, importance 868\nB96: effort 631, importance 783\nC85: effort 226, importance 822\nB09: effort 698, importance 461\nC81: effort 641, importance 780\nB21: effort 882, importance 138\n\nI could add C85 (226 effort, 822 importance) which would bring total effort to 2772, still well under limit.\nOr I could add B96 (631 effort, 783 importance) bringing total to 3177.\nOr I could add C81 (641 effort, 780 importance) bringing total to 3187.\n\n\nOr I could add B09 (698 effort, 461 importance) bringing total to 3244.\nOr I could add B93 (793 effort, 484 importance) bringing total to 3339.\n\nI see potential for strategic combinations. By pairing C85 with B96, I'd gain 857 effort and 1605 total importance, keeping well under the 3629 limit. Another option is combining C85 and C81, which would total 867 effort.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I'm leaning towards the C85 + B96 combination. This provides the highest importance boost while maintaining efficient effort allocation. The additional 1605 importance could significantly enhance the overall value of my selection.",
