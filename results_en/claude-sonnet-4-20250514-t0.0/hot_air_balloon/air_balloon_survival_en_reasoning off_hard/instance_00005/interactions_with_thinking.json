I don't know the other player's importance values\n3. Let me calculate the efficiency (importance/effort) for each item to help guide my strategy:\n\nItem efficiencies (importance/effort):\n- A21: 138/147 = 0.939\n- B93: 583/698 = 0.835\n- A11: 65/588 = 0.111\n- B33: 262/43 = 6.093 (very high!)\n- C08: 121/356 = 0.340\n- B39: 508/80 = 6.350 (very high!)\n- B96: 461/95 = 4.853 (high)\n- C85: 484/743 = 0.651\n- A82: 668/106 = 6.302 (very high!)\n- B31: 389/308 = 1.263\n- B20: 215/325 = 0.662\n- A60: 97/255 = 0.380\n- B09: 500/276 = 1.812\n- C81: 30/543 = 0.055 (very low)\n- B21: 400/51 = 7.843 (highest!)\n\nThe most efficient items for me are:\n1. B21: 7.843 efficiency (400 importance, 51 effort)\n2. B39: 6.350 efficiency (508 importance, 80 effort)\n3. A82: 6.302 efficiency (668 importance, 106 effort)\n4. B33: 6.093 efficiency (262 importance, 43 effort)\n5. B96: 4.853 efficiency (461 importance, 95 effort)\n\nLet me start with a proposal that includes these high-efficiency items plus some others:\n\n\nI carefully select items to maximize my total importance while staying within the 2307 effort limit. My initial combination of high-efficiency items totals 1804 effort, leaving room for additional selections. I test adding more items strategically, checking each combination's total effort. Some potential additions push me over the limit, so I'll need to be selective about which items to include.\n\nMy current optimal set includes B21, B39, A82, B33, B96, B09, B31, A21, B93, and B20, which collectively require 2129 effort. These items represent a carefully curated group with a combined importance of 4124, suggesting a high-value selection strategy.\n\nI'm now considering whether alternative combinations might yield even better results, potentially optimizing my selection for maximum impact within the effort constraints.",

Removing B93, which has minimal importance but high effort, could create significant flexibility. This 698-effort slot could potentially accommodate more impactful alternatives that boost my overall proposal's value.\n\nBy swapping B93, I discover an opportunity to add C81, which provides a substantial 603 net importance gain while consuming only 543 of my available effort.
