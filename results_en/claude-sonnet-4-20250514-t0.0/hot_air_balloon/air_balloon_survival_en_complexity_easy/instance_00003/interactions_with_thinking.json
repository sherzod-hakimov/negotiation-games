I don't know the other participant's importance values\n5. I need to use the structured formats for communication\n\nLet me calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to identify the most valuable items for me:\n\nItem ratios (importance/effort):\n- B21: 138/830 = 0.166\n- B00: 583/638 = 0.914\n- A08: 868/607 = 1.430\n- A27: 822/106 = 7.755\n- B94: 783/630 = 1.243\n- B53: 65/382 = 0.170\n- A23: 262/773 = 0.339\n- C65: 121/455 = 0.266\n- A89: 508/262 = 1.939\n- B67: 780/634 = 1.230\n- B45: 461/60 = 7.683\n- C34: 484/54 = 8.963\n- C12: 668/849 = 0.787\n- A05: 389/801 = 0.486\n- B60: 808/324 = 2.494\n- C92: 215/164 = 1.311\n- B69: 97/832 = 0.117\n- A84: 500/136 = 3.676\n- C06: 30/980 = 0.031\n- B12: 915/946 = 0.967\n- A16: 856/645 = 1.327\n- B85: 400/842 = 0.475\n\n\n- C35: 444/106 = 4.189\n- B10: 623/116 = 5.371\n- C15: 781/875 = 0.893\n- B09: 786/446 = 1.762\n- B16: 3/649 = 0.005\n- C81: 713/601 = 1.186\n- A58: 457/252 = 1.815\n- C24: 273/763 = 0.358\n- A30: 739/213 = 3.469\n- A66: 822/517 = 1.590\n\nI'll focus on items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios.

I'll prioritize these when considering my selection strategy.\n\nBy combining the top items, I've allocated 816 effort points, leaving 7,954 effort remaining for additional selections. This suggests I have significant room to incorporate more high-value items into my overall approach.\n\nI'll strategically add the next set of high-ratio items, which increases my total effort allocation to 2,617. This brings my remaining effort capacity down to 6,153, indicating continued flexibility in item selection.\n\nThe next potential additions include items with lower but still compelling ratios, such as B46 and A08. These options provide opportunities to maximize importance while carefully managing effort expenditure. By methodically evaluating each item's ratio and potential contribution, I can optimize my overall strategy.\n\nIncorporating A16, C92, and B94 pushes my total effort to 5,070, leaving 3,700 in reserve. This systematic approach allows me to build a robust selection of high-value items while maintaining strategic flexibility.",
