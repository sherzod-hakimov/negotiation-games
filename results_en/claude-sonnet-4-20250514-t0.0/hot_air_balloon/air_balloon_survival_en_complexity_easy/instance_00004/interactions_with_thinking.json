The selection appears thoughtful, particularly including efficient items like B69 with minimal effort cost. However, I believe we can optimize this further given the remaining capacity of over 1,100 effort points. Some adjustments might help us both achieve better outcomes.'}\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B69', 'A30', 'A16', 'A27', 'B45', 'B60', 'A08', 'B67', 'B10', 'B09', 'A58', 'C70', 'A66', 'C15', 'C81', 'B12', 'A84', 'C12', 'B94', 'A05', 'C35'}",

Adding A05 and C35 more than compensates for losing B75, with a total importance gain of 598. This revised proposal looks favorable, so I'll move forward with accepting it.",
