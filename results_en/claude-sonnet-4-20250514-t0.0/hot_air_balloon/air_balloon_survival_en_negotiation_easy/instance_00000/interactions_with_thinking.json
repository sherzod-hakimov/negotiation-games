C42 stands out with an exceptional 6.91 ratio, followed by A67 at 3.75 and B42 at 2.85. These items provide the most value relative to their effort requirements. I'll prioritize these high-performing items in my negotiation strategy to maximize overall importance while staying within the 3358 effort limit.\n\nAfter selecting the initial high-ratio items, I've calculated the cumulative effort at 1772, with a total importance of 4410. I still have 1586 effort remaining, which allows me to consider additional items. A18, C67, and C73 all fit within the remaining budget, each offering a reasonable importance-to-effort trade-off. I'll carefully evaluate each to optimize my final selection.\n\nThe final set includes 10 items, balancing effort and importance strategically. By meticulously tracking available resources and selecting items that maximize value, I've constructed a proposal with 3188 total effort and 5927 total importance. This approach ensures I'm making the most efficient use of the available resources while maintaining a high-impact selection."

They removed C73 (508 importance to me) and C08 (138 importance to me) from their original proposal, net losing me 646-138 = 508 importance points.\n\nI could try to negotiate for something better. With effort of 2498, we have 3358-2498 = 860 effort remaining. I could try to add back C73 (519 effort, 508 importance) or C10 (862 effort, 780 importance). C10 would barely fit and gives me more importance.\n\nActually, let me double-check the opponent's refusal - they said my proposal exceeded the limit. Let me recalculate: C42 (117) + A67 (219) + B42 (275) + C61 (347) + B36 (262) + A43 (552) + A18 (377) + C73 (519) + C10 (862) + C55 (933) = 4463.
