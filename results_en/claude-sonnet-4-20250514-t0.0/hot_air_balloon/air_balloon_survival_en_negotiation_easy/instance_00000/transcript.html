I should start by proposing a set that includes these high-efficiency items while staying under the 3358 limit. My optimal set appears to be {C42, A67, B42, C61, B36, A43, A18, C67, C73, C08} with total effort of 3188 and total importance to me of 5927.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent has proposed a set with total effort of 3188, well within our limit. Looking at my importance values, this gives me a total importance of 5929, which is quite strong. The proposal includes many of my highest-value items like C42 (808), A67 (822), B42 (783), and A43 (868). However, I notice they included some lower-value items for me like C08 (138) and C67 (389). I could potentially negotiate for a better mix by removing these and adding C10 (780) or C55 (583) if effort allows. Let me see if I can push for improvements while not being too greedy.&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your proposal has merit and shows good efficiency thinking. However, I notice some items in your selection might not be optimal for both our interests. For instance, including C08 uses effort that could potentially be allocated to higher-impact items like C10, which might provide better overall value.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;A67&#x27;, &#x27;B42&#x27;, &#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;, &#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;A18&#x27;, &#x27;C73&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;C55&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent correctly refused my proposal as it exceeded the limit - I made an error in calculation. Their new proposal has effort of 2498, giving me importance of 5283. This is decent but lower than their original proposal which gave me 5929.
