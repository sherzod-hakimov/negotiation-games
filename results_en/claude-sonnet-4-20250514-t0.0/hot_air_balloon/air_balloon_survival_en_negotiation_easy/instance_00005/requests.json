C61: 5.613 (effort=119, importance=668)\n2. C55: 4.94 (effort=118, importance=583)\n3. C42: 4.698 (effort=172, importance=808)\n4. A18: 2.916 (effort=166, importance=484)\n5. A62: 1.585 (effort=41, importance=65)\n6. B19: 1.358 (effort=193, importance=262)\n7. C10: 1.298 (effort=601, importance=780)\n\n\n8. B36: 1.067 (effort=432, importance=461)\n9. A43: 1.026 (effort=846, importance=868)\n10. B42: 0.968 (effort=809, importance=783)\n\nI'm strategically selecting items to maximize total importance while staying within the effort limit. Starting with the highest efficiency items, I've selected a combination that totals 1842 in effort. This leaves room to add more items, so I'll continue building my optimal set by incorporating additional high-value options.\n\nAfter adding A43, I'm at 2688 effort, which is still under the 3170 limit. However, adding B42 pushes me over the threshold. My current set includes C61, C55, C42, A18, A62, B19, C10, B36, and A43, with a total effort of 2688 and an importance score of 4979.\n\nI'm now exploring potential item swaps to optimize the set. With 482 effort remaining, I'm considering replacing A62 with C43, though this would require careful calculation of the efficiency trade-off.\n\nAfter analyzing multiple potential replacements, I discover a promising swap: removing A62 and adding C67. This modification increases my total effort to 3109 (still under the limit) and boosts my importance score by 324, from 4979 to 5303. The new set now includes C61, C55, C42, A18, B19, C10, B36, A43, and C67, representing a more strategic selection.",

          "thinking": "Let me analyze the opponent's proposal first.\n\nProposed items: {'C61', 'C55', 'C42', 'A18', 'B19', 'C10', 'B36', 'A43', 'C67'}\n\nLet me calculate the total effort for this proposal:\n- C61: 119\n- C55: 118 \n- C42: 172\n- A18: 166\n- B19: 193\n- C10: 601\n- B36: 432\n- A43: 846\n- C67: 462\n\nTotal effort = 119 + 118 + 172 + 166 + 193 + 601 + 432 + 846 + 462 = 3109\n\nThis is within the limit of 3170, so it's valid.\n\nNow let me calculate my total importance for this set:\n- C61: 668\n- C55: 583\n- C42: 808\n- A18: 484\n- B19: 262\n- C10: 780\n- B36: 461\n- A43: 868\n- C67: 389\n\nTotal importance for me = 668 + 583 + 808 + 484 + 262 + 780 + 461 + 868 + 389 = 5303\n\nThis seems like a decent proposal, but let me see if I can do better. Let me look at my importance/effort ratios to identify the most efficient items:\n\nC08: 138/424 = 0.326\nC55: 583/118 = 4.94\nA43: 868/846 = 1.026\nA67: 822/907 = 0.906\nB42: 783/809 = 0.968\nA62: 65/41 = 1.585\nB19: 262/193 = 1.358\n\n\nC43: 121/246 = 0.492\nC73: 508/805 = 0.631\nC10: 780/601 = 1.298\nB36: 461/432 = 1.067\nA18: 484/166 = 2.916\nC61: 668/119 = 5.613\nC67: 389/462 = 0.842\nC42: 808/172 = 4.698\n\nI've identified the top-performing items based on their importance-to-effort ratios. The standout performers are C61, C55, and C42, which offer the most value relative to their resource investment. These items demonstrate exceptional efficiency, with ratios significantly higher than the other candidates.\n\nNow, I'm exploring potential optimization strategies. By swapping C67 with A62, I can potentially improve the overall selection. A62 offers a more attractive ratio of 1.585 with minimal effort of 41, compared to C67's less favorable 0.842 and higher effort of 462. This strategic replacement would result in a net reduction of 324 in importance and 421 in effort, suggesting a more streamlined and efficient approach.\n\nI then consider simply adding A62 without removing any existing items. With my current effort at 3109 and A62 requiring only 41, the new total of 3150 remains comfortably under the 3170 limit. This addition would contribute 65 importance for a modest 41 effort, representing an efficient enhancement to my selection.\n\nMy refined counter-proposal includes ten items: {'C61', 'C55', 'C42', 'A18', 'B19', 'C10', 'B36', 'A43', 'C67', 'A62'}. A quick verification confirms the total effort at 3150, precisely matching the constraint.\n\nThe resulting importance jumps to 5368, a meaningful improvement over my initial proposal of 5303.",

Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3170\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C08\": 424, \"C55\": 118, \"A43\": 846, \"A67\": 907, \"B42\": 809, \"A62\": 41, \"B19\": 193, \"C43\": 246, \"C73\": 805, \"C10\": 601, \"B36\": 432, \"A18\": 166, \"C61\": 119, \"C67\": 462, \"C42\": 172}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C08\": 138, \"C55\": 583, \"A43\": 868, \"A67\": 822, \"B42\": 783, \"A62\": 65, \"B19\": 262, \"C43\": 121, \"C73\": 508, \"C10\": 780, \"B36\": 461, \"A18\": 484, \"C61\": 668, \"C67\": 389, \"C42\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace.

          "thinking": "The other player has made a new proposal that takes my proposal and adds A62 to it. Let me check the effort calculation:\n\nMy original proposal effort: C61(119) + C55(118) + C42(172) + A18(166) + B19(193) + C10(601) + B36(432) + A43(846) + C67(462) = 3109\n\nAdding A62(41): 3109 + 41 = 3150, which is still under 3170 limit.\n\nFrom my perspective, A62 has importance 65 and effort 41, giving an efficiency ratio of 1.59, which is quite low compared to my other selected items. However, the other player seems to value A62 enough to add it, and it doesn't hurt me much since the effort cost is low and we're still under budget.\n\nThis could be a reasonable compromise. The other player is showing flexibility by building on my proposal rather than completely changing it, which suggests they might value many of the same items I do. I should consider whether to accept this or negotiate further.\n\nSince A62 has low importance to me but low effort cost, and the other player seems to want it, this might be a good deal overall. I could accept this or try to negotiate for something better.",
