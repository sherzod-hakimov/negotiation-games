However, adding B42 pushes me over the threshold. My current set includes C61, C55, C42, A18, A62, B19, C10, B36, and A43, with a total effort of 2688 and an importance score of 4979.\n\nI'm now exploring potential item swaps to optimize the set. With 482 effort remaining, I'm considering replacing A62 with C43, though this would require careful calculation of the efficiency trade-off.\n\nAfter analyzing multiple potential replacements, I discover a promising swap: removing A62 and adding C67. This modification increases my total effort to 3109 (still under the limit) and boosts my importance score by 324, from 4979 to 5303. The new set now includes C61, C55, C42, A18, B19, C10, B36, A43, and C67, representing a more strategic selection.",

The standout performers are C61, C55, and C42, which offer the most value relative to their resource investment. These items demonstrate exceptional efficiency, with ratios significantly higher than the other candidates.\n\nNow, I'm exploring potential optimization strategies. By swapping C67 with A62, I can potentially improve the overall selection. A62 offers a more attractive ratio of 1.585 with minimal effort of 41, compared to C67's less favorable 0.842 and higher effort of 462. This strategic replacement would result in a net reduction of 324 in importance and 421 in effort, suggesting a more streamlined and efficient approach.\n\nI then consider simply adding A62 without removing any existing items. With my current effort at 3109 and A62 requiring only 41, the new total of 3150 remains comfortably under the 3170 limit. This addition would contribute 65 importance for a modest 41 effort, representing an efficient enhancement to my selection.\n\nMy refined counter-proposal includes ten items: {'C61', 'C55', 'C42', 'A18', 'B19', 'C10', 'B36', 'A43', 'C67', 'A62'}. A quick verification confirms the total effort at 3150, precisely matching the constraint.\n\nThe resulting importance jumps to 5368, a meaningful improvement over my initial proposal of 5303.",
