The top performers stand out clearly: C55 leads with an exceptional 14.22 ratio, followed by A67 at 10.96, and C10 at 6.05. These items offer the most value for their effort, making them prime candidates for selection within my effort limit.\n\nI've assembled an initial set of high-performing items, consuming 1170 effort points and accumulating 4320 importance. With 2118 effort remaining, I'll strategically evaluate the next potential additions to optimize my overall impact.\n\nBy incorporating B36, C61, and C42, I can expand the set while staying under the total effort limit. These three items require 1781 effort, bringing the total effort to 2951 - comfortably within the 3288 constraint. The importance jumps from 4320 to 6257, representing a significant value enhancement.\n\nThe final proposed optimal set includes nine items: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, B36, C61, and C42. This combination maximizes importance while carefully managing the effort budget.",

I need to look at efficiency (importance/effort ratio) for each item:\n\nC08: 138/329 = 0.42\nC55: 583/41 = 14.22\nA43: 868/417 = 2.08\nA67: 822/75 = 10.96\nB42: 783/390 = 2.01\nA62: 65/887 = 0.07\nB19: 262/808 = 0.32\nC43: 121/151 = 0.80\n\n\nC73: 508/849 = 0.60\nC10: 780/129 = 6.05\nB36: 461/350 = 1.32\nA18: 484/118 = 4.10\nC61: 668/630 = 1.06\nC67: 389/602 = 0.65\nC42: 808/801 = 1.01\n\nI'll prioritize items with the highest efficiency ratios. The top performers are C55 and A67, offering exceptional value relative to their effort. C10 and A18 also show promising efficiency, making them strong candidates for optimization.\n\nBy selecting top-tier items like C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, and B42, I calculate a total effort of 1170. This combination suggests a strategic approach to maximizing impact while minimizing resource expenditure. The potential importance seems substantial, with initial calculations pointing to significant value.\n\nIncrementally adding B36, C61, and C42 progressively increases both effort and importance. Interestingly, this progression mirrors the opponent's proposal exactly, indicating they've made a remarkably efficient selection from my perspective.\n\nWith minimal effort remaining - just 337 units - I'm exploring potential additions like C08, which could potentially optimize the overall strategy without exceeding resource constraints.\n\nSeveral replacement scenarios emerge: combining C08 and C43 offers a modest 259 importance for 480 effort, while mixing C67 and C43 provides a more substantial 510 importance for 753 effort. I'm carefully weighing these trade-offs to maximize strategic value within the remaining resource limit.\n\nUpon deeper analysis, the opponent's proposed solution appears highly advantageous. Their strategy seems compelling enough that accepting their proposal would likely be my most prudent course of action.",

            "text": "You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.\n\nTogether with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3288\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C08\": 329, \"C55\": 41, \"A43\": 417, \"A67\": 75, \"B42\": 390, \"A62\": 887, \"B19\": 808, \"C43\": 151, \"C73\": 849, \"C10\": 129, \"B36\": 350, \"A18\": 118, \"C61\": 630, \"C67\": 602, \"C42\": 801}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C08\": 138, \"C55\": 583, \"A43\": 868, \"A67\": 822, \"B42\": 783, \"A62\": 65, \"B19\": 262, \"C43\": 121, \"C73\": 508, \"C10\": 780, \"B36\": 461, \"A18\": 484, \"C61\": 668, \"C67\": 389, \"C42\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."
