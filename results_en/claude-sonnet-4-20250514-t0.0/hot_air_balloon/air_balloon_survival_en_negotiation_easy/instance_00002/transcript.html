Let me compare: B36 gives me 461 importance for 350 effort (ratio 1.32) while C08 gives me only 138 importance for 329 effort (ratio 0.42). This swap costs me 323 importance points while only saving 21 effort points. Their proposal gives me total importance of 5934 vs my original 6257.

Comparing these: B36 gives me 461 importance for 350 effort (1.31 per effort) while C08 gives me only 138 importance for 329 effort (0.42 per effort). They are actually helping me by preferring B36! Their original proposal gave me 6257 total importance. With 337 effort remaining from their original proposal, I could try to add a small high-value item, but most remaining items are either too expensive or low-value for me.
