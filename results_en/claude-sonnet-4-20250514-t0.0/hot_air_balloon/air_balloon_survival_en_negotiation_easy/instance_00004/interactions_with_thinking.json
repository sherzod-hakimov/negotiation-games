This brings the total importance to 6283, demonstrating a methodical approach to maximizing value.\n\nWith just 196 effort remaining, I systematically assess potential additions, quickly eliminating options that exceed my remaining budget. A62 emerges as the optimal final selection, fitting precisely within my constraints and bringing the total effort to 3060.\n\nAfter adding A62's 65 importance, my set reaches 6348 total importance.
