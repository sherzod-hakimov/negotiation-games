After incorporating several key items, I now have 2825 total effort expended.\n\nWith 887 effort remaining, I'm exploring potential candidates to complete the set. B36 and C67 look promising, each offering a different balance of effort and importance. I'm calculating potential total effort and remaining capacity to ensure I maximize the selection's overall value.\n\nExamining A62 reveals an interesting option: 230 effort with 65 importance. This would bring my total effort to 3429 and importance to 5959. The relatively low importance suggests I'll need to be strategic about this potential inclusion.\n\nI notice some candidates like C73 and A18 exceed my remaining effort budget of 513, so they're automatically ruled out. I'm methodically screening each option against my current constraints.\n\nAfter careful verification, I confirm the calculation: adding A62 alongside my existing selections creates a balanced portfolio. With 283 effort remaining, I've maximized my current strategy without overextending."
