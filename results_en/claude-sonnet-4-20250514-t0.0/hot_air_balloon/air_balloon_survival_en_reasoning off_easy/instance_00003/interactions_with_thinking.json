The bottom-tier items have extremely low importance-to-effort ratios, with C47 being particularly inefficient at just 0.08. These items would likely consume significant resources for minimal benefit.\n\nI'll strategically select the next best option to maximize the remaining 428 effort budget. Looking at the sequence, B91 stands out as an excellent candidate with its high importance of 583 and minimal effort of 45. This could provide a strategic boost to the overall proposal without overextending resources.\n\nThe current selection spans 2779 effort with 5641 total importance, leaving precisely 428 effort available. However, the remaining options like B11, C75, B26, C26, and C47 exceed this remaining budget, making them unfeasible additions.\n\nThe proposed combination appears carefully balanced, leveraging items with strong importance-to-effort ratios while staying within strict resource constraints."

With 428 remaining capacity and B11 requiring 835 effort, I'll need to remove items totaling at least 407 in effort to make this work.\n\nI examine A47 as a potential removal, which would allow B11's inclusion. However, this swap results in a minimal 3-point importance loss while consuming 407 more effort. The trade-off seems unfavorable. After careful consideration, the current proposal appears optimal, so I'll proceed with accepting it as is."
