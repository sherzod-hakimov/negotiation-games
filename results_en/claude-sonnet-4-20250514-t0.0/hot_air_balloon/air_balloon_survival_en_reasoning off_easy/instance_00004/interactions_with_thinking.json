B11 and B26 stand out as incredibly efficient choices, offering massive importance relative to their minimal effort. A56, C26, and A30 also look promising with ratios above 1.5. I'll start by selecting these top performers to maximize my overall importance within the effort constraint.\n\nCurrently, I've committed 1956 effort across seven items, totaling 4672 importance. I still have 1433 effort remaining to optimize. The next potential candidates, B91 and A15, have slightly lower ratios around 1.1, but could still contribute meaningfully to the overall strategy. I'm considering adding B91 and A15 to see how they fit into the remaining effort budget.\n\nBy incorporating these two items, my total effort reaches 3234, which is comfortably within the 3389 limit. The importance jumps to 6035, a significant increase. With just 155 effort left, I spot one more potential addition: C75, a small item that could marginally improve the set's overall value.\n\nAdding C75 would bring the total effort to 3359, still under the constraint, and boost importance to 6100. This suggests my current selection strategy is yielding an increasingly optimized set of items.\n\nThe final proposed collection includes a diverse mix of items from different categories, carefully balanced to maximize importance while respecting the effort limitation."
