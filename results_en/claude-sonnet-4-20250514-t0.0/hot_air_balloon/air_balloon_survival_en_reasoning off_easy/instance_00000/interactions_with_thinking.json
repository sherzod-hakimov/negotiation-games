C47 stands out as the most efficient, offering 783 importance for just 211 effort. B91 follows closely, providing 583 importance at 252 effort. A30 and B26 also look promising, delivering high importance relative to their effort requirements.\n\nAfter selecting these top items, I've accumulated 2,042 effort and 3,864 importance. This leaves 2,337 effort capacity remaining. A75 seems like a potential next candidate, requiring 401 effort and contributing 461 importance. I'll continue evaluating the remaining items to maximize the overall value within the effort constraints.\n\nBy adding A47, I've increased the total effort to 2,965 and reduced remaining capacity to 1,414. A15 looks promising but consumes 803 effort, bringing the total to 3,768 with just 611 effort left. Some items like C24 and A56 exceed the remaining capacity.\n\nI ultimately propose the set {C47, B91, A30, B26, B11, A75, A47, A15, C73}, which strategically balances effort and importance while staying within the 4,379 effort limit.\n\nVerifying the proposal, I calculate the total effort at 4,115, which fits perfectly. The importance score reaches an impressive 5,734, suggesting a robust selection strategy that maximizes value within tight constraints.",

The current proposal has high-value items like C47 with a 3.71 ratio, while the missing items have lower ratios. C24 stands out with a 0.65 ratio, which is more promising than some of the other missing items. This suggests I might want to consider swapping some lower-performing items in the current proposal.\n\nI've identified C73 as the weakest item with a 0.35 ratio. By replacing it with C24, I can improve the overall proposal's metrics. Calculating the new effort and importance shows a potential gain: the effort increases to 4367, which is within the acceptable limit, and the importance rises to 6002. This strategic substitution could enhance the proposal's effectiveness.",
