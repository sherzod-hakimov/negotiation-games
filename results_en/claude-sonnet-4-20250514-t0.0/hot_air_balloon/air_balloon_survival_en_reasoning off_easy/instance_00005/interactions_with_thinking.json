C24 stands out with an exceptional ratio of 4.802, followed by B91 at 2.031 and A15 at 2.000. These top-performing items will form the core of my selection strategy, maximizing importance while minimizing effort.\n\nI'll start building my set with these high-efficiency items, carefully tracking the total effort to ensure I stay within the 4915 limit.\n\nAfter adding A15, A30, and B11, my total effort reaches 1716, with an impressive importance score of 3442. I still have 3199 effort points remaining, which gives me flexibility to incorporate additional items.\n\nExamining the next best options - B26, C47, and A56 - I strategically add them to optimize my selection. By including B26, C47, and A56 in sequence, I incrementally build a set that maximizes efficiency while staying within the budget constraints.\n\nThe final combination looks promising, with a carefully curated mix of high-ratio items that balance effort and importance.\n\nI notice a small remaining budget of 371 effort points, which presents an intriguing optimization challenge. While C75 technically fits, its low importance suggests it might not be the most strategic choice.",

But let me see if I can do better. I have a remaining capacity of 4915 - 3596 = 1319.\n\nLooking at my importance values, what items are not included that I value highly?\nNot included: A19 (138), A30 (868) - wait A30 is included\nLet me list what's NOT included: A19, C75, C26, C73, A47, A75, A39, A56\n\nNot included with my importance:\n- A19: 138\n- C75: 65\n- C26: 262\n\n\n- C73: 121\n- A47: 508\n- A75: 461\n- A39: 484\n- A56: 668\n\nI see potential to optimize my selection. With 1319 remaining capacity, I can strategically add several high-value items. A56, A75, A39, and A47 all fit within my constraints and offer significant importance. I'll carefully evaluate each to maximize my overall value while staying under the effort limit.\n\nCalculating the importance-to-effort ratios reveals A56 as the most promising candidate, delivering 0.70 units of importance per effort point. This makes A56 my top priority for inclusion, consuming 948 of my available 1319 capacity.\n\nAfter adding A56, I'm left with 371 remaining capacity. Reviewing potential additions, most options exceed my remaining space. C75 emerges as the only feasible addition, but its modest 65 importance suggests it's not compelling enough.\n\nI'm now pivoting to a more strategic approach. Rather than simply filling remaining space, I'll reassess the entire proposal. The opponent's current offer provides substantial value at 5033 importance, prompting me to consider a nuanced counter-strategy that could potentially improve my position.\n\nMy goal is to craft a counter-proposal that maximizes my potential benefit, carefully balancing available capacity and strategic value.",
