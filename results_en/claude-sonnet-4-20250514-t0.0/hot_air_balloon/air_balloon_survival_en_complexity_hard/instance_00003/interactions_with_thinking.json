But still, it does exceed the limit of 6938 by 124 points.\n\n\nI'll analyze their importance proposal carefully. Their selection yields 8679 importance points, which is substantial. With 249 effort points still available, I can strategically add small items to optimize my selection. I'm looking at potential additions like B23 and A88, which have low effort but meaningful importance. I'll continue evaluating the remaining options to maximize my overall impact within the remaining effort budget.\n\nBy combining B23, A88, A46, A96, and A97, I can invest 122 effort points to gain 617 additional importance. This would bring my total effort to 6811, leaving 127 effort points unused. Alternatively, I could incorporate B37, which would increase my effort to 6868 and reduce my remaining effort to 70 points, while adding 156 importance.\n\nI see another potential strategy involving C82 or C84, which would slightly adjust my total effort and importance. These options offer nuanced trade-offs in resource allocation."
