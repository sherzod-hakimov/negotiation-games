Let me revise my response to include a proper argument while refusing their proposal and making a counter-proposal that stays within the limit.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the total effort of their proposal to confirm it's over the limit:\nA87 (28) + A75 (76) + A08 (132) + C53 (188) + B69 (239) + A65 (302) + C17 (301) + C51 (310) + C82 (349) + B96 (375) + B19 (388) + C72 (431) + B34 (420) + A25 (517) + A46 (540) + A71 (588) + B15 (660) + A28 (623) + C79 (718) + B16 (707) + A39 (708) + B95 (800) + A88 (831) + C10 (785) + A97 (775) + C83 (774) + C84 (768) + A96 (888) + C60 (879) + B81 (983) + B64 (986) + A94 (950) + B43 (997) = 19,623\n\nYes, way over the limit.\n\nNow I need to make a feasible counter-proposal. Let me select high-importance items that fit within 10,073:\n\nTop importance items:\nB43: 1096 importance, 997 effort\nB64: 1085 importance, 986 effort  \nB81: 1082 importance, 983 effort\nA94: 1049 importance, 950 effort\nA96: 987 importance, 888 effort\nC60: 978 importance, 879 effort\nA88: 930 importance, 831 effort\nB95: 899 importance, 800 effort\nC10: 884 importance, 785 effort\n\n\nA97: 874 importance, 775 effort\nC83: 873 importance, 774 effort\nC84: 867 importance, 768 effort\n\nI'll strategically combine these top items to maximize importance while staying under the effort limit. By carefully selecting B43, B64, B81, and A94, I create a compact package totaling 3,916 effort. Then I'll incrementally add A96, C60, and A88 to optimize the selection, leaving just enough room for final adjustments.\n\nAfter precise calculations, I've identified a comprehensive set of items including B43, B64, B81, A94, C60, A96, A88, B95, C10, A97, C83, A65, A87, and A75. This combination achieves a total effort of 10,054, strategically balancing importance and resource constraints."
