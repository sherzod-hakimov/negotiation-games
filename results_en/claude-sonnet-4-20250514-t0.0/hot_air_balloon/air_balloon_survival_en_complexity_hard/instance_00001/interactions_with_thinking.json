The three low-importance items (C17, A75, A28) are offset by the inclusion of high-value items. Since we still have 266 effort units left, I could try to add one more item, but looking at my remaining high-importance items that aren't included:\n\nC72: 818 importance, 722 effort - too much effort\nA94: 800 importance, 704 effort - too much effort  \nA96: 788 importance, 692 effort - too much effort\nC10: 733 importance, 637 effort - too much effort\n\n\nActually, let me check some smaller items:\nB95: 300 importance, 204 effort - fits\nA88: 271 importance, 175 effort - fits\nC60: 246 importance, 150 effort - fits\n\nI see some promising smaller items that could potentially fill the remaining effort space. The B95, A88, and C60 options all require less effort and could complement the existing proposal. Each fits within the 266 unused effort units, presenting an opportunity to enhance the overall value without overextending resources.",

This includes most of my highest importance items: A08 (1059), A65 (1057), B96 (997), A71 (858), A25 (834), B23 (833), C79 (827), B19 (826), C82 (729), A87 (741). The three low-importance items (C17, A75, A28) add only 366 total importance but use minimal effort. Total importance to me would be 10227, which is excellent. I could try to squeeze in one more item with the remaining 266 effort, but this is already a very strong proposal for me.'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'This is a well-balanced proposal that efficiently uses our effort budget while including high-value items. The addition of C82 and A87 makes good use of our remaining capacity, and the combination provides strong overall value within our constraint.'}\n\nAGREE: {'A08', 'A65', 'B96', 'A71', 'A25', 'B23', 'C79', 'B19', 'C17', 'A75', 'A28', 'C82', 'A87'}",
