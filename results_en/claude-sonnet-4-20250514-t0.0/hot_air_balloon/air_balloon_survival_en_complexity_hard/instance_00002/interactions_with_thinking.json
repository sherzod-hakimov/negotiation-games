I could try to squeeze in one more item with the remaining 489 effort, but looking at what's left, the best options might be:\n- B69 (326 effort, 422 importance)\n\n\n- A25 (283 effort, 379 importance) \n- A65 (351 effort, 447 importance)\n- C53 (300 effort, 396 importance)\n- B96 (319 effort, 415 importance)\n- C84 (440 effort, 536 importance)\n\nI'll analyze the potential additions carefully. C84 stands out with the highest importance of 536, but it requires 440 effort. A65 looks more efficient, offering 447 importance for just 351 effort. I'll test adding A65 to see if it improves my overall proposal.",
