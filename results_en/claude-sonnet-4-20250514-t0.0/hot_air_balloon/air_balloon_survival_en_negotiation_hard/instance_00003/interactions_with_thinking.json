A04 and A03 also look promising, offering significant importance with relatively modest effort requirements. I'll need to carefully select items that balance high value against the strict effort constraint, potentially creating a strategic combination that optimizes my overall gain.\n\nMy initial selection includes top performers like A77, A04, C17, A03, B33, A87, and B32. These items collectively represent an impressive importance score of 5312, achieved through an effort investment of 3321. I notice I still have 360 effort remaining, which suggests I might be able to incorporate additional items strategically.\n\nSpecifically, I'm considering whether C54 could fit into my remaining effort budget, as its 508 importance seems compelling against its 209 effort requirement.\n\nAfter adding C54, my total effort rises to 3530, with an importance boost to 5820. I then realize C00, with its modest 116 effort and 121 importance, could potentially complete my selection without exceeding constraints.\n\nMy final optimized set becomes {'A77', 'A04', 'C17', 'A03', 'B33', 'A87', 'B32', 'C54', 'C00'}, precisely balancing 3646 effort against my 3681 limit while maximizing overall importance.\n\nThe cumulative importance reaches 5941, confirming an efficient allocation strategy."
