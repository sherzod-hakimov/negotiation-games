The standout performers are A87, A03, and C00, which provide exceptional value with minimal effort. These items offer the highest return on investment, with A87 being particularly remarkable at 32.93 points per effort unit. I'll focus on selecting these high-efficiency items first to maximize my overall importance within the total effort limit.\n\nBy strategically adding A87, A03, C00, B86, and B41, I've accumulated 745 effort points and 2796 importance points. This leaves me with 2879 effort remaining. I'll continue building the set by carefully selecting additional items like A10, A71, and C01, which progressively increase both effort and importance. My goal is to optimize the set's total value while staying within the effort constraints.\n\nThe current strategy involves methodically adding items that provide the most significant impact relative to their resource requirements. With 591 effort points still available, I'm exploring potential candidates like A04 to complete the set efficiently.\n\nAfter incorporating A04 and C17, the proposed set looks promising. It balances effort and importance effectively, utilizing 3364 effort points to achieve 5511 total importance across ten carefully selected items."

B33 and B32 are particularly interesting, with high importance scores of 780 and 583 respectively. However, their efforts are substantial - 989 and 559. I'll need to carefully calculate if I can incorporate these without exceeding the total effort limit.\n\nThe current proposal includes some low-value, high-effort items like A71 and A10, which don't align with my priorities.

However, A71 requires 831 effort units which significantly constrains our ability to include other beneficial items. By substituting A77 for A71, we reduce effort from 2673 to only 2669 - practically the same - while potentially achieving better overall returns. A77 offers superior efficiency and this small change maintains the collaborative spirit of our negotiation while optimizing our resource utilization within the 3624 limit.'}",

It's much better than their earlier proposals. They replaced A71 (868 importance to me) with A77 (65 importance to me), so I'm losing 803 importance points there. But this proposal still gives me 3900 importance which is decent.\n\nLet me check the effort: A87 (14) + A03 (25) + C00 (111) + B86 (304) + B41 (291) + C01 (766) + A04 (121) + C17 (210) + A77 (827) = 2669, which is within the limit.\n\nI could try one more time to get A71 instead of A77, but they've rejected that multiple times. The difference in importance to me is significant (868 vs 65), but they seem very resistant to A71. \n\nI think I should accept this proposal since it gives me a decent total importance and includes most of my high-efficiency items. Continuing to negotiate might lead to them removing other valuable items."
