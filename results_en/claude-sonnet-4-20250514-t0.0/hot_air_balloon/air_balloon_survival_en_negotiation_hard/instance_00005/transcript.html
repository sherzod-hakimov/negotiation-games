        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal is still terrible for me - only 1166 total importance versus the 3819 I could get with my optimal set. They really seem to want B33, A71, B32, C17 which are all low-value to me. I can use this to my advantage by giving them some of these items they clearly prioritize while keeping my most valuable ones.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their latest proposal gives me 2098 importance (A87:461, A04:138, C54:30, B86:121, A77:97, B33:668, A71:583). This is much better since they included my top two items B33 and A71! The effort is only 2429, leaving lots of room. I could try to get even more by swapping out their low-value items like C54:30, A04:138, A77:97 for my high-value B32:508 and C17:484.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal gives me only 1307 importance, still far below my optimal. However, they kept A87 and B86 which I value highly. With 2641 effort used, we have 745 effort remaining.
