A03: 215 (effort: 544)\n10. \n\nI'll continue evaluating potential items to optimize my selection. The next set of items includes A04 with 138 importance and 138 effort, B86 with 121 importance and 399 effort, and A77 with 97 importance and 685 effort. I'm strategizing to maximize importance while staying within the effort limit. \n\nI'm currently focusing on my top-ranked items: B33, A71, B32, and C17. These items offer the highest importance values with varying effort requirements. My goal is to construct a combination that provides maximum value while keeping the total effort under the 3386 limit.\n\nBy adding A10 with 262 importance and 437 effort, I can increase my total importance to 3755, which is significantly better than my previous result of 1389. This strategic selection leaves me with 168 effort remaining, providing flexibility for potential future adjustments. The A04 item doesn't fit well with A10, so I'll exclude it from my current optimization strategy.\n\nI've carefully verified my proposed combination: B33, A71, B32, C17, A87, C00, C01, and A10. The total effort of 3218 is within my 3386 limit, confirming the feasibility of this approach. Given the clear advantages of my proposed selection, I'll confidently reject their original proposal and develop my own strategic solution.",

          "thinking": "The opponent has refused my proposal and made a new one. Let me calculate what their new proposal gives me in importance:\nA87: 461\nA04: 138  \nC54: 30\nB86: 121\nC01: 389\nC00: 400\nA10: 262\n\nTotal importance to me: 461 + 138 + 30 + 121 + 389 + 400 + 262 = 1801\n\nLet me check the effort for their proposal:\nA87: 4\nA04: 203\nC54: 369\nB86: 399\nC01: 539\nC00: 461\nA10: 437\n\nTotal effort: 4 + 203 + 369 + 399 + 539 + 461 + 437 = 2412\n\nThis is indeed under the limit of 3386, so it's valid. But I can still do much better. Their proposal gives me 1801 importance, but I know I can get much more.\n\nLet me try to find a better combination. My highest value items are:\nB33: 668 (effort 594)\nA71: 583 (effort 175)\nB32: 508 (effort 695)\nC17: 484 (effort 313)\nA87: 461 (effort 4)\nC00: 400 (effort 461)\nC01: 389 (effort 539)\nA10: 262 (effort 437)\n\nIf I include B33, A71, B32, C17, A87, C00: 594+175+695+313+4+461 = 2242 effort, giving me 668+583+508+484+461+400 = 3104 importance.\n\nI have 3386-2242 = 1144 effort left. I could add C01 (539 effort, 389 importance) for total effort 2781 and total importance 3493. \n\nI still have 605 effort remaining. Adding A10 (437 effort, 262 importance) brings my total effort to 3218 and importance to 3755. I'm left with 168 effort, but A04 would push me over the limit.\n\nI'll need to strategize a compromise that balances their preferences with my optimal value.\n\nFrom their suggested items, I see four that are genuinely valuable to me: A87 at 461, C01 at 389, C00 at 400, and A10 at 262. The other items like A04, C54, and B86 don't offer much benefit from my perspective.\n\nMy goal is to craft a proposal that incorporates these high-value items while meeting both our needs.",

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."
