        <p>Let me analyze this step by step.<br/><br/>First, let me understand what I have:<br/>- Total effort limit: 3386<br/>- Item efforts: {&quot;C17&quot;: 313, &quot;B41&quot;: 720, &quot;A71&quot;: 175, &quot;C00&quot;: 461, &quot;B35&quot;: 635, &quot;A77&quot;: 685, &quot;A03&quot;: 544, &quot;A04&quot;: 203, &quot;C54&quot;: 369, &quot;C01&quot;: 539, &quot;A87&quot;: 4, &quot;B32&quot;: 695, &quot;B86&quot;: 399, &quot;B33&quot;: 594, &quot;A10&quot;: 437}<br/>- My importance values: {&quot;C17&quot;: 138, &quot;B41&quot;: 583, &quot;A71&quot;: 65, &quot;C00&quot;: 262, &quot;B35&quot;: 121, &quot;A77&quot;: 508, &quot;A03&quot;: 461, &quot;A04&quot;: 484, &quot;C54&quot;: 668, &quot;C01&quot;: 389, &quot;A87&quot;: 215, &quot;B32&quot;: 97, &quot;B86&quot;: 500, &quot;B33&quot;: 30, &quot;A10&quot;: 400}<br/><br/>I need to find items that give me the best importance-to-effort ratio and try to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit.<br/><br/>Let me calculate importance/effort ratios:<br/>- C17: 138/313 = 0.44<br/>- B41: 583/720 = 0.81<br/>- A71: 65/175 = 0.37<br/>- C00: 262/461 = 0.57<br/>- B35: 121/635 = 0.19<br/>- A77: 508/685 = 0.74<br/>- A03: 461/544 = 0.85<br/>- A04: 484/203 = 2.38<br/>- C54: 668/369 = 1.81<br/>- C01: 389/539 = 0.72<br/>- A87: 215/4 = 53.75<br/><br/><br/>- B32: 97/695 = 0.14<br/>- B86: 500/399 = 1.25<br/>- B33: 30/594 = 0.05<br/>- A10: 400/437 = 0.92<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll continue ranking the items by their importance-to-effort ratio:<br/>9. C01: 0.72<br/>10. C00: 0.57<br/>11. C17: 0.44<br/>12. A71: 0.37<br/>13. B35: 0.19<br/>14. B32: 0.14<br/>15. B33: 0.05<br/><br/>The standout items are clearly A87 and A04, with exceptionally high ratios that make them prime candidates for selection.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m tracking the total effort carefully, currently at 3361, which is just below the 3386 limit. I&#x27;m looking to potentially squeeze in one more small item like C17, which would add minimal effort while potentially increasing overall value.<br/><br/>The strategy involves maximizing importance while keeping total effort constrained, carefully balancing each potential addition against the existing selections.<br/><br/>After precise calculations, I find no items small enough to fit within the remaining 25 effort. This confirms my current set as optimal: A87, A04, C54, B86, A10, A03, B41, and A77.<br/><br/>The final set achieves a total importance of 3819 with a total effort just under the maximum allowed, representing an efficient selection strategy.</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this proposal first:<br/><br/>The opponent proposed: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;}<br/><br/>Let me calculate the total effort:<br/>- A87: 4<br/>- A04: 203<br/>- C54: 369<br/>- B86: 399<br/>- A10: 437<br/>- A03: 544<br/>- B41: 720<br/>- A77: 685<br/><br/>Total effort = 4 + 203 + 369 + 399 + 437 + 544 + 720 + 685 = 3361<br/><br/>This is within the limit of 3386.<br/><br/>Now let me check my importance values for these items:<br/>- A87: 461<br/>- A04: 138<br/>- C54: 30<br/>- B86: 121<br/>- A10: 262<br/>- A03: 215<br/>- B41: 65<br/>- A77: 97<br/><br/>Total importance to me = 461 + 138 + 30 + 121 + 262 + 215 + 65 + 97 = 1389<br/><br/>Let me see if I can do better. I should look at my highest importance items and see if I can fit them:<br/><br/>My items ranked by importance:<br/>1. B33: 668 (effort: 594)<br/>2. A71: 583 (effort: 175) <br/>3. B32: 508 (effort: 695)<br/>4. C17: 484 (effort: 313)<br/>5. A87: 461 (effort: 4)<br/>6. C00: 400 (effort: 461)<br/>7. C01: 389 (effort: 539)<br/>8. A10: 262 (effort: 437)<br/>9. A03: 215 (effort: 544)<br/>10. <br/><br/>I&#x27;ll continue evaluating potential items to optimize my selection. The next set of items includes A04 with 138 importance and 138 effort, B86 with 121 importance and 399 effort, and A77 with 97 importance and 685 effort. I&#x27;m strategizing to maximize importance while staying within the effort limit. <br/><br/>I&#x27;m currently focusing on my top-ranked items: B33, A71, B32, and C17. These items offer the highest importance values with varying effort requirements. My goal is to construct a combination that provides maximum value while keeping the total effort under the 3386 limit.<br/><br/>By adding A10 with 262 importance and 437 effort, I can increase my total importance to 3755, which is significantly better than my previous result of 1389. This strategic selection leaves me with 168 effort remaining, providing flexibility for potential future adjustments. The A04 item doesn&#x27;t fit well with A10, so I&#x27;ll exclude it from my current optimization strategy.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ve carefully verified my proposed combination: B33, A71, B32, C17, A87, C00, C01, and A10. The total effort of 3218 is within my 3386 limit, confirming the feasibility of this approach. Given the clear advantages of my proposed selection, I&#x27;ll confidently reject their original proposal and develop my own strategic solution.</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent proposed a set that gives me only 1389 total importance (A87:461, A04:138, C54:30, B86:121, A10:262, A03:215, B41:65, A77:97).

But I can still do much better. Their proposal gives me 1801 importance, but I know I can get much more.<br/><br/>Let me try to find a better combination. My highest value items are:<br/>B33: 668 (effort 594)<br/>A71: 583 (effort 175)<br/>B32: 508 (effort 695)<br/>C17: 484 (effort 313)<br/>A87: 461 (effort 4)<br/>C00: 400 (effort 461)<br/>C01: 389 (effort 539)<br/>A10: 262 (effort 437)<br/><br/>If I include B33, A71, B32, C17, A87, C00: 594+175+695+313+4+461 = 2242 effort, giving me 668+583+508+484+461+400 = 3104 importance.<br/><br/>I have 3386-2242 = 1144 effort left. I could add C01 (539 effort, 389 importance) for total effort 2781 and total importance 3493. <br/><br/>I still have 605 effort remaining. Adding A10 (437 effort, 262 importance) brings my total effort to 3218 and importance to 3755. I&#x27;m left with 168 effort, but A04 would push me over the limit.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll need to strategize a compromise that balances their preferences with my optimal value.<br/><br/>From their suggested items, I see four that are genuinely valuable to me: A87 at 461, C01 at 389, C00 at 400, and A10 at 262. The other items like A04, C54, and B86 don&#x27;t offer much benefit from my perspective.<br/><br/>My goal is to craft a proposal that incorporates these high-value items while meeting both our needs.</p>

This would boost my total importance to 2459, which while not optimal, might be an acceptable compromise if they refuse to budge further.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your proposal shows good collaborative instincts and I want to build on that foundation.

This demonstrates how we can work together effectively while ensuring neither of us leaves potential value on the table.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>Let me calculate the total effort of their proposal:<br/>A87: 4<br/>B86: 399<br/>B33: 594<br/>A71: 175<br/>B32: 695<br/>C17: 313<br/>C00: 461<br/>A04: 203<br/>C54: 369<br/><br/>Total: 4 + 399 + 594 + 175 + 695 + 313 + 461 + 203 + 369 = 3213<br/><br/>This is within the limit of 3386.<br/><br/>My importance scores for these items:<br/>A87: 461<br/>B86: 121<br/>B33: 668<br/>A71: 583<br/>B32: 508<br/>C17: 484<br/>C00: 400<br/>A04: 138<br/>C54: 30<br/><br/>Total importance to me: 461 + 121 + 668 + 583 + 508 + 484 + 400 + 138 + 30 = 3393<br/><br/>This is actually quite good! It includes my top 3 items (B33:668, A71:583, B32:508) plus C17:484 and A87:461, giving me very high value. The only low-value items for me are B86:121, A04:138, and C54:30, but the total is still excellent at 3393 importance.<br/><br/>Should I accept this or try to push for more? Given that we&#x27;ve been going back and forth and they&#x27;ve included most of my high-value items, this might be a good deal to accept. Let me see if I could do better with a counter-proposal, but the effort budget is getting tight.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal gives me 3393 total importance (A87:461, B86:121, B33:668, A71:583, B32:508, C17:484, C00:400, A04:138, C54:30), which is excellent! They included my top 5 highest-value items (B33, A71, B32, C17, A87) which account for most of my value. Only the bottom 3 items (B86, A04, C54) are low-value for me, totaling just 289. The effort is 3213, within the limit. This is a very good deal - I get 3393 out of my maximum possible importance. I should accept this proposal.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;You have crafted an excellent compromise that demonstrates strong negotiation skills. This selection captures the most valuable items from both our perspectives while making efficient use of our effort budget at 3213 out of 3386. The inclusion of the core high-impact items alongside the supplementary ones creates a well-balanced portfolio that maximizes our collective benefit. I am satisfied with this mutually beneficial agreement.&#x27;}</p>
