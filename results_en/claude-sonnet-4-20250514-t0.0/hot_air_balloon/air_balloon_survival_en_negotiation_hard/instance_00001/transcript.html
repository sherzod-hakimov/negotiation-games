These items have very poor efficiency ratios. We need to include items that truly maximize our collective benefit. A10 and C00 provide much better value-to-effort ratios and should be central to any agreement. Let me propose a more balanced approach that includes these critical high-efficiency items.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal gives me only 2741 importance using 3041 effort. They keep insisting on A10 (138 importance to me, 366 effort) and C00 (121 importance to me, 665 effort) which are terrible ratios for me. Meanwhile A77 gives me 868 importance for only 77 effort - that&#x27;s over 11 importance per effort unit! I need to be firm about including my highest-value items while showing some flexibility by including one of their preferred items.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I understand you value C00 highly, so I included it in this proposal as a gesture of compromise. However, I must insist on items like A77 which provides exceptional efficiency - it delivers massive value for minimal effort investment. This combination uses 3644 effort, staying well under our limit, and includes your preferred C00 while ensuring we both benefit significantly from our collaboration.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent\&#x27;s proposal gives me only 2258 total importance - much worse than my previous proposals. They claim A77 provides &quot;exceptional efficiency&quot; but it gives me only 65 importance for 77 effort. C17 is even worse at 138 importance for 780 effort (0.18 ratio). They included C00 as a compromise but surrounded it with very inefficient items for me.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal gives me only 2741 importance using 3041 effort - not good for me. They consistently refuse A77 despite its incredible 868/77 ratio. They seem to highly value A10, C00, B86, B32, C54 which are moderate to me. I should try a different tactic - accept most of their core items but insist on A77 as a non-negotiable due to its exceptional efficiency. This shows flexibility while protecting my key interest.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I recognize the value you place on your core items, so I have accepted almost your entire proposal including A10, C00, and B86. However, I must insist on including A77 as it requires minimal effort (only 77 units) while providing significant value. This combination uses 3118 effort, leaving us plenty of room under the 4026 limit, and demonstrates my willingness to compromise while including one truly efficient item that benefits our collaboration.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent has accepted almost my entire proposal, including all my high-efficiency items: B35, A10, C00, B86, A87, B32, and C54. They only added A77 which gives me 65 importance for 77 effort - not great efficiency but minimal cost. This proposal gives me 4599 total importance compared to 4534 from my version without A77. Given that they\&#x27;ve compromised so much by accepting my core items, and A77 adds only 77 effort while we have plenty of room under the 4026 limit, this seems like a fair deal I should accept.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;You have shown excellent collaborative spirit by accepting my most valued items including A10, C00, and B86.
