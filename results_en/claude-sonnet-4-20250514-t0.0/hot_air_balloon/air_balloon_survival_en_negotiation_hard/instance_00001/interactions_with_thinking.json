The top performers stand out clearly: B35 has an exceptional 5.593 ratio, followed by A10 with 2.208. These items provide the most value relative to their effort. A87 and B86 also show strong potential, with ratios above 1.295. This analysis will help me strategically allocate my limited resources.\n\nI'm calculating cumulative effort by adding items sequentially: B35 (140) + A10 (366) = 506, then adding A87 (319) brings the total to 825. B86 (516) would push the effort to 1,341, and C00 (665) would exceed 2,000. I'll need to carefully balance efficiency with total effort constraints.\n\nAfter strategic selection, I've assembled a combination totaling 3,866 with B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, B32, C01, and C54. This leaves just 160 in remaining capacity, which is quite tight. I could potentially swap C54 for a smaller item like A77 to optimize the selection, giving more flexibility in the final configuration.\n\nThe total importance of these components sums to an impressive 5,314, suggesting a carefully balanced approach to maximizing value within the constraints.",
