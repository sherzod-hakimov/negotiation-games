          "thinking": "Let me analyze this negotiation game step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what I have:\n- LIMIT = 4026 (total effort cannot exceed this)\n- Item efforts and my importance values for each item\n\nLet me calculate the efficiency (importance/effort ratio) for each item to help guide my strategy:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 780, \"B41\": 742, \"A71\": 997, \"C00\": 665, \"B35\": 140, \"A77\": 77, \"A03\": 513, \"A04\": 383, \"C54\": 587, \"C01\": 825, \"A87\": 319, \"B32\": 448, \"B86\": 516, \"B33\": 694, \"A10\": 366}\n\nItem importance = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}\n\nEfficiency ratios (importance/effort):\n- C17: 138/780 = 0.177\n- B41: 583/742 = 0.786\n- A71: 868/997 = 0.871\n- C00: 822/665 = 1.236\n- B35: 783/140 = 5.593\n- A77: 65/77 = 0.844\n- A03: 262/513 = 0.511\n- A04: 121/383 = 0.316\n- C54: 508/587 = 0.865\n- C01: 780/825 = 0.945\n\n\n- A87: 461/319 = 1.445\n- B32: 484/448 = 1.080\n- B86: 668/516 = 1.295\n- B33: 389/694 = 0.561\n- A10: 808/366 = 2.208\n\nI'll prioritize items with the highest efficiency ratios. The top performers stand out clearly: B35 has an exceptional 5.593 ratio, followed by A10 with 2.208. These items provide the most value relative to their effort. A87 and B86 also show strong potential, with ratios above 1.295. This analysis will help me strategically allocate my limited resources.\n\nI'm calculating cumulative effort by adding items sequentially: B35 (140) + A10 (366) = 506, then adding A87 (319) brings the total to 825. B86 (516) would push the effort to 1,341, and C00 (665) would exceed 2,000. I'll need to carefully balance efficiency with total effort constraints.\n\nAfter strategic selection, I've assembled a combination totaling 3,866 with B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, B32, C01, and C54. This leaves just 160 in remaining capacity, which is quite tight. I could potentially swap C54 for a smaller item like A77 to optimize the selection, giving more flexibility in the final configuration.\n\nThe total importance of these components sums to an impressive 5,314, suggesting a carefully balanced approach to maximizing value within the constraints.",

Let me look at my highest importance items:\n- A77: 868 (effort: 77)\n- A04: 822 (effort: 383)\n- C17: 808 (effort: 780)\n- A03: 783 (effort: 513)\n- B33: 780 (effort: 694)\n\nLet me try to construct a better set for myself.

The cumulative effort reaches 3804, which is still comfortably under the 4026 limit. This combination gives me a higher total importance of 5812 compared to the original proposal's 3130. I've strategically included some items from their original proposal while adding my highest-value items to create a more advantageous selection.\n\nBy incorporating B35 with its 262 importance and 140 effort, I can boost my total importance to 6082. This refined counter-proposal significantly outperforms their initial suggestion, making it a compelling alternative. The total effort of 3941 remains well within the constraints, providing a strong rationale for presenting this new configuration.",

Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 4026\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 780, \"B41\": 742, \"A71\": 997, \"C00\": 665, \"B35\": 140, \"A77\": 77, \"A03\": 513, \"A04\": 383, \"C54\": 587, \"C01\": 825, \"A87\": 319, \"B32\": 448, \"B86\": 516, \"B33\": 694, \"A10\": 366}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 4026\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 780, \"B41\": 742, \"A71\": 997, \"C00\": 665, \"B35\": 140, \"A77\": 77, \"A03\": 513, \"A04\": 383, \"C54\": 587, \"C01\": 825, \"A87\": 319, \"B32\": 448, \"B86\": 516, \"B33\": 694, \"A10\": 366}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"A71\": 65, \"C00\": 121, \"A10\": 138, \"B35\": 262, \"C01\": 389, \"B86\": 461, \"B41\": 484, \"C54\": 508, \"B32\": 583, \"A87\": 668, \"B33\": 780, \"A03\": 783, \"C17\": 808, \"A04\": 822, \"A77\": 868}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 4026\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 780, \"B41\": 742, \"A71\": 997, \"C00\": 665, \"B35\": 140, \"A77\": 77, \"A03\": 513, \"A04\": 383, \"C54\": 587, \"C01\": 825, \"A87\": 319, \"B32\": 448, \"B86\": 516, \"B33\": 694, \"A10\": 366}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.
