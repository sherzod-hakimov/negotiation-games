B35: 1.494 (effort: 524, importance: 783)\n2. B32: 1.155 (effort: 419, importance: 484)\n3. A10: 1.107 (effort: 730, importance: 808)\n4. C00: 1.102 (effort: 746, importance: 822)\n5.

My initial combination looks promising, focusing on items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios to maximize value within the shared effort limit.\n\nAfter adding B35, B32, A10, and C00, I've reached a total effort of 3269 with an importance score of 3765. I then successfully incorporated C01, pushing the total effort to 4124 and importance to 4545. Adding A87 further increased the total to 4654 with an importance of 5006.\n\nWith only 484 effort remaining, I cannot include any additional items. The selection process has efficiently utilized the available capacity while maximizing overall importance.\n\nI've identified A77 and A04 as potential candidates. By adding A04, I reach a total effort of 5127 and an importance of 5127, leaving just 11 units of capacity unused.\n\nThe final optimal proposal includes {B35, B32, A10, C00, A71, C01, A87, A04}, precisely balancing the total effort and importance at 5127.",

This low-effort, high-value item stands out immediately. I'll strategize around incorporating this gem while maximizing overall value.\n\nI'll focus on combining top-tier items with manageable effort:\nA77: 868 importance, 204 effort\nA04: 822 importance, 473 effort (already in their proposal)\nC17: 808 importance, 903 effort\n\nMy initial combination looks promising, balancing high importance with reasonable total effort.\n\n, B33, A87, B32\nEfforts: 204 + 473 + 903 + 763 + 530 + 419 = 3292\nImportance: 868 + 822 + 808 + 780 + 668 + 583 = 4529\n\nI've got substantial room to maneuver with 1846 effort remaining. Scanning potential additions, I see C54 and B41 could seamlessly integrate without overextending. C01 pushes me past the acceptable threshold, so I'll hold off.\n\nMy refined selection maximizes value while staying within constraints.\n\n, B41\nTotal efforts now climb to 4665, with importance reaching 5521. My remaining effort buffer shrinks to a mere 473. Systematically evaluating potential additions reveals no viable candidates - each option exceeds my remaining capacity.\n\nI'm confronting a tight optimization challenge.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

They keep including A77 (65 importance, 204 effort) and now added A03 (262 importance, 946 effort) which is terrible efficiency.\n\nThey seem to really want A04, A87, B32, B33. Let me try one more compromise keeping these 4 core items but adding my most efficient remaining items to maximize value within the limit.\n\nCore 4 they want: A04(473), A87(530), B32(419), B33(763) = 2185 effort, giving me 121+461+484+389 = 1455 importance\n\nRemaining capacity: 5138 - 2185 = 2953\n\nBest items I can fit:\n- B35: 524 effort, 783 importance (ratio 1.494)\n- A10: 730 effort, 808 importance (ratio 1.107) \n- C00: 746 effort, 822 importance (ratio 1.102)\n- A71: 850 effort, 868 importance (ratio 1.021)\n\nB35 + A10 = 1254 effort, 1591 importance\nB35 + C00 = 1270 effort, 1605 importance  \nB35 + A71 = 1374 effort, 1651 importance\nA10 + C00 = 1476 effort, 1630 importance\n\n\nA10 + A71 = 1580 effort, 1676 importance\nC00 + A71 = 1596 effort, 1690 importance\n\nI've discovered an optimal combination that maximizes both effort and importance. By adding B35, A10, and C00, I can achieve 2000 effort and 2413 importance, with potential for further optimization. Alternatively, replacing A10 with A71 increases effort to 2120 and importance to 2473.\n\nCalculating the total, I find the comprehensive package would reach 2185 + 2850 = 5035 effort, representing a significant improvement in overall value.\n\nWithin acceptable parameters!

Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 5138\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 903, \"B41\": 757, \"A71\": 850, \"C00\": 746, \"B35\": 524, \"A77\": 204, \"A03\": 946, \"A04\": 473, \"C54\": 616, \"C01\": 855, \"A87\": 530, \"B32\": 419, \"B86\": 960, \"B33\": 763, \"A10\": 730}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 5138\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 903, \"B41\": 757, \"A71\": 850, \"C00\": 746, \"B35\": 524, \"A77\": 204, \"A03\": 946, \"A04\": 473, \"C54\": 616, \"C01\": 855, \"A87\": 530, \"B32\": 419, \"B86\": 960, \"B33\": 763, \"A10\": 730}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 868, \"C00\": 822, \"B35\": 783, \"A77\": 65, \"A03\": 262, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 508, \"C01\": 780, \"A87\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B86\": 668, \"B33\": 389, \"A10\": 808}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

A77 adds very little value to me (65 importance for 204 effort = 0.318 ratio), but it's not terrible given that I'm getting all my high-value items. This could be a reasonable deal to accept since they've included all my preferred items and we're using most of our capacity efficiently.",
