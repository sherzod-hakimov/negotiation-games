The top performers are C00, A71, and B35, offering exceptional value. These items provide maximum importance with minimal effort expended. I'll start selecting these high-efficiency items to optimize my overall strategy.\n\nMy initial set combines these top-ranked items, totaling 2146 in effort and generating 3503 in importance. I'm carefully balancing resource investment against potential returns, seeking the most impactful combination. The selected items represent a strategic approach to maximizing efficiency and output.\n\nI notice there's room for further optimization, with potential to refine the selection and potentially improve the overall importance-to-effort ratio. The current set shows promise, but might benefit from careful recalibration.\n\nBy adding B41, which requires 542 effort and contributes 583 importance, I can enhance the overall value. This strategic addition brings the total effort to 2688, still comfortably under the limit, and increases the importance to 4086. The calculated approach allows for precise selection while maintaining strict resource constraints.\n\nA subsequent evaluation reveals A10 can also be incorporated, fitting within the remaining effort budget. This final adjustment elevates the total importance to 4586, creating a comprehensive and optimized set that maximizes potential impact while respecting resource limitations."

I could accept this or try one more counter-proposal to get A77 instead of A87.\n\nGiven that they've been rejecting my proposals that include A77, maybe I should accept this reasonable offer that gives me 4137 importance."
