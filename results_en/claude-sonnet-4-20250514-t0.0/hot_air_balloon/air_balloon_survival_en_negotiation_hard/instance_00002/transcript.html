Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 3481<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;C17&quot;: 777, &quot;B41&quot;: 542, &quot;A71&quot;: 332, &quot;C00&quot;: 1, &quot;B35&quot;: 127, &quot;A77&quot;: 453, &quot;A03&quot;: 736, &quot;A04&quot;: 461, &quot;C54&quot;: 359, &quot;C01&quot;: 313, &quot;A87&quot;: 553, &quot;B32&quot;: 409, &quot;B86&quot;: 348, &quot;B33&quot;: 802, &quot;A10&quot;: 749}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;C17&quot;: 138, &quot;B41&quot;: 583, &quot;A71&quot;: 783, &quot;C00&quot;: 65, &quot;B35&quot;: 262, &quot;A77&quot;: 121, &quot;A03&quot;: 508, &quot;A04&quot;: 780, &quot;C54&quot;: 461, &quot;C01&quot;: 484, &quot;A87&quot;: 668, &quot;B32&quot;: 389, &quot;B86&quot;: 215, &quot;B33&quot;: 97, &quot;A10&quot;: 500}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent is repeating the exact same proposal, suggesting they really value those specific items. Their proposal gives me only 1748 importance vs my 4586, so it&#x27;s terrible for me. But they seem stuck on B33, A77, C17 which suggests these might be very valuable to them. I need to find middle ground - maybe keep some of their preferred items but swap out the worst ones for me. Let me try including B33 and B32 (which they want) but replace the terrible A77 and C17 with my high-value A71 and A04.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I understand you value B33 and B32, so I included them in this compromise. However, A77 and C17 have very poor efficiency ratios. By replacing them with A71 and A04, we get much better value while using only 3250 effort - still well within our 3481 limit. This balanced approach respects your preferences while improving our overall outcome.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent is making some compromises by including B33 and B32, which gives me 3678 importance - better than their previous offers but still short of my 4767 target. They included A71 and A04 which have very low value to me (65 and 97). I should propose replacing these with A77 which has much higher value to me (668). This would significantly improve my outcome while still being reasonable.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I appreciate your willingness to include B33 and B32, which shows good faith negotiation. However, A71 and A04 are extremely inefficient choices that drag down our overall value. By removing them and keeping A77, we achieve much better efficiency while using only 2823 effort - giving us substantial room under our 3481 limit.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent is making small concessions - they removed C17 from their original proposal and now removed A71/A04 from mine. Their current proposal gives me 1610 importance vs my original 4586. They seem fixated on B33, B32, B86, B35, C54 but dropped the worst item C17. Since they have room under the limit (2499 effort used), I can try one more swap - replace A77 (terrible for me at 121 importance) with A87 (668 importance) which only adds 100 more effort. This might be my final compromise attempt.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your proposal shows good progress by removing the inefficient items, but A77 still represents poor value. Since we only use 2499 effort in your current proposal, we have room to upgrade A77 to A87 for just 100 additional effort. This gives us significantly better returns while still using only 2599 total effort - well under our 3481 limit. This small adjustment creates much better overall value.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;The opponent&#x27;s latest proposal gives me 4137 importance, which is significantly better than their previous offers and reasonably close to my target. They replaced A77 (668 importance to me) with A87 (121 importance to me), but this is still a good compromise. The total effort is only 2599, well within the limit. Given their consistent rejection of A77, this might be the best deal I can get.

This proposal represents a solid compromise that balances both our interests while staying well within our effort constraint.
