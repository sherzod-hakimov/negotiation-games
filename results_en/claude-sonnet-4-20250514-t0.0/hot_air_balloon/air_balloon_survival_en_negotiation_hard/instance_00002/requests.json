The top performers are C00, A71, and B35, offering exceptional value. These items provide maximum importance with minimal effort expended. I'll start selecting these high-efficiency items to optimize my overall strategy.\n\nMy initial set combines these top-ranked items, totaling 2146 in effort and generating 3503 in importance. I'm carefully balancing resource investment against potential returns, seeking the most impactful combination. The selected items represent a strategic approach to maximizing efficiency and output.\n\nI notice there's room for further optimization, with potential to refine the selection and potentially improve the overall importance-to-effort ratio. The current set shows promise, but might benefit from careful recalibration.\n\nBy adding B41, which requires 542 effort and contributes 583 importance, I can enhance the overall value. This strategic addition brings the total effort to 2688, still comfortably under the limit, and increases the importance to 4086. The calculated approach allows for precise selection while maintaining strict resource constraints.\n\nA subsequent evaluation reveals A10 can also be incorporated, fitting within the remaining effort budget. This final adjustment elevates the total importance to 4586, creating a comprehensive and optimized set that maximizes potential impact while respecting resource limitations.",

Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3481\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 777, \"B41\": 542, \"A71\": 332, \"C00\": 1, \"B35\": 127, \"A77\": 453, \"A03\": 736, \"A04\": 461, \"C54\": 359, \"C01\": 313, \"A87\": 553, \"B32\": 409, \"B86\": 348, \"B33\": 802, \"A10\": 749}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"A71\": 65, \"A04\": 97, \"A87\": 121, \"B41\": 138, \"A03\": 215, \"A10\": 262, \"C01\": 389, \"C54\": 461, \"B32\": 484, \"B35\": 500, \"B86\": 508, \"C17\": 583, \"A77\": 668, \"B33\": 780, \"C00\": 783}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

C00 is a must-include with its minimal effort and high importance. B35 looks promising with its excellent effort-to-importance balance. I'll carefully consider each item's potential contribution to maximize overall value while keeping total effort under the limit.\n\nAfter initial selection, I've assembled a set with strong potential: C00, B33, A77, B86, B35, and B32. This combination yields 3723 importance points across 2140 effort units. I spot an opportunity to optimize by adding C54, which fits within my remaining effort budget and boosts total importance.\n\nWith C54 integrated, my set now reaches 4184 importance using 2499 effort. I still have 982 effort remaining, which allows potential further refinement. C17 looks like another candidate worth evaluating for potential inclusion.\n\nAfter adding C17, my total effort climbs to 3276, with importance rising to 4767. At this point, I've exhausted most viable additions given my strict 3481 effort constraint. I've carefully screened smaller items like C01, A71, and others, confirming they exceed my remaining capacity.\n\nMy final proposed set represents a strategic selection maximizing importance while staying within defined effort limitations.",

Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3481\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 777, \"B41\": 542, \"A71\": 332, \"C00\": 1, \"B35\": 127, \"A77\": 453, \"A03\": 736, \"A04\": 461, \"C54\": 359, \"C01\": 313, \"A87\": 553, \"B32\": 409, \"B86\": 348, \"B33\": 802, \"A10\": 749}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"C17\": 138, \"B41\": 583, \"A71\": 783, \"C00\": 65, \"B35\": 262, \"A77\": 121, \"A03\": 508, \"A04\": 780, \"C54\": 461, \"C01\": 484, \"A87\": 668, \"B32\": 389, \"B86\": 215, \"B33\": 97, \"A10\": 500}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

Their new proposal is: {'C00', 'B33', 'A87', 'B86', 'B35', 'B32', 'C54'}\n\nLet me calculate the total importance this gives me:\n- C00: 783\n- B33: 780\n- A87: 121\n- B86: 508\n- B35: 500\n- B32: 484\n- C54: 461\n\nTotal importance = 783 + 780 + 121 + 508 + 500 + 484 + 461 = 4137\n\nLet me check the effort:\n- C00: 1\n- B33: 802\n- A87: 553\n- B86: 348\n- B35: 127\n- B32: 409\n- C54: 359\n\nTotal effort = 1 + 802 + 553 + 348 + 127 + 409 + 359 = 2599\n\nThis is well within the 3481 limit.\n\nThis proposal gives me 4137 importance, which is much better than their previous offers and getting closer to my ideal. However, I still prefer A77 (668 importance) over A87 (121 importance). But this is a reasonable compromise that's moving in the right direction. I could accept this or try one more counter-proposal to get A77 instead of A87.\n\nGiven that they've been rejecting my proposals that include A77, maybe I should accept this reasonable offer that gives me 4137 importance.",
