The proposal that makes the most sense given our conversation is for me to take the bolt and picture, and let them have the 4 cards and egg.\n\nMy values: bolt (6), picture (4), egg (0), card (0)\nSo if I get bolt and picture, my score would be 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nThis seems like the logical proposal based on our negotiation.",
