        <p>Let me understand this:<br/><br/>1. Items available: 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards<br/>2. My values: bolt: 6, picture: 4, egg: 0, card: 0<br/>3. Goal: maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores<br/>4. I need to negotiate with the other player to divide items<br/><br/>Since I value the bolt at 6 and the picture at 4, but the egg and cards at 0, I should try to get the bolt and picture if possible. However, since the goal is to maximize the total score, I need to find out what the other player values.<br/><br/>I should start by communicating with them to understand their preferences without revealing my exact values.</p>

        <p>The human is starting the negotiation game. Let me analyze the situation:<br/><br/>Available items: 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards<br/>My values: bolt: 0, picture: 1, egg: 1, card: 2<br/><br/>The human says they are &quot;particularly interested in the bolt and picture&quot; but then asks about my preferences. However, I should be careful - they might be misleading me about their true preferences.<br/><br/>Since my goal is to maximize the combined score, I should try to figure out their true value function and propose a division that maximizes total utility.<br/><br/>My most valuable items are the cards (2 points each), so ideally I&#x27;d want as many cards as possible. The bolt is worthless to me (0 points), so if they really want it, that would be great for both of us.<br/><br/>I should respond honestly about my preferences while trying to gather information about theirs. I shouldn&#x27;t reveal my exact values, but I can indicate relative preferences.</p>

        <p>Hello! I&#x27;m glad we can work together on this. I&#x27;m most interested in the cards - they&#x27;re quite valuable to me. The bolt isn&#x27;t particularly useful for me, so if you&#x27;re interested in that, it could work well for both of us. I also have some interest in the picture and egg, but not as much as the cards. What&#x27;s your relative ranking of the different items?</p>

        <p>Great! The other player is most interested in the cards (which I value at 0), and they said the bolt isn&#x27;t particularly useful to them (which I value at 6 - my highest value item). This looks like a great opportunity for mutual benefit.<br/><br/>They also have some interest in the picture and egg, but not as much as the cards. I value the picture at 4 and the egg at 0, so if they want the egg that&#x27;s fine with me, but I&#x27;d prefer to keep the picture if possible.<br/><br/>Let me share my preferences while being strategic about maximizing our joint score.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>That sounds like a great match! My ranking from most to least valuable would be: bolt (very high value to me), picture (moderate value), and then egg and cards are both low value for me. <br/><br/>Since you&#x27;re most interested in the cards and I don&#x27;t need them, and I&#x27;m most interested in the bolt which you don&#x27;t need much, we have a really good foundation for a deal. For the remaining items - the picture and egg - I have a slight preference for the picture, but if you&#x27;d find the egg useful, I&#x27;d be happy for you to take it. <br/><br/>How does this division sound to you: I take the bolt and picture, you take all 4 cards and the egg?</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this proposed division:<br/><br/>Their proposal: <br/>- They get: bolt, picture<br/>- I get: 4 cards, egg<br/><br/>Let me calculate the scores:<br/><br/>My values: bolt: 0, picture: 1, egg: 1, card: 2<br/><br/>If I get 4 cards and 1 egg:<br/>My score = 4 × 2 + 1 × 1 = 8 + 1 = 9<br/><br/>If they get bolt and picture, and their stated values are bolt (very high), picture (moderate), egg and cards (both low), then they should get a good score too.<br/><br/>This seems like a very good deal for me since I get all the cards (my highest value items) plus the egg. And it seems fair for them since they get the bolt which they value very highly.<br/><br/>Let me accept this proposal.</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent division! You&#x27;re absolutely right that we have a great match - you get the bolt which is very valuable to you, plus the picture which you prefer, and I get all the cards which are my top priority plus the egg. This should give us both good scores and maximize our combined total.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m ready to agree to this: you take the bolt and picture, I take all 4 cards and the egg.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 4 cards, 1 egg]</p>

        <p>The other player has submitted their secret proposal, so now I need to submit mine. Based on our conversation:<br/><br/>- They said cards are most valuable to them<br/>- They said the bolt isn&#x27;t particularly useful to them<br/>- They have some interest in picture and egg but less than cards<br/>- I told them bolt is very high value to me, picture is moderate value, egg and cards are low value<br/>- I proposed: I take bolt and picture, they take all 4 cards and the egg<br/><br/>Since they&#x27;ve already submitted their proposal, I should submit mine based on what we discussed. The proposal that makes the most sense given our conversation is for me to take the bolt and picture, and let them have the 4 cards and egg.<br/><br/>My values: bolt (6), picture (4), egg (0), card (0)<br/>So if I get bolt and picture, my score would be 6 + 4 = 10.<br/><br/>This seems like the logical proposal based on our negotiation.</p>
