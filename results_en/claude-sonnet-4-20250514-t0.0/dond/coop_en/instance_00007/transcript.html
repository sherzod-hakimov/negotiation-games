        <p>I&#x27;m most interested in the bowl - that&#x27;s definitely my top priority. The hooks have some value to me as well, but I&#x27;m not particularly interested in the plates. What about you - which items are you hoping to get?</p>

        <p>That works out well! I&#x27;m most interested in the hooks - they&#x27;re quite valuable to me. The plates have some value to me too, though not as much. Since you&#x27;re prioritizing the bowl and I&#x27;m prioritizing the hooks, how about you take the bowl and I take the two hooks? What are your thoughts on the plates?</p>

        <p>That sounds perfect! Since the plates have no value to me but you mentioned they have some value to you, why don&#x27;t you take both plates along with the two hooks? That way you get the hooks you really want plus the plates, and I get the bowl which is what I value most. This seems like it would maximize both our scores.<br/><br/>So to confirm: you would get the 2 hooks and 2 plates, and I would get the 1 bowl. Does that work for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds perfect! Yes, I&#x27;m very happy with that arrangement - I get the hooks which are most valuable to me, plus the plates which still have some worth. And you get your top priority item, the bowl. This definitely seems like it maximizes both our scores.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 2 hooks, 2 plates]</p>
