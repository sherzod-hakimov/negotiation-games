They seemed to agree with my suggestion that I would take the chalk and pliers while they take the nail and bucket.\n\nSo the division we discussed was:\n- Me: 2 pliers + 1 chalk \n- Them: 1 nail + 1 bucket\n\nLet me calculate my score from this:\n- 2 pliers \u00d7 2 points each = 4 points\n- 1 chalk \u00d7 3 points = 3 points\n- Total for me: 7 points\n\nSince they already submitted their proposal, I should submit mine based on our discussion."
