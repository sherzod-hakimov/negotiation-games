They said:\n- They're \"most interested in threads\" - so threads have high value\n- \"The doll would be nice to have as well\" - moderate value  \n- \"The bells aren't particularly valuable to me personally\" - low value\n\nThis seems like a reasonable division. Let me think if there's a better option:\n\nTotal items: 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads\nTotal possible value for me: 1+1+2+3+3 = 10\nUnder this proposal I get: 5 points\nThat means the other player would get the remaining value from their perspective.\n\nSince we both value threads highly and they're getting 1 thread + 1 doll (which they said they'd like), while I get 1 thread + 2 bells, this seems like a fair split that should give us both decent value.\n\nI think this is a good proposal to accept.",
