        <p>I&#x27;m most interested in the threads - they seem quite useful to me. The doll would be nice to have as well. The bells aren&#x27;t particularly valuable to me personally. What about you - which items do you find most appealing or useful?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s helpful to know! I actually find the threads quite valuable too, so we both seem to appreciate those. The doll is moderately appealing to me, and the bells are my least preferred items as well.<br/><br/>Since we both value the threads highly, perhaps we could each take one thread? That way we both get something we really want. Then for the remaining items - the doll and 2 bells - what would work best for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a fair approach! Yes, I&#x27;d be happy with each of us taking one thread since we both value them.<br/><br/>For the remaining items, since you mentioned the doll is moderately appealing to you and the bells are least preferred for both of us, would you be okay if I took the doll and you took both bells? That way you&#x27;d have 1 thread and 2 bells, and I&#x27;d have 1 thread and 1 doll. Does that division sound reasonable to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a very reasonable division! I&#x27;m happy with that arrangement - it makes sense that you get the doll since you mentioned it would be nice to have, and I can work with the two bells.
