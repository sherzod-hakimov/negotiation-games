Based on our conversation:\n\n- We both value threads highly\n- I value: bell: 0, doll: 2, thread: 4\n- The other player said threads are \"quite valuable\" to them too\n- They said doll is \"moderately appealing\" \n- They said bells are \"least preferred\" for both of us\n\nIn our discussion, I proposed that I take 1 thread and 1 doll, while they take 1 thread and 2 bells.\n\nIf they submitted that as their proposal, they would want: 1 thread, 2 bells\nThat would leave for me: 1 thread, 1 doll\n\nLet me check if this maximizes our joint score:\n- Me: 1 thread (4 points) + 1 doll (2 points) = 6 points\n- Them: 1 thread + 2 bells (I don't know their exact values, but they said threads are valuable and bells are least preferred)\n\nI should propose what we discussed: 1 thread and 1 doll for me.",
