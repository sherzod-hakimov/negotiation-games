Since they're offering me the statues (which I value highly) plus the nail, and they seem very happy to get just the hammer, this seems like a great deal for both of us.\n\nThis proposal maximizes the joint benefit since:\n1. I get the items I value most (statues = 9 points)\n2. They get their top priority item (hammer)\n3. The nail goes to me since they said they have only mild interest in it\n\nI should agree to this split.",
