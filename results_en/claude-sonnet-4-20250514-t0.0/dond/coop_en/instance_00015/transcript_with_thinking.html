You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>3 statues, 1 nail, 1 hammer<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>statue: 3, nail: 1, hammer: 0<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items:<br/>- 3 statues<br/>- 1 nail  <br/>- 1 hammer<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- statue: 3 points each<br/>- nail: 1 point<br/>- hammer: 0 points<br/><br/>So if I got all items, I&#x27;d get 3×3 + 1×1 + 1×0 = 10 points.<br/><br/>The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. This means I need to figure out what the other player values and try to give them items they value highly while keeping items I value highly.<br/><br/>Since I value statues the most (3 points each) and the hammer not at all (0 points), I should definitely try to keep the statues and give away the hammer. The nail is worth something to me (1 point) but not much.<br/><br/>I should start by trying to understand what the other player values without revealing my own values directly.</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>The other player says:<br/>- Hammer is their top priority<br/>- Statues don&#x27;t appeal to them much at all<br/>- Nail is just okay<br/>- They&#x27;re willing to let me have the statues<br/><br/>My value function is:<br/>- statue: 3 points each<br/>- nail: 1 point<br/>- hammer: 0 points<br/><br/>There are:<br/>- 3 statues<br/>- 1 nail  <br/>- 1 hammer<br/><br/>If I take all 3 statues, I get 3×3 = 9 points.<br/>The other player seems to want the hammer most, and they said statues don&#x27;t appeal to them much.<br/><br/>Since my goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores, and the other player really wants the hammer (which is worth 0 to me), and they&#x27;re willing to give me the statues (which are worth a lot to me), this seems like a great trade.<br/><br/>The question is what to do with the nail. They said it&#x27;s &quot;just okay&quot; to them, while it&#x27;s worth 1 point to me. But if giving them the nail makes them happier and doesn&#x27;t hurt the total much, that might be good for cooperation.<br/><br/>Let me respond positively about the statues and see what they think about the nail.</p>

        <p>That sounds perfect! I&#x27;m actually very interested in the statues - they would be quite valuable to me. Since you really want the hammer and I&#x27;m happy to take the statues, that seems like a great match.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on the nail? You mentioned it was just okay for you.

        <p>Let me think about this situation:<br/><br/>- The items are: 3 statues, 1 nail, 1 hammer<br/>- My values are: statue: 0, nail: 1, hammer: 9<br/>- The other player wants the statues and seems flexible about the nail<br/>- I want the hammer most (value 9)<br/>- The nail has some value to me (1) but not much<br/><br/>Since the other player is very interested in the statues (which have 0 value to me) and I really want the hammer, this is a great trade. The nail is the only remaining question.<br/><br/>The other player said they &quot;could use it&quot; but are &quot;flexible&quot; - this suggests they have some value for it but it&#x27;s not their top priority. Since my value for the nail is only 1, and the goal is to maximize our combined score, it might be better to let them have the nail if they value it more than I do.<br/><br/>Let me propose a split where I get the hammer and they get everything else (3 statues + 1 nail). This way:<br/>- I get 9 points (hammer)<br/>- They presumably get good value from the 3 statues + nail<br/>- Total combined score should be maximized</p>

        <p>That works perfectly! Since you really value the statues and I&#x27;m focused on the hammer, why don&#x27;t you take all 3 statues plus the nail?

        <p>Let me think about this proposed split:<br/>- Other player gets: 1 hammer<br/>- I get: 3 statues, 1 nail<br/><br/>Looking at my values:<br/>- 3 statues = 3 × 3 = 9 points<br/>- 1 nail = 1 × 1 = 1 point<br/>- Total for me: 10 points<br/><br/>The other player mentioned they really want the hammer (top priority), don&#x27;t care much about statues, and the nail is &quot;just okay&quot; for them. Since they&#x27;re offering me the statues (which I value highly) plus the nail, and they seem very happy to get just the hammer, this seems like a great deal for both of us.<br/><br/>This proposal maximizes the joint benefit since:<br/>1.
