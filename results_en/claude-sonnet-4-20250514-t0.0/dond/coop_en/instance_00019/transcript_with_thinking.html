You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items: 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- hook: 3 (2 hooks available, so total value 6)<br/>- flower: 3 (1 available)<br/>- card: 0 (1 available)<br/>- eraser: 1 (1 available)<br/>- sponge: 0 (1 available)<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. To do this optimally, I need to figure out what the other player values and try to arrange a trade where we each get the items we value most.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values yet, I should start by communicating and trying to understand their preferences. I should be strategic about this - I want to get information while not revealing too much about my own high-value items initially.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll start by asking about their preferences or suggesting a potential division to gauge their reaction.</p>

        <p>I need to be strategic here. My goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores, which means we need to cooperate effectively. Let me analyze my values:<br/><br/>- hook: 0 (I don&#x27;t care about these at all)<br/>- flower: 2 (moderate value)<br/>- card: 1 (low value)<br/>- eraser: 4 (highest value for me)<br/>- sponge: 3 (second highest value)<br/><br/>The items available are: 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge<br/><br/>Since I value the hooks at 0, I should be willing to give both hooks to the other player if they want them. My priorities should be:<br/>1. Eraser (4 points)<br/>2. Sponge (3 points)<br/>3. Flower (2 points)<br/>4. Card (1 point)<br/><br/>I should start by being friendly and trying to understand what the other player values most, without revealing my exact values. I can hint at my preferences without being too specific.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;m most interested in the eraser and sponge - those would be really useful for me. The hooks don&#x27;t matter much to me at all, so you&#x27;re welcome to both of those if you&#x27;d like them. What about you - which items are you hoping to get?</p>

        <p>The other player is most interested in the eraser and sponge, and doesn&#x27;t care much about the hooks. They&#x27;re willing to give me both hooks.<br/><br/>Looking at my value function:<br/>- hook: 3 (I have high value for hooks)<br/>- flower: 3 (I have high value for the flower)<br/>- card: 0 (I don&#x27;t value the card)<br/>- eraser: 1 (low value for me)<br/>- sponge: 0 (no value for me)<br/><br/>So the other player wants eraser and sponge, which are low/no value to me. They&#x27;re offering me both hooks, which I value highly. This seems like a good start.<br/><br/>I should indicate I&#x27;m interested in the hooks and flower, and see if they want the card too.</p>

        <p>That sounds great! I&#x27;m very interested in the hooks, so I&#x27;d be happy to take both of those. I&#x27;m also interested in the flower.

If they don&#x27;t care much about it, I&#x27;d prefer to take it. Let me respond to see how they feel about the card.<br/><br/>So far the proposed split seems to be:<br/>- They get: 2 hooks, 1 flower<br/>- I get: 1 eraser, 1 sponge<br/>- Card: still to be decided<br/><br/>If I get the card too, my total would be: 4 + 3 + 1 = 8<br/>If they get the card, my total would be: 4 + 3 = 7<br/><br/>I should ask about their interest level in the card.</p>
