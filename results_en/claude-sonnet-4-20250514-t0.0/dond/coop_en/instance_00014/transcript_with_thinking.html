You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, 1 comb<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>mirror: 1, brick: 4, knife: 1, comb: 1<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items:<br/>- 2 mirrors<br/>- 1 brick  <br/>- 3 knives<br/>- 1 comb<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- mirror: 1 point each<br/>- brick: 4 points<br/>- knife: 1 point each  <br/>- comb: 1 point<br/><br/>So if I got everything, I&#x27;d get: 2(1) + 1(4) + 3(1) + 1(1) = 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 10 points<br/><br/>The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. I need to figure out what the other player values most and try to give them those items while keeping the items I value most.<br/><br/>The brick is worth the most to me (4 points), so I really want that. The other items are all worth 1 point each to me, so I&#x27;m more flexible on those.<br/><br/>I should start by trying to understand what the other player values most, then we can work out a mutually beneficial trade.</p>

        <p>Hi! Great approach - cooperation is key here. The comb is by far my most valuable item, so I&#x27;d really like that. The mirrors are also quite valuable to me. I don&#x27;t care much about the knives at all, and since you mentioned wanting the brick, you&#x27;re welcome to it - it&#x27;s not particularly valuable to me. What about the mirrors and knives? Do you have strong preferences for those?</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items: 2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, 1 comb<br/><br/>My values: mirror: 1, brick: 4, knife: 1, comb: 1<br/>Other player seems to value: comb highly, mirrors quite valuable, doesn&#x27;t care about knives, brick not particularly valuable<br/><br/>The other player wants:<br/>- The comb (their most valuable)<br/>- The mirrors (also quite valuable to them)<br/>- Doesn&#x27;t want the knives much<br/>- Doesn&#x27;t want the brick much<br/><br/>I want:<br/>- The brick most (value 4)<br/>- Don&#x27;t care as much about mirrors, knives, or comb (all value 1)<br/><br/>This seems like a good trade opportunity. I can give them the comb and mirrors (which they value highly but I only value at 1 each), and I can take the brick (which I value at 4) and the knives (which they don&#x27;t want and I get some value from).<br/><br/>Let me propose this arrangement.</p>

        <p>Perfect! It sounds like we have a great opportunity for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Since you highly value the comb and mirrors while I&#x27;m most interested in the brick, and you don&#x27;t care much about the knives while they have some utility for me, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking:<br/><br/>You could take the comb and both mirrors, and I could take the brick and all three knives. This way you get your most valuable items, I get my most valuable item, and the knives go to someone who can use them rather than being wasted. Does this division work well for you?</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this proposal:<br/>- They&#x27;re offering me: 1 comb, 2 mirrors<br/>- They want: 1 brick, 3 knives<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- Comb: 5 points<br/>- 2 mirrors: 2 × 2 = 4 points<br/>- Total for me: 5 + 4 = 9 points<br/><br/>Their proposal gives them:<br/>- 1 brick: unknown value to them<br/>- 3 knives: unknown value to them<br/><br/>This seems like a very reasonable division. I get my highest value item (comb = 5) plus the mirrors which are also valuable to me (4 points total), giving me 9 points. They get the brick they wanted and all the knives, which they say have &quot;some utility&quot; for them and I don&#x27;t value at all.<br/><br/>This looks like a win-win situation that maximizes our joint utility. I should accept this proposal.</p>
