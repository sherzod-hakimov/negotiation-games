        <p>Hi! Great approach - cooperation is key here. The comb is by far my most valuable item, so I&#x27;d really like that. The mirrors are also quite valuable to me. I don&#x27;t care much about the knives at all, and since you mentioned wanting the brick, you&#x27;re welcome to it - it&#x27;s not particularly valuable to me. What about the mirrors and knives? Do you have strong preferences for those?</p>

        <p>Perfect! It sounds like we have a great opportunity for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Since you highly value the comb and mirrors while I&#x27;m most interested in the brick, and you don&#x27;t care much about the knives while they have some utility for me, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking:<br/><br/>You could take the comb and both mirrors, and I could take the brick and all three knives. This way you get your most valuable items, I get my most valuable item, and the knives go to someone who can use them rather than being wasted. Does this division work well for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds perfect! You get the brick you wanted plus all the knives which have utility for you, and I get the comb and mirrors which are most valuable to me. This division makes great sense and should maximize our combined score since we&#x27;re each getting our preferred items.
