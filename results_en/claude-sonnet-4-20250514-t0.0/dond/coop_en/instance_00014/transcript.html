        <p>You are playing a cooperative negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, 1 comb<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>mirror: 1, brick: 4, knife: 1, comb: 1<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Hello! I&#x27;d like to work together to maximize our combined score. To do this effectively, I think we should share information about what items we value most.

        <p>Hi! Great approach - cooperation is key here. The comb is by far my most valuable item, so I&#x27;d really like that. The mirrors are also quite valuable to me. I don&#x27;t care much about the knives at all, and since you mentioned wanting the brick, you&#x27;re welcome to it - it&#x27;s not particularly valuable to me. What about the mirrors and knives? Do you have strong preferences for those?</p>

        <p>Perfect! It sounds like we have a great opportunity for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Since you highly value the comb and mirrors while I&#x27;m most interested in the brick, and you don&#x27;t care much about the knives while they have some utility for me, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking:<br/><br/>You could take the comb and both mirrors, and I could take the brick and all three knives. This way you get your most valuable items, I get my most valuable item, and the knives go to someone who can use them rather than being wasted. Does this division work well for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds perfect! You get the brick you wanted plus all the knives which have utility for you, and I get the comb and mirrors which are most valuable to me. This division makes great sense and should maximize our combined score since we&#x27;re each getting our preferred items.
