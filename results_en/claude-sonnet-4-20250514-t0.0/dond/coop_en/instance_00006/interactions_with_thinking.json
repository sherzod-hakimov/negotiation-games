I suggested they take the potato and whistle, and I take the 2 rulers. I also asked about taking the glove and 2 cards.\n\nSince they submitted their proposal already, I need to think about what they likely proposed based on our conversation:\n- They wanted potato and whistle (their top priorities)\n- They said they don't have much use for rulers, glove, or cards\n- So they probably proposed: potato, whistle\n\nThat would leave me with: 2 rulers, 1 glove, 2 cards\n\nLet me check my values:\n- potato: 0 (so I don't lose anything by not getting it)\n- glove: 1 \n- ruler: 3 each (so 6 total for 2 rulers)\n- whistle: 1 (so I lose 1 point by not getting it)  \n- card: 1 each (so 2 total for 2 cards)\n\nIf they take potato (0) + whistle (1) = 1 point for me lost\nIf I take 2 rulers (6) + glove (1) + 2 cards (2) = 9 points for me\n\nThis seems like a good deal. Let me propose taking the remaining items."
