This way they get something they highly value, and I get something of equal value to me.\n\nFor the bags, we discussed me taking 2 and them taking 2, which seems fair.\n\nSo my proposal should be:\n- 1 carrot\n- 2 bags\n\nThis would leave them with:\n- 1 onion  \n- 2 bags\n\nThis seems to align with what we discussed and should maximize our combined utility."
