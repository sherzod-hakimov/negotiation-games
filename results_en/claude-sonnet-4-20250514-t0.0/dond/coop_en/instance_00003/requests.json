You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 carrot, 4 bags, 1 onion\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\ncarrot: 3, bag: 1, onion: 3\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

This way they get something they highly value, and I get something of equal value to me.\n\nFor the bags, we discussed me taking 2 and them taking 2, which seems fair.\n\nSo my proposal should be:\n- 1 carrot\n- 2 bags\n\nThis would leave them with:\n- 1 onion  \n- 2 bags\n\nThis seems to align with what we discussed and should maximize our combined utility.",
