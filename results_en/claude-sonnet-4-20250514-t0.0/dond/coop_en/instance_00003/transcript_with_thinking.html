        <p>I&#x27;m quite interested in the onion - it would be very valuable to me. The carrot isn&#x27;t something I need much, so you&#x27;re welcome to that if it&#x27;s useful to you.

        <p>The other player is quite interested in the onion and doesn&#x27;t need the carrot much, which they&#x27;re willing to give to me. They&#x27;re flexible on the bags.<br/><br/>Looking at my values:<br/>- carrot: 3 points<br/>- bag: 1 point each (4 bags = 4 points total)<br/>- onion: 3 points<br/><br/>The other player seems to highly value the onion and is willing to give me the carrot. Since they&#x27;re flexible on bags, I could potentially get the carrot (3 points) and some bags. If I let them have the onion (which they highly value) and some bags, this could work well for both of us.<br/><br/>Let me propose taking the carrot and maybe 2 bags, leaving them the onion and 2 bags. This way:<br/>- I get: carrot (3) + 2 bags (2) = 5 points<br/>- They get: onion (high value for them) + 2 bags<br/><br/>This seems like a good starting point for negotiation.</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great starting point! Since you&#x27;re very interested in the onion and I&#x27;d be happy to take the carrot, that seems like a natural fit. For the bags, how about if I take 2 bags and you take the other 2 bags along with the onion? That way we each get a fair share of the bags, you get the onion you really want, and I get the carrot. Does that division work for you?</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this proposal:<br/>- The human is suggesting: They get the carrot + 2 bags, I get the onion + 2 bags<br/>- My values: carrot = 0, bag = 1, onion = 6<br/>- So if I get the onion + 2 bags, my score would be: 6 + 2(1) = 8<br/>- If they get the carrot + 2 bags, and assuming they value the carrot positively and bags somewhat positively, this could work well for both of us<br/>- This seems like a reasonable and fair division that maximizes our joint value<br/><br/>Let me accept this proposal.</p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>That sounds perfect to me! You get the carrot and 2 bags, and I get the onion and 2 bags. This seems like a win-win arrangement since you&#x27;re getting the carrot and a fair share of bags, while I get the onion which is really valuable to me, plus some bags too. I&#x27;m ready to make this our final agreement.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 onion, 2 bags]</p>

        <p>Let me think about what the other player said and what would maximize our combined scores.<br/><br/>The other player said:<br/>- They&#x27;re &quot;quite interested in the onion&quot; - very valuable to them<br/>- The carrot &quot;isn&#x27;t something I need much&quot; - low value for them<br/>- They&#x27;d be &quot;happy with some&quot; bags but are &quot;flexible&quot;<br/><br/>Based on our conversation, it seems like:<br/>- They want the onion (high value for them)<br/>- They don&#x27;t want the carrot much (low value for them)  <br/>- They&#x27;re flexible on bags<br/><br/>My values are:<br/>- carrot: 3<br/>- bag: 1 each<br/>- onion: 3<br/><br/>So I value both the carrot and onion equally at 3 points each.<br/><br/>Given that they really want the onion and don&#x27;t care much about the carrot, and I value them equally, it makes sense for me to take the carrot and let them have the onion. This way they get something they highly value, and I get something of equal value to me.<br/><br/>For the bags, we discussed me taking 2 and them taking 2, which seems fair.<br/><br/>So my proposal should be:<br/>- 1 carrot<br/>- 2 bags<br/><br/>This would leave them with:<br/>- 1 onion  <br/>- 2 bags<br/><br/>This seems to align with what we discussed and should maximize our combined utility.</p>
