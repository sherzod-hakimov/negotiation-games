Based on our conversation, they valued rulers highly (their top priority), weren't interested in eggs at all, and valued the battery somewhat but less than rulers.\n\nI value:\n- ruler: 1 point each\n- egg: 2 points each  \n- battery: 3 points\n\nWe discussed that they would take all 3 rulers and I would take the 1 battery and 2 eggs. This would give me:\n- 1 battery = 3 points\n- 2 eggs = 4 points\n- Total = 7 points\n\nAnd they would get 3 rulers, which they said was their top priority.\n\nThis seems like the logical division we discussed, so I should propose taking the battery and eggs.",
