        <p>I need to be strategic here. My values are:<br/>- ruler: 3 points each<br/>- egg: 0 points each  <br/>- battery: 1 point<br/><br/>So I value rulers most highly (3 points each), then the battery (1 point), and eggs are worthless to me (0 points).<br/><br/>The other player is asking about my preferences. I should be somewhat honest to facilitate cooperation, but I also don&#x27;t want to reveal my exact values since that might allow them to extract more value. I should indicate that I value rulers highly and don&#x27;t care much about eggs, which should help us find a good division.<br/><br/>Since we want to maximize combined score, ideally the player who values each item type more should get those items.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;m glad you want to work together! I value rulers quite highly - they&#x27;re definitely my top priority. I&#x27;m not particularly interested in eggs at all, and the battery has some value to me but not as much as rulers. What about you - which items do you find most valuable? If we can figure out our different preferences, we should be able to find a division where we both get the items we care about most.</p>

        <p>The human says they value rulers highly (top priority), don&#x27;t care much about eggs, and battery has some value but less than rulers. <br/><br/>My values are: ruler: 1, egg: 2, battery: 3<br/><br/>So the human values rulers most, while I value the battery most (3 points), eggs second (2 points), and rulers least (1 point each).<br/><br/>This seems like a good complementary situation! I should express that I&#x27;m most interested in the battery and eggs, while being less interested in rulers. This way they can have most/all of the rulers, and I can focus on the battery and eggs.<br/><br/>Available items: 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery<br/><br/>A good division might be:<br/>- Human gets: 3 rulers (since they value them highly)<br/>- I get: 1 battery, 2 eggs (since I value battery=3 and eggs=2 each)<br/><br/>This would give me 3+2+2=7 points, and the human would get their preferred rulers.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>That&#x27;s perfect! Our preferences seem to complement each other well. I&#x27;m actually most interested in the battery - that&#x27;s my top priority. I also value the eggs quite a bit. Rulers are the least important to me.<br/><br/>So it sounds like you&#x27;d prefer the rulers, and I&#x27;d prefer the battery and eggs. Since there are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, and 1 battery, would you be happy taking all 3 rulers while I take the 1 battery and 2 eggs? That way we each get the items we value most!</p>

I get maximum value from the rulers (9 points), and they get the items they value most. Since I value eggs at 0 points, giving them the eggs costs me nothing, and I only give up 1 point from the battery but gain 9 points from getting all the rulers.<br/><br/>This appears to be an optimal solution where we each get the items we value most. I should accept this proposal.</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent arrangement! You&#x27;re absolutely right that our preferences complement each other perfectly. I&#x27;d be very happy to take all 3 rulers since those are what I value most, and it makes perfect sense for you to get the battery and eggs since those are your priorities.<br/><br/>This division gives us both exactly what we want most, so I think we&#x27;ve found the optimal solution. Shall we go ahead with this plan?<br/><br/>[Proposal: 3 rulers]</p>

        <p>The other player has submitted a secret proposal. Based on our conversation, they valued rulers highly (their top priority), weren&#x27;t interested in eggs at all, and valued the battery somewhat but less than rulers.<br/><br/>I value:<br/>- ruler: 1 point each<br/>- egg: 2 points each  <br/>- battery: 3 points<br/><br/>We discussed that they would take all 3 rulers and I would take the 1 battery and 2 eggs. This would give me:<br/>- 1 battery = 3 points<br/>- 2 eggs = 4 points<br/>- Total = 7 points<br/><br/>And they would get 3 rulers, which they said was their top priority.<br/><br/>This seems like the logical division we discussed, so I should propose taking the battery and eggs.</p>
