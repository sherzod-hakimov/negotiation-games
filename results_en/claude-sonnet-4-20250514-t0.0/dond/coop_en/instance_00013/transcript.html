Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

        <p>The flower is definitely my top priority - it&#x27;s quite valuable to me. The pen has some value too, but the frames are less important to me personally. What about you? Which items do you find most valuable? Understanding your preferences will help us find a division that works well for both of us.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s perfect! The flower isn&#x27;t particularly valuable to me, so I&#x27;m happy for you to have it since it&#x27;s your top priority. The pen is actually quite important to me, and I also have a good use for the frames. <br/><br/>So it sounds like you&#x27;d prefer the flower, and I&#x27;d prefer the pen and frames - does that division work well for you?

        <p>That sounds like an excellent arrangement! You getting the pen and all three frames while I get the flower works perfectly for me. The flower is by far my most valuable item, and it sounds like the pen and frames are much more useful to you than they would be to me.
