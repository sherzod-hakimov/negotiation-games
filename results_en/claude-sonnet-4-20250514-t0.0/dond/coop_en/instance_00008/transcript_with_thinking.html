        <p>You are playing a cooperative negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>scissors: 3, thimble: 0, fork: 1<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items:<br/>- 3 scissors<br/>- 1 thimble  <br/>- 1 fork<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- scissors: 3 points each<br/>- thimble: 0 points<br/>- fork: 1 point<br/><br/>So if I got all items, I&#x27;d get 3*3 + 1*0 + 1*1 = 10 points.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. To do this optimally, I need to understand what the other player values. I should try to give them items they value highly while keeping items I value highly.<br/><br/>Since I value scissors the most (3 points each) and the thimble not at all (0 points), I should try to keep the scissors and give away the thimble. The fork is worth 1 point to me, so it&#x27;s less critical.<br/><br/>Let me start by trying to understand what they value.</p>

        <p>I need to be strategic here. My values are:<br/>- scissors: 1 each (3 total, so 3 points max)<br/>- thimble: 6 (1 total, so 6 points max) <br/>- fork: 1 (1 total, so 1 point max)<br/><br/>The thimble is by far my most valuable item at 6 points. The scissors and fork are only worth 1 point each.<br/><br/>Since this is cooperative and we want to maximize the sum of both our scores, I should try to figure out what the other player values most. If they don&#x27;t value the thimble highly, then me getting it would be great for our combined score.<br/><br/>I should be somewhat honest about my preferences but not reveal exact values. I&#x27;ll indicate the thimble is important to me and see what they say about their preferences.</p>

        <p>The thimble is quite valuable to me, so I&#x27;d really like that if possible. The scissors and fork are less important to me. What about you - do any of these items stand out as particularly valuable? If we can figure out where our priorities differ, we should be able to find a good arrangement.</p>

        <p>The other player values the thimble highly, while I value it at 0. This is perfect - they can have the thimble without any cost to me. They say scissors and fork are less important to them, while I value scissors at 3 each (so 9 total for all 3) and fork at 1. <br/><br/>This seems like an easy win-win situation:<br/>- They get the thimble (high value for them, 0 value for me)<br/>- I get the 3 scissors and 1 fork (high value for me, lower value for them)<br/><br/>Let me propose this arrangement.</p>

        <p>That works out perfectly! The thimble isn&#x27;t valuable to me at all, so you should definitely take that. The scissors are quite important to me though, so I&#x27;d prefer to keep those. The fork is less critical for me. <br/><br/>How about this: you take the thimble, and I&#x27;ll take the 3 scissors and the fork? That way you get the item that&#x27;s most valuable to you, and I get the items that matter most to me. Does that sound fair?</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this proposal:<br/>- They want: 3 scissors, 1 fork<br/>- They&#x27;re offering me: 1 thimble<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- scissors: 1 each, so 3 scissors = 3 points<br/>- thimble: 6 points <br/>- fork: 1 point<br/><br/>If I accept their proposal:<br/>- My score: 1 thimble = 6 points<br/>- Their score: 3 scissors + 1 fork = 3 + 1 = 4 points<br/>- Total: 6 + 4 = 10 points<br/><br/>This seems like a good deal since I get the item I value most (thimble = 6 points) and they get the items they value most. The total score of 10 points seems reasonable given the constraints.<br/><br/>Let me accept this proposal.</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent arrangement! You&#x27;re right that this works out well for both of us - I get the thimble which is very valuable to me, and you get the scissors that are important to you plus the fork. This seems like a win-win solution.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 thimble]</p>
