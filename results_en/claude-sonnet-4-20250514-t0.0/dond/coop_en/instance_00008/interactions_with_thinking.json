They seemed to agree that I should take the scissors since they're important to me.\n\nMy values are:\n- scissors: 3 each (so 3 scissors = 9 points)\n- thimble: 0 points  \n- fork: 1 point\n\nIf I take all 3 scissors and the fork, I get 9 + 1 = 10 points.\nIf they take the thimble, and their values seem to make the thimble quite valuable to them, this could work well for both of us.\n\nThe other player suggested I take the 3 scissors and fork, and they take the thimble. That seems like a good arrangement based on our discussion.",
