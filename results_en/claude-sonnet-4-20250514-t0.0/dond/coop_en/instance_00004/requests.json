According to our agreement, I should propose to take all 4 stamps.\n\nMy secret value function is:\n- thimble: 2\n- soap: 0 \n- stamp: 2\n\nSo if I take 4 stamps, I get 4 × 2 = 8 points.\nIf the other player takes the soap and thimble, and their values are complementary to mine (they said soap has high value and thimble has some value), this should work out well for both of us.\n\nI need to format this as: [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]",
