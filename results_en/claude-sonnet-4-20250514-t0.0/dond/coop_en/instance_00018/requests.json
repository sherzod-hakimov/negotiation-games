Since you value potatoes most highly, it makes perfect sense for you to take both potatoes. And since you also prefer the coin over envelopes, how about you take the coin as well, and I'll take the 2 envelopes? This way you get your most preferred items, and I'm happy with the envelopes since they're all worth the same to me.\n\nDoes this division sound good to you?"
