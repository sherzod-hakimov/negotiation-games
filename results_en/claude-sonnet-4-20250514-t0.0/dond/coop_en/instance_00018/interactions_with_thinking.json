Based on our conversation, they said they value potatoes most highly, then the coin, then envelopes least. I suggested they take both potatoes and the coin, while I take the 2 envelopes.\n\nSince they value potatoes most and the coin second most, and I value all items equally (at 2 points each), the optimal division would indeed be for them to take the 2 potatoes and 1 coin, while I take the 2 envelopes.\n\nLet me check the math:\n- If they get 2 potatoes + 1 coin, and I get 2 envelopes\n- My score would be: 2 envelopes \u00d7 2 points = 4 points\n- This seems like a reasonable complementary proposal to what they likely submitted\n\nThe format should be: [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]",
