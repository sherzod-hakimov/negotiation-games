        <p>I value the potatoes most highly, followed by the coin, and then the envelopes are least valuable to me. What about you - which items do you find most valuable? If we have different preferences, we might be able to find a division that works well for both of us.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s great information! I actually value all the items roughly equally, so I&#x27;m quite flexible. Since you value potatoes most highly, it makes perfect sense for you to take both potatoes. And since you also prefer the coin over envelopes, how about you take the coin as well, and I&#x27;ll take the 2 envelopes? This way you get your most preferred items, and I&#x27;m happy with the envelopes since they&#x27;re all worth the same to me.<br/><br/>Does this division sound good to you?</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent division! You&#x27;re absolutely right - since I value potatoes most highly and you value everything roughly equally, this arrangement maximizes our combined benefit. I&#x27;m very happy with getting both potatoes and the coin, and you get both envelopes. This seems fair and efficient for both of us.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 2 potato, 1 coin]</p>
