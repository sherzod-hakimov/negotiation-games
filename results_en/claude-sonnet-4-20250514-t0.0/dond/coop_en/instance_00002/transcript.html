Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

        <p>Hi! I&#x27;m definitely interested in working together for the best total outcome. <br/><br/>I have a strong preference for the phone - it&#x27;s by far the most valuable item to me. I&#x27;m not particularly interested in the mirrors at all. The fruits have some value to me, but much less than the phone.<br/><br/>What about you? How do you rank the phone, mirrors, and fruits in terms of what you&#x27;d prefer to get?</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing! I actually have quite different preferences, which could work well for us.<br/><br/>The phone is valuable to me too, but I&#x27;m really interested in the mirrors - they&#x27;re quite valuable in my view. The fruits are my lowest priority.<br/><br/>Since you strongly prefer the phone and aren&#x27;t interested in mirrors, while I&#x27;m very interested in mirrors, maybe we could work out a deal where you get the phone and I get the mirrors? Then we&#x27;d need to figure out how to split the 2 fruits between us.<br/><br/>What do you think about that basic framework?</p>

        <p>That sounds like an excellent framework! I really appreciate that you&#x27;re thinking about how our different preferences can create a win-win situation.<br/><br/>You&#x27;re absolutely right - since you&#x27;re very interested in the mirrors and I don&#x27;t value them at all, you taking both mirrors makes perfect sense. And since the phone is my top priority, me getting that works great too.<br/><br/>For the 2 fruits, since you mentioned they&#x27;re your lowest priority, would you be okay if I took both of them? That way you get the items you value most (the mirrors) and I get the items I value most (phone + fruits). <br/><br/>Or if you&#x27;d prefer, we could each take 1 fruit. What would work better for you?</p>

        <p>That sounds perfect! Since the mirrors are very valuable to me and worthless to you, and the phone is your top priority, this creates a great win-win situation.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m totally fine with you taking both fruits along with the phone. That way you get everything you value most, and I get the items that are most valuable to me. This seems like it maximizes our total benefit.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 2 mirror]</p>
