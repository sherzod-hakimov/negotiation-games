They said the bucket has some value but less than the mirror, and books aren't particularly valuable to them.\n\nMy values are: bucket: 4, book: 1, mirror: 1\n\nSo I value bucket most, then books, then mirror least.\n\nThe other player seems to have submitted their secret proposal already. Based on our conversation, they would likely want the mirror (their top priority) and possibly the bucket. Since they said books aren't valuable to them, they probably didn't ask for many books.\n\nTo maximize our joint score, I should propose something that complements what they likely proposed. Given their stated preferences, they probably proposed something like:\n- 1 mirror (their top priority)\n- Maybe the bucket too\n- Probably few or no books\n\nSo I should propose items that don't conflict with this. Since I value the bucket highly (4 points) and books moderately (1 point each), and the mirror least (1 point), I should try to get:\n- The bucket if possible (but they might have claimed it)\n- The books (which they don't value much)\n\nGiven that they probably claimed the mirror and possibly the bucket, I should propose the books and see if I can get the bucket too. But if they claimed the bucket, I should focus on the books.\n\nLet me propose: bucket and all 5 books. This gives me 4 + 5 = 9 points. If they proposed just the mirror, this would be complementary and they'd get their top priority while I get good value too.",
