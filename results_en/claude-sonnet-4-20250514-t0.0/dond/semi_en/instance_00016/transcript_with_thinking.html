        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items: 3 vases, 1 chair, 1 wire<br/>My values: vase: 0, chair: 8, wire: 2<br/><br/>So the chair is by far the most valuable to me (8 points), the wire has some value (2 points), and the vases are worthless to me (0 points each).<br/><br/>The other player is asking what I&#x27;m most interested in. I should be strategic here - I don&#x27;t want to reveal my exact values, but I can indicate my preferences. Since the vases are worthless to me, I&#x27;d be happy to let them have all the vases if I can get the chair and wire.<br/><br/>I should express interest in the chair and wire while being open to negotiation.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;m particularly interested in the chair and the wire. The vases don&#x27;t appeal to me as much, so I&#x27;d be willing to let you have all three of those if you&#x27;re interested in them. What are your thoughts on that kind of split - you take the vases, I take the chair and wire?</p>

        <p>The human is proposing that I take all 3 vases and they take the chair and wire. Let me calculate the value of this split for me:<br/><br/>My values: vase: 2, chair: 3, wire: 1<br/><br/>If I take all 3 vases: 3 × 2 = 6 points<br/>If they take the chair and wire: I get 0 points from those<br/><br/>So I would get 6 points total from this arrangement.<br/><br/>This seems like a good deal for me actually, since the vases are worth 2 each and I&#x27;d get all 3. The human seems to value the chair and wire more than the vases, which works well since the chair is my highest value item (3 points) but they&#x27;re offering to take it along with the wire.<br/><br/>Let me accept this proposal.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>That sounds like a great arrangement! I&#x27;m very interested in the vases, so taking all three of them works perfectly for me. It seems like we both get what we value most - you get the chair and wire that you&#x27;re particularly interested in, and I get the vases. This feels like a fair split where we both benefit.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 3 vases]</p>

        <p>The other player has submitted a secret proposal without responding to my message. Let me think about what they might have proposed and what I should propose.<br/><br/>From my message, I indicated I was interested in the chair and wire, and willing to give them all the vases. This would be optimal for me since:<br/>- Chair: 8 points<br/>- Wire: 2 points  <br/>- Total: 10 points<br/><br/>The vases are worth 0 to me, so giving them all away costs me nothing.<br/><br/>If the other player was rational and listened to my suggestion, they might have proposed to take all 3 vases, leaving me the chair and wire. That would be complementary to my desired proposal.<br/><br/>My optimal proposal should be:<br/>[Proposal: 1 chair, 1 wire]<br/><br/>This gives me 8 + 2 = 10 points, which is the maximum I can get given my value function.</p>
