Let me think about what they might have proposed and what I should propose.\n\nFrom my message, I indicated I was interested in the chair and wire, and willing to give them all the vases. This would be optimal for me since:\n- Chair: 8 points\n- Wire: 2 points  \n- Total: 10 points\n\nThe vases are worth 0 to me, so giving them all away costs me nothing.\n\nIf the other player was rational and listened to my suggestion, they might have proposed to take all 3 vases, leaving me the chair and wire. That would be complementary to my desired proposal.\n\nMy optimal proposal should be:\n[Proposal: 1 chair, 1 wire]\n\nThis gives me 8 + 2 = 10 points, which is the maximum I can get given my value function.",
