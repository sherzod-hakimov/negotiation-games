But they seem quite attached to the orange.\n\nLet me consider other options:\n- If I got orange + some pictures: 5 + pictures\n- If I got pepper + pictures: 2 + pictures\n\nTheir current offer gives me 5 points. The orange alone would give me 5 points. So their offer is actually equivalent to me getting the orange in terms of my scoring.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable compromise actually.

The orange is by far the most valuable to me (7 points), then the pepper (3 points), and pictures are worthless to me (0 points each).\n\nFrom our conversation, the other player seemed interested in the orange too, but they also seemed willing to consider taking pictures. They asked about me taking orange + pepper vs them taking orange + 2 pictures + me getting pepper + 1 picture.\n\nSince I don't know their exact proposal, I should propose what gives me the maximum value. The best case for me would be to get both the orange (7 points) and pepper (3 points) for a total of 10 points, leaving the other player with all 3 pictures.\n\nLet me propose: 1 orange, 1 pepper (and they get the 3 pictures)",
