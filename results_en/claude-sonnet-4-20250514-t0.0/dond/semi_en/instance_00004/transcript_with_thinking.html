Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I should try to figure out what they value most while revealing as little as possible about my own preferences.<br/><br/>The orange is worth the most to me (5 points), so I really want that. The pepper is worth 2 points, and each picture is only worth 1 point.<br/><br/>I should start by trying to understand what the other player values, maybe by making a general opening statement about the negotiation.</p>

        <p>The human is proposing that they get the orange and pepper, while I get all 3 pictures.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the values:<br/>- If I accept their proposal:<br/>  - They get: orange (5 points for them, but I don&#x27;t know their values) + pepper (2 points for them)<br/>  - I get: 3 pictures = 3 × 1 = 3 points for me<br/><br/>- My item values are: orange: 5, pepper: 2, picture: 1<br/>- So if I accepted their proposal, I&#x27;d get 3 points total.<br/><br/>But the orange alone is worth 5 points to me, which is more than all 3 pictures combined. This seems like a bad deal for me.<br/><br/>I should try to negotiate for the orange since it&#x27;s my most valuable item. I could offer them the pepper and some pictures, or try to understand what they value most.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s an interesting offer, but I&#x27;m actually quite interested in the orange myself. Since you mentioned the pictures aren&#x27;t very valuable to you, how about this alternative: I take the orange and 2 pictures, and you get the pepper and 1 picture? Or if you really prefer both the orange and pepper, what would you be willing to offer in addition to the pictures to make it worth my while?</p>

        <p>Let me think about this situation:<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- Orange: 7 points<br/>- Pepper: 3 points  <br/>- Picture: 0 points each<br/><br/>The human is interested in the orange too, which is my most valuable item. They&#x27;re proposing:<br/>1. Option 1: They get orange + 2 pictures, I get pepper + 1 picture<br/>   - My score would be: 3 (pepper) + 0 (picture) = 3 points<br/>   - This is much worse than my ideal of getting orange + pepper = 10 points<br/><br/>2. Option 2: They&#x27;re asking what I&#x27;d offer in addition to pictures if I want both orange and pepper<br/><br/>Since I value pictures at 0, I can&#x27;t really offer &quot;more&quot; beyond the pictures. The orange is worth 7 to me and pepper is worth 3, so together they&#x27;re worth 10 points. If I only get the pepper + 1 picture, that&#x27;s only 3 points.<br/><br/>I should try to negotiate for at least the orange, since that&#x27;s my most valuable item. Maybe I can propose keeping the orange and giving them the pepper + all 3 pictures.</p>

        <p>I understand you&#x27;re interested in the orange too. Since the pictures have no value to me, I can&#x27;t really offer anything &quot;in addition&quot; to them - they&#x27;re already everything I can give beyond the orange and pepper.<br/><br/>How about this compromise: I keep the orange, and you get the pepper plus all 3 pictures? That way you get 4 items total while I only get 1. Does that seem like a fair trade to you?</p>

        <p>Let me think about this carefully. <br/><br/>The human is offering:<br/>- They get: 1 orange<br/>- I get: 1 pepper + 3 pictures<br/><br/>My values are:<br/>- Orange: 5<br/>- Pepper: 2  <br/>- Picture: 1 each<br/><br/>So if I accept their offer:<br/>- They get: 1 orange = 5 points (from their perspective, though I don&#x27;t know their exact values)<br/>- I get: 1 pepper + 3 pictures = 2 + 3(1) = 5 points<br/><br/>This would give me 5 points total.<br/><br/>If I could get the orange instead, that alone would be worth 5 points to me, same as their current offer. But they seem quite attached to the orange.<br/><br/>Let me consider other options:<br/>- If I got orange + some pictures: 5 + pictures<br/>- If I got pepper + pictures: 2 + pictures<br/><br/>Their current offer gives me 5 points. The orange alone would give me 5 points. So their offer is actually equivalent to me getting the orange in terms of my scoring.<br/><br/>This seems like a reasonable compromise actually. I get the same value (5 points) as I would from just the orange, and they get what they really want.</p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>You make a good point about the quantity - 4 items versus 1 does seem unbalanced in terms of number. I appreciate that you&#x27;re being reasonable about this. Your compromise of you getting the orange and me getting the pepper plus all 3 pictures actually works well for me. That seems like a fair trade given our different interests.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 pepper, 3 pictures]</p>

        <p>The other player has submitted their secret proposal already. I need to submit mine now.<br/><br/>Let me think about what would be optimal for me:<br/>- Orange: value 7<br/>- Pepper: value 3  <br/>- Picture: value 0<br/><br/>So I want to maximize my score. The orange is by far the most valuable to me (7 points), then the pepper (3 points), and pictures are worthless to me (0 points each).<br/><br/>From our conversation, the other player seemed interested in the orange too, but they also seemed willing to consider taking pictures. They asked about me taking orange + pepper vs them taking orange + 2 pictures + me getting pepper + 1 picture.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their exact proposal, I should propose what gives me the maximum value. The best case for me would be to get both the orange (7 points) and pepper (3 points) for a total of 10 points, leaving the other player with all 3 pictures.<br/><br/>Let me propose: 1 orange, 1 pepper (and they get the 3 pictures)</p>
