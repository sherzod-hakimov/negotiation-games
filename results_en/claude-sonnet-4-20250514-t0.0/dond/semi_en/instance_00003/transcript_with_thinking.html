        <p>Let me analyze this negotiation game:<br/><br/>Available items: 1 hat, 3 pens, 1 sponge<br/>My values: hat = 4, pen = 2, sponge = 0<br/><br/>So the maximum score I could get is: 1×4 + 3×2 + 1×0 = 4 + 6 + 0 = 10 points<br/><br/>I need to negotiate with the other player to divide these items. The key is that our proposals must be complementary - meaning together we don&#x27;t ask for more items than are available.<br/><br/>I should start by making an opening offer or asking about their preferences. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I should try to figure out what they value most. The hat is worth the most to me (4 points), so I&#x27;d really like to get that. The pens are worth 2 each, so getting all 3 would give me 6 points. The sponge is worthless to me.<br/><br/>Let me start with a friendly opening to gauge their interests.</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Items available:<br/>- 1 hat<br/>- 3 pens  <br/>- 1 sponge<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- hat: 4 points<br/>- pen: 0 points each<br/>- sponge: 6 points<br/><br/>So the sponge is most valuable to me (6 points), followed by the hat (4 points). The pens are worthless to me (0 points each).<br/><br/>The other player is asking what I&#x27;m most interested in. I should be strategic here - I don&#x27;t want to reveal my exact values, but I can indicate my preferences. Since the pens are worthless to me, I&#x27;d be happy to let them have all the pens if I can get the sponge and ideally the hat too.<br/><br/>I should express interest in the sponge and hat, and suggest they can have the pens.</p>

        <p>Let me think about this offer. The other player wants the sponge and hat, and is offering me all 3 pens.<br/><br/>My values are:<br/>- hat: 4 points<br/>- pen: 2 points each (so 3 pens = 6 points)<br/>- sponge: 0 points<br/><br/>If I accept their proposal:<br/>- I get: 3 pens = 3 × 2 = 6 points<br/>- They get: 1 hat + 1 sponge = they value these items (unknown to me)<br/><br/>If I wanted everything for myself:<br/>- 1 hat + 3 pens + 1 sponge = 4 + 6 + 0 = 10 points<br/><br/>So their offer gives me 6 out of 10 possible points, which is 60% of the total value I could get. That seems reasonable, especially since they seem to really want the hat and sponge, and the sponge has no value to me anyway.<br/><br/>The hat is worth 4 points to me, which is significant, but getting all 3 pens gives me 6 points, which is actually more. This seems like it could be a good deal.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>That sounds like a reasonable arrangement! I&#x27;m quite happy to take the 3 pens, and it sounds like the sponge and hat would be more valuable to you. So just to confirm - you would get the hat and sponge, and I would get all 3 pens. Does that work for you?</p>

        <p>The other player is agreeing to give me the hat and sponge in exchange for the 3 pens. Let me check the values:<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- hat: 4 points<br/>- sponge: 6 points<br/>- pen: 0 points each<br/><br/>So if I get the hat and sponge, I would get 4 + 6 = 10 points total.<br/>If they get all 3 pens, they get whatever value they place on pens.<br/><br/>This seems like a great deal for me since I value the hat and sponge highly and don&#x27;t value pens at all. The other player seems happy with the pens, so this appears to be a mutually beneficial arrangement.<br/><br/>I should confirm this agreement and make my secret proposal.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>Perfect! Yes, that arrangement works great for me. You get the 3 pens, and I get the hat and sponge. I&#x27;m happy with this split.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 hat, 1 sponge]</p>

        <p>The other player said they&#x27;re particularly interested in the sponge and hat, and offered me all 3 pens. They said the pens aren&#x27;t useful for them. I confirmed this arrangement and they seemed to agree.<br/><br/>Looking at my value function:<br/>- hat: 4 points<br/>- pen: 2 points each (so 3 pens = 6 points total)<br/>- sponge: 0 points<br/><br/>If I take all 3 pens, I get 6 points.<br/>If they take the hat (4 points for me lost) and sponge (0 points for me), that&#x27;s fine.<br/><br/>So the deal they proposed is:<br/>- They get: hat, sponge<br/>- I get: 3 pens<br/><br/>This gives me 6 points, which is better than the hat alone (4 points). Since they&#x27;ve already submitted their proposal, I should submit mine to match what we discussed.</p>
