I confirmed this arrangement and they seemed to agree.\n\nLooking at my value function:\n- hat: 4 points\n- pen: 2 points each (so 3 pens = 6 points total)\n- sponge: 0 points\n\nIf I take all 3 pens, I get 6 points.\nIf they take the hat (4 points for me lost) and sponge (0 points for me), that's fine.\n\nSo the deal they proposed is:\n- They get: hat, sponge\n- I get: 3 pens\n\nThis gives me 6 points, which is better than the hat alone (4 points). Since they've already submitted their proposal, I should submit mine to match what we discussed.",
