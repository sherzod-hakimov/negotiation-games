The other player seems happy with getting the glue (which they said was really important) and the battery.\n\nLet me make sure the proposals would be complementary:\n- My proposal: 1 ball, 2 dice\n- Their proposal would be: 1 glue, 1 battery\n\nAvailable items: 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, 1 battery\nThis adds up perfectly - all items would be distributed and there's no overlap.\n\nThis seems like a win-win deal, so I should finalize it."
