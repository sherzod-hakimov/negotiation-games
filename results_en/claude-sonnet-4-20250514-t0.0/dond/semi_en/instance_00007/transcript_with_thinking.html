        <p>The other player is interested in glasses and needles, and says cups aren&#x27;t something they need much. They didn&#x27;t mention wires.<br/><br/>Looking at my values:<br/>- wire: 1 point each (2 wires = 2 points total)<br/>- glass: 0 points each <br/>- needle: 0 points each<br/>- cup: 4 points each (2 cups = 8 points total)<br/><br/>So I really want the cups (8 points total) and the wires would be nice (2 points total). I don&#x27;t care about glasses or needles.<br/><br/>This seems like it could work out well - they want glasses and needles (which I don&#x27;t value), and they don&#x27;t need cups much (which I value highly). I should propose taking the cups and see if they&#x27;d be willing to give me those in exchange for the glasses and needles.</p>

        <p>That sounds like it could work out perfectly! I&#x27;m really hoping to get the cups - those would be very valuable to me. The wires would also be useful. Since you&#x27;re interested in the glasses and needles and don&#x27;t need the cups much, maybe we could arrange it so you get both glasses and both needles, and I get both cups?

        <p>The human is offering me both cups and both wires, while they take both glasses and both needles. Let me check this against my value function:<br/><br/>My values: wire: 1, glass: 0, needle: 0, cup: 4<br/><br/>If I get both cups and both wires:<br/>- 2 cups × 4 = 8 points<br/>- 2 wires × 1 = 2 points<br/>- Total: 10 points<br/><br/>If they get both glasses and both needles:<br/>- I don&#x27;t care about glasses (value 0) or needles (value 0)<br/><br/>This is an excellent deal for me! I get maximum value from the cups (which are worth 4 each to me) and I also get the wires (worth 1 each). Since I don&#x27;t value glasses or needles at all, giving those to them costs me nothing.<br/><br/>This seems like a win-win situation and I should accept this deal.</p>
