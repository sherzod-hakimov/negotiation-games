        <p>Hi! I&#x27;m particularly interested in the glasses and needles - those would be quite useful for me. The cups aren&#x27;t really something I need much. What about you - which items are you hoping to get? Maybe we can find a trade that gives us both what we value most.</p>

        <p>That sounds like it could work out perfectly! I&#x27;m really hoping to get the cups - those would be very valuable to me. The wires would also be useful. Since you&#x27;re interested in the glasses and needles and don&#x27;t need the cups much, maybe we could arrange it so you get both glasses and both needles, and I get both cups? What do you think about the wires - are you interested in those at all?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great arrangement! I&#x27;m not particularly interested in the wires - they&#x27;re not that valuable to me. So if you&#x27;d like both wires along with both cups, that works perfectly for me.
