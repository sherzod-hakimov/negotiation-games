	 That's interesting! I'm actually quite drawn to the thimbles - they seem like they could be really useful for my purposes. Since you mentioned being interested in the rope and lamp, what if you took those two items and I focused on the thimbles? That way we'd each get items that align well with our preferences. Does that sound like a reasonable split to you?
