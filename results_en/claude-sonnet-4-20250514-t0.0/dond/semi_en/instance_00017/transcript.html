        <p>That&#x27;s great to hear! I&#x27;m most interested in the candies - they seem very valuable to me. I&#x27;m not particularly interested in the plates or lemons, so it sounds like we might have some good opportunities to trade. <br/><br/>Since you mentioned wanting the coin and lemons, and I&#x27;m not interested in lemons at all, you could definitely have both lemons. The candies are my top priority. What do you think about the coin though - would you be willing to discuss how we might handle that since it seems we both find it appealing?</p>

        <p>That sounds like a great starting point! Since you&#x27;re not interested in lemons and I am, and I&#x27;m not interested in candies while you are, those seem like natural fits.<br/><br/>For the coin, I do find it quite valuable, but I&#x27;m open to discussing a trade. Since you mentioned not being particularly interested in plates, what if I took the coin and you took something else to balance things out? For instance, I could take the coin and both lemons, while you get both candies. That would leave the 2 plates - we could split those one each, or if you really don&#x27;t want them, I could take both plates as well.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on that arrangement?</p>

        <p>That arrangement sounds excellent to me! You&#x27;re absolutely right that this plays to our different interests perfectly. I&#x27;m very happy to let you have the coin and both lemons since those don&#x27;t have much value to me, and getting both candies would be wonderful.<br/><br/>As for the plates, since they don&#x27;t matter to me at all, you&#x27;re welcome to take both plates as well if you&#x27;d like them. So my understanding is:<br/><br/>- You would get: 1 coin, 2 lemons, 2 plates<br/>- I would get: 2 candies<br/><br/>Does that sound like a fair deal to you? I think this arrangement really maximizes value for both of us based on what we&#x27;ve each expressed interest in.</p>
