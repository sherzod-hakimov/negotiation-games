Since you're not interested in lemons and I am, and I'm not interested in candies while you are, those seem like natural fits.\n\nFor the coin, I do find it quite valuable, but I'm open to discussing a trade. Since you mentioned not being particularly interested in plates, what if I took the coin and you took something else to balance things out? For instance, I could take the coin and both lemons, while you get both candies. That would leave the 2 plates - we could split those one each, or if you really don't want them, I could take both plates as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that arrangement?",
