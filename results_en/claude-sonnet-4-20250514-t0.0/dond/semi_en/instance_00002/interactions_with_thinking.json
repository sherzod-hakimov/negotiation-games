Your proposal of you taking the shovel and 3 glasses while I get the 2 berries and bowl actually works well for me. The bowl is quite useful to me and the berries are a nice bonus. Since you value the shovel highly and I'm getting good value from the bowl, this seems like a fair split. Shall we go with that arrangement?",
