They seemed open to me taking the bolts when I suggested they take chalk and crayons while I take the 2 bolts.\n\nSince they've already submitted their secret proposal, I should submit mine. Based on our conversation, it sounds like they might be proposing to take the chalk and crayons, leaving me the bolts. That would be ideal for me since the bolts are the only items I value.\n\nI should propose to take the 2 bolts.",
