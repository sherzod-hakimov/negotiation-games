The toy and boxes are worth 0 to me.\n\nIf I can only get the stick, that's still 7 points, which is pretty good.\n\nGiven that the other player has submitted their proposal already, I need to think about what they might have proposed based on our conversation. They seemed open to me getting the stick and them getting the other items, but they also really wanted the stick initially.\n\nI should propose what gives me the most value. The stick (7) + towel (3) = 10 points would be ideal, but they seemed to want at least one valuable item too.\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically.
