        <p>Hi! I&#x27;m particularly interested in the soap and the egg. The apples aren&#x27;t really useful for me, so I&#x27;d be happy to let you have all of those if you&#x27;re interested in them. What do you think about that kind of split - you take the apples and I take the soap and egg?</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s interesting that you&#x27;re not interested in the apples! However, I do find the soap and egg quite useful as well. Since you mentioned you really want both the soap and egg, would you consider a trade where I keep one of those items? For example, what if I took all 3 apples plus either the soap or the egg, and you took the remaining item? Which of the soap or egg would you prefer if we went with that arrangement?</p>

        <p>I really appreciate you being flexible! If I had to choose between the soap and egg, I&#x27;d definitely prefer the soap. But before we settle on that, let me ask - do the apples have good value for you? Since they&#x27;re completely useless to me, I&#x27;m wondering if we could find an arrangement where you get all the apples and I get both the soap and egg. That way you&#x27;d get 3 items that work for you, and I&#x27;d get the 2 items that work for me. Does that seem reasonable?</p>

        <p>I appreciate the offer, but I have to be honest - while the apples do have some value to me, the soap and egg are actually quite valuable to me as well. Since you mentioned you&#x27;d prefer the soap if you had to choose, how about this compromise: you take the soap and all the items that are useless to you (which you said were the apples, though I&#x27;d like to keep those), and I take the egg? Actually, let me rephrase that - what if you take the soap and I take the 3 apples plus the egg? That way you get your preferred item and I get the apples you don&#x27;t want plus one other item.</p>

        <p>That sounds like a fair compromise to me! You&#x27;re right that the apples don&#x27;t have any value for me, so it makes sense for you to take those.
