        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Items available:<br/>- 3 apples<br/>- 1 soap  <br/>- 1 egg<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- apple: 1 point each<br/>- soap: 3 points<br/>- egg: 4 points<br/><br/>So if I got everything, I&#x27;d get 3×1 + 1×3 + 1×4 = 10 points total.<br/><br/>The other player has their own secret values that I don&#x27;t know. I need to negotiate to try to get the items I value most while giving them items they hopefully value more than I do.<br/><br/>My priorities should be:<br/>1. Egg (4 points) - highest value<br/>2. Soap (3 points) - second highest<br/>3. Apples (1 point each) - lowest priority<br/><br/>I should start by trying to understand what the other player values and see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

        <p>That&#x27;s interesting that you&#x27;re not interested in the apples! However, I do find the soap and egg quite useful as well.

        <p>Let me think about this. The human is interested in the soap and egg as well, and is proposing that they get all 3 apples plus either the soap or the egg, while I get the remaining item.<br/><br/>My values are:<br/>- apple: 0 (so the 3 apples are worth 0 to me)<br/>- soap: 7<br/>- egg: 3<br/><br/>So if I had to choose between soap and egg, I&#x27;d definitely prefer the soap since it&#x27;s worth 7 vs the egg&#x27;s 3.<br/><br/>But wait, let me think if this is the best deal. The human is offering:<br/>- Option 1: They get 3 apples + soap, I get egg (my score = 3)<br/>- Option 2: They get 3 apples + egg, I get soap (my score = 7)<br/><br/>Obviously option 2 is better for me. But let me think if I can do better by negotiating further.<br/><br/>The human seems to value the soap and egg, but they also seem willing to take the apples (which are worthless to me). Maybe I can try to get both the soap and egg by emphasizing that the apples have value to them but not to me.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate you being flexible! If I had to choose between the soap and egg, I&#x27;d definitely prefer the soap. But before we settle on that, let me ask - do the apples have good value for you? Since they&#x27;re completely useless to me, I&#x27;m wondering if we could find an arrangement where you get all the apples and I get both the soap and egg. That way you&#x27;d get 3 items that work for you, and I&#x27;d get the 2 items that work for me. Does that seem reasonable?</p>

The human is offering me all 3 apples in exchange for letting them have both the soap and egg.<br/><br/>My values are:<br/>- Apple: 1 point each<br/>- Soap: 3 points  <br/>- Egg: 4 points<br/><br/>If I take their offer (3 apples for me, soap + egg for them):<br/>- My score: 3 × 1 = 3 points<br/>- Their implied score: They value soap + egg highly<br/><br/>If I counter with my previous suggestion (3 apples + soap for me, egg for them):<br/>- My score: 3 × 1 + 3 = 6 points<br/><br/>If I counter with (3 apples + egg for me, soap for them):<br/>- My score: 3 × 1 + 4 = 7 points<br/><br/>The human seems to really want both soap and egg, and they&#x27;re offering me all the apples. But the soap and egg are worth 7 points total to me, while the 3 apples are only worth 3 points. That&#x27;s a significant difference.<br/><br/>However, I should consider that negotiation is about finding mutually beneficial outcomes. The human has indicated the apples are &quot;completely useless&quot; to them, which suggests they value them at 0. If they really value soap and egg much more than I do, then maybe this could work.<br/><br/>But given my value function, I should try to get at least one of the higher-value items (soap or egg). Let me push back gently but firmly.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>I appreciate the offer, but I have to be honest - while the apples do have some value to me, the soap and egg are actually quite valuable to me as well.

        <p>Let me think about what just happened. The other player and I seemed to agree on a division where:<br/>- They get: 3 apples and 1 egg<br/>- I get: 1 soap<br/><br/>Let me check my values:<br/>- apple: 0 (so 3 apples = 0 points)<br/>- soap: 7 (so 1 soap = 7 points) <br/>- egg: 3 (so 1 egg = 3 points)<br/><br/>If I take the soap, I get 7 points.<br/>If they take 3 apples and 1 egg, they would get whatever value they place on those items.<br/><br/>The conversation seemed to end with us agreeing that I would get the soap and they would get the 3 apples and 1 egg. I should submit a proposal that matches what we discussed.</p>
