	 That's interesting that the frame appeals to you! I do find the hammers quite useful actually - having multiple hammers could be really handy. The frame does have some appeal to me as well though. Since you're not interested in the hammers, would you consider a deal where I take all 3 hammers and you get the frame and shoe? That way you'd get the frame you want most, plus the shoe, and I'd get the hammers that seem more useful to me than to you.
