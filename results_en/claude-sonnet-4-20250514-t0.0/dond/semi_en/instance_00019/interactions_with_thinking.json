I get 10 points total, and they get the items they value most. The picture alone is worth 7 points to me, which is my most valuable item. The 3 bolts give me another 3 points. \n\nSince threads are worth 0 to me, I'm giving up nothing of value while getting both the picture (my highest value item) and all the bolts.
