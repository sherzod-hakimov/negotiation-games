They asked about magnets and whether any appeal to me. I said the flower is what I want most and magnets don't appeal to me, and suggested they take the shovel and all magnets while I take the flower.\n\nNow they've submitted a secret proposal. I need to submit mine.\n\nSince I value the flower at 8 points and the shovel at 2 points, and magnets at 0 points, my best outcome would be to get the flower (8 points) and possibly the shovel (2 points) for a total of 10 points. But given that the other player expressed strong interest in the shovel, they likely want that.\n\nThe safest proposal that gives me the most value while likely being complementary to theirs would be to ask for just the flower, since that's what I value most (8 points) and in our conversation I indicated that's what I want most. They seemed interested in the shovel and magnets.\n\nSo my proposal should be: the flower only.",
