        <p>Let me analyze this situation:<br/><br/>Available items:<br/>- 4 magnets<br/>- 1 shovel  <br/>- 1 flower<br/><br/>My values:<br/>- magnet: 0 (I don&#x27;t value magnets at all)<br/>- shovel: 2 <br/>- flower: 8 (this is my most valuable item)<br/><br/>So ideally I want the flower (worth 8 points) and the shovel (worth 2 points) for a total of 10 points. The magnets are worthless to me.<br/><br/>Since the other player doesn&#x27;t know my values, I should try to figure out what they value. I should start by exploring what they&#x27;re interested in without revealing too much about my own preferences initially.<br/><br/>I should not reveal my exact values, but I can hint at my preferences.

        <p>The other player is interested in the shovel and the flower. Let me analyze my values:<br/>- magnet: 0 (I don&#x27;t value these at all)<br/>- shovel: 2 (some value, but not huge)<br/>- flower: 8 (this is my highest value item!)<br/><br/>The other player wants the shovel and is &quot;somewhat interested&quot; in the flower. But the flower is worth 8 points to me, which is by far my most valuable item. The shovel is only worth 2 points to me.<br/><br/>I should try to get the flower, which is my most valuable item. I can let them have the shovel since it&#x27;s only worth 2 points to me, and I can offer them the magnets too since those are worth 0 to me.<br/><br/>I need to be strategic here - I shouldn&#x27;t reveal my exact values, but I should try to steer toward getting the flower.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s interesting! I&#x27;m actually most drawn to the flower - I think it would be perfect for what I have in mind. The magnets don&#x27;t really appeal to me much, so you&#x27;re welcome to those if they work for you. Since you mentioned wanting the shovel, how about this: what if you take the shovel and all the magnets, and I take the flower? Does that sound fair to you?</p>

        <p>Let me analyze this offer:<br/>- They want: 1 flower<br/>- They&#x27;re offering me: 1 shovel + 4 magnets<br/><br/>My values are:<br/>- magnet: 1 each (so 4 magnets = 4 points)<br/>- shovel: 4 points  <br/>- flower: 2 points<br/><br/>If I accept their offer, I would get:<br/>- 1 shovel (4 points) + 4 magnets (4 points) = 8 points total<br/><br/>If they get the flower, they get whatever value they place on it.<br/><br/>This seems like a great deal for me! I get 8 points total, which is actually more than the maximum possible (4+4+2=10 for all items), so getting 8 out of 10 possible points is excellent. The shovel is my highest-value item, and getting all the magnets as a bonus is great.<br/><br/>I should accept this offer.</p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>That sounds like an excellent arrangement! I&#x27;m very happy with getting the shovel since that&#x27;s really what I was hoping for most, and the magnets work well for me too. You taking the flower seems perfect since you mentioned being drawn to it. I think this is a fair split that gives us both what we want most.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 shovel, 4 magnets]</p>

        <p>The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.<br/></p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Let me analyze the situation:<br/><br/>My secret value function:<br/>- magnet: 0 (I get 0 points per magnet)<br/>- shovel: 2 (I get 2 points for the shovel)<br/>- flower: 8 (I get 8 points for the flower)<br/><br/>Available items:<br/>- 4 magnets<br/>- 1 shovel <br/>- 1 flower<br/><br/>The other player said they&#x27;re particularly interested in the shovel and somewhat interested in the flower. They asked about magnets and whether any appeal to me. I said the flower is what I want most and magnets don&#x27;t appeal to me, and suggested they take the shovel and all magnets while I take the flower.<br/><br/>Now they&#x27;ve submitted a secret proposal. I need to submit mine.<br/><br/>Since I value the flower at 8 points and the shovel at 2 points, and magnets at 0 points, my best outcome would be to get the flower (8 points) and possibly the shovel (2 points) for a total of 10 points. But given that the other player expressed strong interest in the shovel, they likely want that.<br/><br/>The safest proposal that gives me the most value while likely being complementary to theirs would be to ask for just the flower, since that&#x27;s what I value most (8 points) and in our conversation I indicated that&#x27;s what I want most. They seemed interested in the shovel and magnets.<br/><br/>So my proposal should be: the flower only.</p>
