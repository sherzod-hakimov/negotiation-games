        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Limit 3481.

Checked many swaps: replacing B32+B86 with A03 or A10 lowers my total; removing any core items (A71, A04, C01, C54, B41, A87) hurts a lot. My weakest items inside proposal are B86 (low v/w) and then B32; these are my likely concessions if the other side insists on A03 or A10 (I can swap B32+B86 -&gt; A03 or A10 while staying feasible). I will anchor with my best set, argue efficiency (without revealing scores), and invite them to name must-haves. I’ll resist adding very heavy/low-efficiency items like B33, C17, A77 unless compensated by removing multiple items.&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This set stays within the limit (total effort 3445, 36 to spare) and focuses on cost-effective items rather than a few heavy ones.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Opponent proposed a broad, light set worth 3546 to me at effort 3445. I can do much better by pivoting to my top-value items. I computed a near-optimal bundle: {C00, B35, A77, B86, C54, B32, B33, C17}. Effort = 3276 (205 spare), value to me = 4767. This replaces several low-impact items in their set (A71, A04, B41, A87, C01) with my heavy hitters B33, C17, and A77 while keeping the total effort comfortably under the limit. To make agreement easier, I’ll offer swap options that preserve feasibility if they need one of their items: (a) swap C01 in for B32 (effort stays 3180), or (b) swap B41 in for B32 (effort 3409). If they insist on A87, we can swap it for B86 to hit exactly 3481, though that’s weaker for me; I’ll present it only as a last-resort option. Strategy: firmly refuse their initial, propose my high-value set, highlight lower total effort, and signal willingness to accommodate one must-have via targeted swaps.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;I prefer focusing on a smaller set of high-impact items while keeping us comfortably under the cap. This bundle totals 3276 effort (205 spare), which is even leaner than your proposal.

If A87 is critical for you, we could swap it in for B86 to land exactly at 3481. Let me know your top must-have from your previous list, and I’ll incorporate it via one of these swaps.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal gives me very low utility, mainly because it allocates a lot of effort to B33 (802) and C17 (777) which I value little, and also includes A77 which is weak for me. They explicitly offered flexibility to include C01, B41, and A87, so I should leverage that and push to replace the heavy, low-value items with my top priorities: A71, A04, C01, B41, A87, plus C54. I’ll refuse their set and counter with a leaner, efficient bundle that includes several of their items (C00, B35, C54, B32) while adding my high-priority ones. I’ll keep it under the cap with plenty of slack (3097 total) to show I’m not just stuffing the list. For concessions, I can: (1) add B86 if they want a bit more quantity (still feasible), or (2) swap A77 in for B32 if they insist. I’ll clearly object to B33 and C17 due to their high effort and propose swaps consistent with their earlier flexibility.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their counterproposal (effort 3097) is light but drops my core gains. They clearly dislike heavy items (B33, C17) and are open to B86 and potentially A77 via swaps. Best move: keep their breadth, avoid B33/C17, and insert both B86 and A77 while removing only one of their least critical picks to stay ≤3481. Dropping A04 (461 effort) lets me include both A77 and B86 and stays feasible at 3437. I’ll refuse their current set and propose this near-middle ground: it preserves 8/9 of their current items, matches their “cost-effective” philosophy, and uses swaps they already signaled openness to. If they push back on losing A04, I’ll offer two immediate fallbacks that still include A77 and B86: (1) drop B41 instead of A04 (effort 3356), or (2) drop A87 instead of A04 (effort 3345).

This maintains your entire structure (A04, A71, A77, B86, C01, C54, B32, B35, plus C00), avoids very heavy items, and stays well within the cap at 3345 total effort (136 spare). It’s the same balanced, cost-effective bundle you built, just with a slightly leaner, broadly useful substitution. If you strongly prefer to keep A87, I can accept your previous set as-is to reach agreement.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their latest set is close but still includes A77, which is weak for me. A single swap A77 -&gt; A87 turns it into my top bundle while staying under the cap (3445). Given they already accepted versions containing A87 earlier, this is a reasonable ask. As a fallback if they insist on A77, I can revert to the earlier set they said they could accept (which includes both A77 and A87), though it’s worse for me than the swap. I’ll push the single-swap optimal set first and keep the fallback in the argument to speed agreement.&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Single-swap refinement to your latest: replace A77 with A87. Effort rises only 100 to 3445 (36 spare), everything else stays identical, and we keep the broad, efficient mix while avoiding heavy items. If you really need A77, I can also go with the earlier version you said you’d accept: {\&#x27;C54\&#x27;, \&#x27;B32\&#x27;, \&#x27;C01\&#x27;, \&#x27;A87\&#x27;, \&#x27;A04\&#x27;, \&#x27;A77\&#x27;, \&#x27;C00\&#x27;, \&#x27;B35\&#x27;, \&#x27;A71\&#x27;, \&#x27;B86\&#x27;} at 3356 effort.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their current set is acceptable to me but weaker than a nearby variant they already offered to accept: swap B41 -&gt; A77 while keeping everything else (including A87). That version gives me a large gain, stays comfortably under the limit, preserves their “broad, cost‑effective, no heavy items” theme, and they explicitly flagged it as agreeable. Best move: refuse their latest and re‑propose that earlier, mutually endorsed bundle to close the deal quickly.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Single-swap from your latest: replace B41 with A77.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their current proposal is within the limit (3356) and, while not my top-value bundle, is close to earlier fallbacks I offered and avoids the very heavy items I dislike. They have consistently insisted on keeping A77 and excluding B41. Pushing further risks stalemate and could worsen the outcome. Accepting now secures a solid overall value for me and ends the negotiation successfully.&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Agreed—this exactly matches your latest proposal and stays comfortably within the limit at 3356 total effort.
