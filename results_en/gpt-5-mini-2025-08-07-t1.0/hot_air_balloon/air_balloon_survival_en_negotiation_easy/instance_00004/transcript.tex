Sum of these plus A62(111,65) fits at 3060 effort with very high total importance for me (6348). Excluded items are low for me or dominated: C08, B19, C73, A18. I’ll open with this near{-}optimal bundle. I’ll defend it on efficiency/low effort grounds (without revealing my scores) and signal flexibility: A62 is my cheapest give, and if they need a heavy item, I’d consider trading around A62 and, if pushed, negotiating around A67/C61 only for a good swap.
