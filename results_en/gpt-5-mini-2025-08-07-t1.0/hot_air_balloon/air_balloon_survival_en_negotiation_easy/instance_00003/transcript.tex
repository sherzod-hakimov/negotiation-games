	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Goal: maximize my total importance under effort limit 3712. I computed values/efforts and solved a near-knapsack: top-efficiency/importance items for me are A43, C10, C61, C42, C55, A67, B42, with B36 and C67 as good fillers. Starting from that core (effort 2741, value 5312), the best use of remaining capacity 971 is B36 (374,461) + C67 (578,389) = 952 effort, 850 value. Total effort becomes 3693 (≤3712) and total value 6162. I checked swaps: replacing A62 and C43 with C67 improves value; alternatives like adding A18/C73/B19 are worse given the capacity trade-offs. I’ll propose the high-value set and signal flexibility on B36 and C67 for concessions if the other party has must-haves, keeping my core items intact.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A43', 'C10', 'C61', 'C42', 'C55', 'A67', 'B42', 'B36', 'C67'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {"This set stays within the effort limit (3693 ≤ 3712) and focuses on an efficient, well-balanced selection.
