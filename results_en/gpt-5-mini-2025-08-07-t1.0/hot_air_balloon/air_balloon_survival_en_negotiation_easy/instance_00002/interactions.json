With these nine, I had 337 effort left; the best add within that is C08 (329) rather than C43 (151) due to higher value to me. Total effort 3280, leaving a small buffer. I intentionally excluded heavy/low-return-for-me items like A62 (887), B19 (808), C73 (849), and also C67 (602) unless there’s a strong counter-preference from the other side. My plan: anchor with this high-utility set but signal flexibility on small swaps (e.g., C08 <-> C43) and, if they insist on a heavy item, push to remove something I value less (preferably C08 first, then B36) while avoiding cuts to A67/C55/C10/A18/A43/B42. If they counter with a very heavy item like C73/B19, I’ll argue effort-efficiency and propose compensating drops that minimize my loss or suggest alternative lighter items.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'C55', 'A67', 'C10', 'A18', 'A43', 'B42', 'B36', 'C61', 'C42', 'C08'}\nARGUMENT: {'This set is balanced and efficient on effort (total 3280 ≤ 3288) while keeping many low-effort, broadly useful items.
