With remaining capacity I added B00, B12, and C15 which still deliver strong value for their cost. I intentionally excluded very low{-}efficiency or high{-}cost/low{-}value items (e.g., C06, B16, B69, B21, B53, C65, A23, C24, A05, B75, B85). The proposed set totals 8700 effort, leaving a 70 buffer. For negotiation flexibility, the weakest items among my included ones (by my ratios) are C15, B00, and to a lesser extent B12/C81; I can consider swaps if the counterpart highly values an alternative, but only if the total stays <= 8770 and the trade doesn’t significantly hurt my own payoff.
