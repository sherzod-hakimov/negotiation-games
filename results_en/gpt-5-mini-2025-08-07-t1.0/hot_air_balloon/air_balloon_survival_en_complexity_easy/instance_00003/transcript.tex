	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'I computed value/effort ratios from my private importance scores to build a near-optimal knapsack under 8770. Core high-efficiency picks: C34, B45, A27, C70, A30, A84, A89, B60, A08, A16, A66, B46, B94, B67, B09, plus solid-mediums B10, C35, A58, C81. With remaining capacity I added B00, B12, and C15 which still deliver strong value for their cost. I intentionally excluded very low-efficiency or high-cost/low-value items (e.g., C06, B16, B69, B21, B53, C65, A23, C24, A05, B75, B85). The proposed set totals 8700 effort, leaving a 70 buffer. For negotiation flexibility, the weakest items among my included ones (by my ratios) are C15, B00, and to a lesser extent B12/C81; I can consider swaps if the counterpart highly values an alternative, but only if the total stays <= 8770 and the trade doesn’t significantly hurt my own payoff. I will start with my high-value proposal and invite targeted swap suggestions.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A08', 'A27', 'B94', 'A89', 'B67', 'B45', 'C34', 'B60', 'A16', 'C35', 'B10', 'B09', 'C81', 'A58', 'A30', 'A66', 'B46', 'C70', 'B00', 'B12', 'C15', 'A84'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This set uses 8700 effort (≤ 8770) and prioritizes items that deliver strong benefit for the effort, leaving a small buffer. If you need to accommodate one of your priorities, propose a concrete swap of similar effort. I can be somewhat flexible on a couple of mid-tier items (for example, we could discuss replacing B00 or C15) as long as we stay within the limit. If this works for you as is, please AGREE; otherwise, suggest specific substitutions you prefer.'}
