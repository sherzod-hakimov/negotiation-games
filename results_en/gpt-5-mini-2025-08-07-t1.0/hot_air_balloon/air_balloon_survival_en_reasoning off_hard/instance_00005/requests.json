This stays within the LIMIT (2305 ≤ 2307), increases coverage with two slots instead of one, and preserves the low-effort anchors you value. B93 is the only sticking point for me. If you can accept this swap, we have a deal. If A11 is difficult on your side, I can instead include B20 in place of A11 while keeping everything else the same and still stay well under the limit. Can you agree to this package?'}"

This keeps all six shared core items plus your A60 and C08, drops B93 per your concern, and stays comfortably under the LIMIT (total effort 2042 ≤ 2307). It’s a clean, balanced compromise that preserves the anchors we both value. Can you accept this package now?'}"
