This keeps our six compact items plus C85 and B09 intact, stays well under the limit (total 3259), and preserves the balance you wanted. If you strongly prefer keeping C81, I can consider that, but then I’d ask for B31 → B93 as a counter-swap to maintain overall efficiency.&quot;}</p>

This stays under the limit (total effort 3421, 208 spare) and continues to avoid the items you flagged as weak (B33, B21, C81). You’d get B93, which you were open to, with no other changes. If B93 is a blocker, I can accept the earlier variant that swaps B96 → C81 and keeps the rest intact; that also fits comfortably.&quot;}</p>
