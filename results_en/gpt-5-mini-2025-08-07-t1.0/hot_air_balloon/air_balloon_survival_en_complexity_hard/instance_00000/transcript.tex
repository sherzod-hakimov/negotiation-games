Starting from a 9730{-}effort pack of top ratio items, I noticed we had 343 effort slack. The best single upgrade within that slack was swapping B23 (657) for B43 (997), which raises my total importance more than alternative swaps like A28{-}>A94. This yields total effort 10070 (≤10073) and maximizes my utility among simple single{-}swap improvements. I also checked other combinations (e.g., A28{-}>A94, A71{-}>A96) and multi{-}swap options; none exceeded the B43 swap given the remaining slack. If the other side pushes back, my lowest{-}leverage items for me among those included are around the mid{-}tier (e.g., A28, B15, B37, C72), so I can trade one of those for one of their must{-}haves of comparable effort if needed, as long as we respect the effort cap.'\}} \\
