	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Maximizing my utility under 7351, I computed an efficient pack by first locking in all high value-per-effort small items (sub-350 effort), then searching combinations of larger items to best use the remaining capacity. The best I found adds A87, A65, and B43 to the efficient core, reaching 7346 total effort and 9894 total value for me. I tested many alternative triples (e.g., with C83, C84, B95, C10, C17, B64, B16, C60, C72) and none beat A87+A65+B43 within capacity. If they push for a different heavy item, my plan is to keep the small, efficient items fixed and consider swapping among the big ones with minimal loss to me—e.g., swapping A87 for C83 (slightly worse for me), or trading B43 for another heavy only if compensated by dropping something else, since we’re just 5 under the limit. As concessions, the least painful swaps for me are among the large items with similar efficiency (A87/C83/C84/C10/B95/B64/B16/C60/C17). I will present the strong near-tight proposal and signal willingness to trade among the big-ticket items while holding the small core fixed.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'C53', 'A28', 'A88', 'A39', 'B81', 'A71', 'B37', 'A75', 'B19', 'A65', 'A46', 'B96', 'A25', 'A87', 'A08', 'C51', 'B34', 'B69', 'C79', 'A97', 'B15', 'A96', 'A94', 'B23', 'C82', 'B43'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'I built this set to maximize overall benefit per unit effort: it includes essentially all the low-effort, high-impact items first, then adds three highly efficient larger items (A87, A65, B43) to utilize the capacity with only 5 effort to spare. This keeps the plan lean while covering a broad mix across categories. If you have a strong preference for a different large item (e.g., C83, C84, C10, B95, C17, B64, B16, C60), I’m open to swapping among the big-ticket items while aiming to keep the many small, efficient pieces intact so we stay within the limit.'}
