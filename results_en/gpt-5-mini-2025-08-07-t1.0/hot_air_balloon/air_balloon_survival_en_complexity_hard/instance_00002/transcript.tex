I computed value/effort ratios from my private importances and built a high{-}efficiency base: many small, very efficient items plus mid{-}size ones with strong ratios. Initial greedy set used 9076 effort for value 11284. I then improved it by replacing two relatively lower{-}ratio picks (B19 655/751 and C17 89/185) with A87 (962/1058), exploiting the 246 spare effort; this raised my total value by +122 while staying within the limit. I tested further swaps to add other large items (A97, C60, B16, A96, etc.), but each required removing combinations that reduced my total value. The current set uses 9294 effort (28 spare) and is, for my utility, a strong local optimum. Strategy now: open with this near{-}limit, high{-}efficiency proposal and invite targeted swaps if the other party has must{-}haves; I will try to trade out the least costly (to me) items of similar effort to accommodate them without revealing my scores.'\}} \\

I computed my total importance for their set as 11,406 at total effort 9,294 (28 under limit). I explored many swaps to add high{-}importance items not in their set (B81, B37, B23, C83, B34, C51, A96, A75, A97, C60, B16, B19). Most swaps were net negative given the strong ratios of current items. However, I found a strictly better swap for me that still respects the limit: replace A87 (effort 962) with B81 (896) plus C17 (89). This uses 896+89=985 effort—only +23 compared to A87—and fits under the 9322 limit (new total 9317). This increases my total importance by +119 compared to the original set while changing only one slot on their side (one{-}for{-}two swap), which aligns with their openness to “one or two must{-}have items.” As a backup if they resist B81, a slightly smaller gain comes from replacing A87 with B37 + C17 (+115).
