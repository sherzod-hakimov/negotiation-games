Starting from high benefit-per-effort items (C17, A75, A28, C60, A97, A88, etc.), I added strong mid-weight picks and then optimized via swaps. Key improvements were: swap A96→A71 (+70 value-weight balance), C82→B96 (big value jump with manageable weight), and C10→A94 (+67). Final set weight is 8124 (21 under limit) with high total value for me. I’ll protect core high-impact items (B96, A94, A71, A87) and very efficient smalls (C17, A75, A28, C60, A97, A88). I’m most flexible on some mid-tier items (e.g., B37, B95, B64, C83, A46, C84) if needed to include one of their top priorities, provided we stay within the limit and maintain strong overall value for me.'}\nARGUMENT: {'Here is a balanced, efficient set that stays under the limit by 21. It emphasizes strong benefit per effort and a good spread across categories.
