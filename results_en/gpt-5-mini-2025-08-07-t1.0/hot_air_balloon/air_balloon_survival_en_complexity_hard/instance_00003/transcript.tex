For concessions if needed, my least critical among included are, in order, roughly B96, then A87, then C60 (all still decent but comparatively the weakest by efficiency for me).

I evaluated swaps to include any of the eight excluded heavy items (A08, B95, C10, A25, A94, B34, B19, C72). Their value/effort ratios (\textasciitilde{}1.10–1.14) are not better than many included smaller items (several >2 and many \textasciitilde{}1.2–1.3). Any swap to fit a heavy item would require dropping multiple highly efficient small items, leading to a net loss in my importance. I tested several combinations (e.g., replacing B96/C60 or A87/A75 plus fillers with A08, or adding B34/C10/C72) and each decreased my total importance. There is also only 20 effort slack, so we can’t add anything extra. Therefore, the current proposal is near{-}optimal for me and I should accept immediately to lock in this favorable outcome."\}} \\
