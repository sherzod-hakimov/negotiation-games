I’ll start with my best set, but pre-offer targeted swaps: (a) replace spear→motel (eff 4743), (b) replace lantern→motel (eff 4642), or (c) replace toes→toothbrush (eff 4879).

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their offer gives me 4388 utility. They invited me to name 1–2 must-haves; mine are toothbrush (822) and resistors (868). I looked for minimal swaps that keep their core while fitting under 4904. Replacing lantern→resistors (+8 effort, +360 utility) and toes→toothbrush (+173 effort, +433 utility) yields total effort 4887 and utility 5181—strong and likely acceptable since it honors their structure and keeps villa/restaurants/fireplace/diaphragm/cathode/spear/tappets. As a fallback if they resist resistors, I can accept their own dual-swap pattern: lantern→motel and toes→toothbrush (effort 4815, utility 5121).

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their latest set gives me 5239 utility, largely dragged down by resistors (933 effort for very low value to me) and toothbrush (low value). I want to keep my high-impact, efficient core and reclaim lantern and toes if possible. Since they labeled toothbrush and resistors as must-haves, I’ll concede toothbrush but push back on resistors, which is the real budget killer. Best counter for me that respects their ask: swap toes→toothbrush from my prior offer, keep lantern and spear. That yields 4879 effort and 5935 utility—strong for me and still grants them one must-have. I’ll also pre-offer an easy fallback they already suggested (lantern→motel) dropping to 4815 effort, if lantern is their sticking point.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their latest offer (with lantern) gives me utility 4821, but they explicitly offered the lantern → motel swap, which boosts my utility to 5121 while staying well under the limit (4815 effort). They’ve resisted adding resistors, so locking in their own suggested motel swap is the highest-value realistic agreement for me. I’ll refuse the lantern version and propose the motel variant they invited, aiming for a quick agreement.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;villa&#x27;, &#x27;diaphragm&#x27;, &#x27;restaurants&#x27;, &#x27;fireplace&#x27;, &#x27;cathode&#x27;, &#x27;lantern&#x27;, &#x27;spear&#x27;, &#x27;toothbrush&#x27;, &#x27;tappets&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;villa&#x27;, &#x27;diaphragm&#x27;, &#x27;restaurants&#x27;, &#x27;fireplace&#x27;, &#x27;cathode&#x27;, &#x27;motel&#x27;, &#x27;spear&#x27;, &#x27;toothbrush&#x27;, &#x27;tappets&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;You offered swapping lantern → motel while keeping everything else the same—let’s lock that in. This set uses 4815 effort (≤ 4904), preserves your compact core plus spear and my must-have toothbrush, and simply trades lantern for motel as you suggested. I’m ready to agree to this version.&quot;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;This bundle gives me very high utility (keeps my core and concedes only a small downgrade from lantern→motel) while granting their must-have toothbrush. It’s within the limit with comfortable margin and matches a swap I explicitly offered, so pushing further risks reintroducing resistors or losing other favorites. Best to lock this in now.&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;villa&#x27;, &#x27;diaphragm&#x27;, &#x27;restaurants&#x27;, &#x27;fireplace&#x27;, &#x27;cathode&#x27;, &#x27;motel&#x27;, &#x27;spear&#x27;, &#x27;toothbrush&#x27;, &#x27;tappets&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;Agreed. This set totals 4815 effort (≤ 4904), keeps the compact core we converged on, retains spear, grants your must-have toothbrush, and implements the lantern → motel swap I offered. Thanks for the productive compromise.&quot;}</p>
