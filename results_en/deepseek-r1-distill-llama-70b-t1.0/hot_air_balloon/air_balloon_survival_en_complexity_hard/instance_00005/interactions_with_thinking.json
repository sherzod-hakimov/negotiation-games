Since I don't know the other player's importance values, I need to make strategic moves based on my own and try to anticipate theirs.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the items along with their effort and my importance. Maybe prioritizing items that give me the highest importance per effort ratio would be a good starting point. That way, I can get the most value without using too much effort.\n\nLet me calculate the importance per effort for each item:\n\n- A08: 616/518 \u2248 1.189\n- B95: 754/656 \u2248 1.149\n- A39: 194/96 \u2248 2.021 (highest so far)\n- A65: 878/780 \u2248 1.125\n- B81: 288/190 \u2248 1.516\n- B34: 322/224 \u2248 1.436\n- A28: 329/231 \u2248 1.425\n- C82: 279/181 \u2248 1.541\n- B69: 410/312 \u2248 1.314\n- A87: 1026/928 \u2248 1.105\n- B64: 924/826 \u2248 1.119\n- B15: 199/101 \u2248 1.970\n- C79: 159/61 \u2248 2.607 (this is the highest)\n- B16: 912/814 \u2248 1.121\n- C53: 420/322 \u2248 1.304\n- C83: 998/900 \u2248 1.110\n- C10: 842/744 \u2248 1.132\n- A97: 248/150 \u2248 1.653\n- A25: 163/65 \u2248 2.507\n- C84: 951/853 \u2248 1.115\n- A71: 552/454 \u2248 1.215\n- B23: 252/154 \u2248 1.635\n- B96: 335/237 \u2248 1.414\n- C51: 143/45 \u2248 3.178 (highest)\n- C17: 864/766 \u2248 1.127\n- B19: 392/294 \u2248 1.333\n- C72: 1083/985 \u2248 1.099\n- A94: 451/353 \u2248 1.278\n- A46: 158/60 \u2248 2.633\n- B43: 702/604 \u2248 1.163\n- B37: 190/92 \u2248 2.065\n- A88: 552/454 \u2248 1.215\n- A96: 304/206 \u2248 1.475\n- C60: 911/813 \u2248 1.121\n- A75: 332/234 \u2248 1.418\n\nLooking at this, the top ratios are C51 (3.178), C79 (2.607), A39 (2.021), A25 (2.507), A46 (2.633), B37 (2.065), B15 (1.970), and so on.\n\nI should prioritize items with the highest ratios first. But I also need to consider the total effort.\n\nIf I start by selecting the highest ratio items:\n\n1. C51: effort 45, importance 143\n2. C79: 61, 159\n3. A46: 60, 158\n4. A25: 65, 163\n5. A39: 96, 194\n6. B37: 92, 190\n7. B15: 101, 199\n\nAdding these up: 45+61+60+65+96+92+101 = 520. That's way under 7351. So I can definitely include more.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNext highest ratios are A96 (1.475), B96 (1.414), C53 (1.304), etc.\n\nLet me see the cumulative effort as I add more items. But maybe it's better to pick all items with high ratios first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a combination of high ratio and medium ratio items can give a better total importance.\n\nWait, but the other player also has their own importance values. They might prioritize different items. So perhaps I should aim for a set that includes as many high-importance items for me, but also considering the effort to stay within the limit.\n\nAlternatively, since the other player's priorities are unknown, it might be safer to include a variety, ensuring that I'm covering items that could be valuable to both parties, making it harder for them to refuse.\n\nWait, but I don't know their importance, so maybe I should focus purely on maximizing mine, assuming they'll try to do the same.\n\nAnother approach: try to include the highest importance items for me, but within the effort limit.\n\nLet me see what's my total effort if I take the top 10 by ratio:\n\nC51, C79, A46, A25, A39, B37, B15, C84, A08, B95.\n\nWait, let me calculate this step by step.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should create a list sorted by importance per effort.\n\nWait, here's the list sorted by importance/effort descending:\n\nC51 (3.178), C79 (2.607), A25 (2.507), A46 (2.633), A39 (2.021), B15 (1.970), B37 (2.065), A96 (1.475), B96 (1.414), C53 (1.304), B34 (1.436), A28 (1.425), C82 (1.541), B19 (1.333), etc.\n\nWait, but A46 is 2.633, which is higher than A25's 2.507. So I think I may have miscalculated.\n\nLet me sort properly:\n\n1. C51: 143/45 \u2248 3.178\n2. C79: 159/61 \u2248 2.607\n3. A46: 158/60 \u2248 2.633\n4. A25: 163/65 \u2248 2.507\n5. C84: 951/853 \u2248 1.115\nWait, no, C84 is lower. Wait, no, after A25 comes A39: 194/96 \u2248 2.021\nBut wait, B37: 190/92 \u2248 2.065 which is higher than A39.\n\nSo after A25 (2.507), the next would be B37 (2.065), then A39 (2.021).\n\nSo the top 10 are:\n\nC51, C79, A46, A25, B37, A39, B15, (1.970), maybe C10? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, after A39, the next is B15 (199/101\u22481.970), then C10 (842/744\u22481.132) no, lower. Then C82: 279/181\u22481.541.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all sorted by ratio:\n\nOrder:\n\n1. C51: 3.178\n2. C79: 2.607\n3. A46: 2.633\n4. A25: 2.507\n5. B37: 2.065\n6. A39: 2.021\n7. B15: 1.970\n8. C82: 1.541\n9. B81: 1.516\n10. B34: 1.436\n11. A28: 1.425\n12. C53: 1.304\n13. B69: 1.314\n14. B96: 1.414\n15. A96: 1.475\n16. B19: 1.333\n...\nContinuing like this.\n\nSo, to create a proposal, I should include as many of the highest ratio items as possible without exceeding the effort limit. Since the limit is 7351, which is quite high, I should aim to include many items, but focusing on those that give me the highest importance per unit effort.\n\nHowever, including too many might not be the best if some items are crucial for the other player. But since I don't know their priorities, I need to maximize mine.\n\nLet me start adding items until I reach close to 7351.\n\nStart with C51 (45) total effort=45\nAdd C79 (61) total=106\nAdd A46 (60) total=166\nAdd A25 (65) total=231\nAdd B37 (92) total=323\nAdd A39 (96) total=419\nAdd B15 (101) total=520\nAdd C82 (181) total=701\nAdd B81 (190) total=891\nAdd B34 (224) total=1115\nAdd A28 (231) total=1346\nAdd B69 (312) total=1658\nAdd A08 (518) total=2176\nAdd C53 (322) total=2498\nAdd B96 (237) total=2735\nAdd C10 (744) total=3479\nAdd A71 (454) total=3933\nAdd A65 (780) total=4713\nAdd B95 (656) total=5369\nAdd B64 (826) total=6195\nAdd C83 (900) total=7095 (over the limit).\n\nWait, adding up to C83 would exceed. So stop before.\n\nSo up to B64, the total is 6195, which is under 7351. Remaining effort: 7351-6195=1156.\n\nLooking for next items with high ratio. Next would be A87 (928) which is too big, but 928>1156? No, wait, 928 is within 1156.\n\nWait, after B64 (826), total is 6195. So remaining 1156.\n\nNext item in high ratio is A87 (928), which is less than 1156. So add A87: 928, total effort 6195+928=7123, remaining 7351-7123=228.\n\nNext, items with effort \u2264228. Looking back, which high ratio items have effort \u2264228.\n\nLooking for items not yet included. Let's see:\n\nIncluded so far: C51, C79, A46, A25, B37, A39, B15, C82, B81, B34, A28, B69, A08, C53, B96, C10, A71, A65, B95, B64, A87.\n\nWhat's left with effort \u2264228 and high ratio?\n\nCheck A97: 150, not included yet. Its ratio is 248/150\u22481.653.\n\nAdding A97: 150, total effort 7123+150=7273, remaining=78.\n\nNext, any items with effort \u226478? Let's see. The only one is C51 is already included. There's A25 (65), included. C79 (61), included. A46 (60), included. A97 (150), included.\n\nNext, perhaps B16 has effort 814 which is too big. Wait, 814 is over 78. So no more items can be added.\n\nSo the total importance would be sum of all these items' importance.\n\nBut maybe I can replace some lower ratio items with higher ones, but given the effort, perhaps it's better to include as much as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps instead of including A87 (effort 928, importance 1026), which is a high effort, maybe it's better to include more smaller items with higher ratios. Let's see: If I don't include A87, I can include A97 (150), and then perhaps others.\n\nLet me recalculate without A87:\n\nAfter B64, total effort is 6195. Remaining effort 1156.\n\nI can add A97 (150), total=6345, remaining=1006.\n\nNext, perhaps A75 (234), which is 234. Adding it: total=6345+234=6579, remaining=772.\n\nThen, perhaps C60 (813), which is 813. 6579+813=7392, which is over 7351. So can't include C60.\n\nAlternatively, add B23 (154): 6345+154=6499, remaining=852.\n\nThen add A94 (353): 6499+353=6852, remaining=499.\n\nThen add A88 (454) is too big. Remaining 499, so not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after adding A75, total=6579. Remaining 772.\n\nWhat's next? A46 is already included. Maybe C17 (766), which is 766>772? No, 766<772. So add C17: 766, total=6579+766=7345, remaining=6. Then add the smallest item, which is C51 (45), but it's already included. So cannot add more.\n\nSo this way, total effort is 7345, which allows me to include more items.\n\nBut this seems better.

The key is that this selection gives me a high total importance.\n\nBut perhaps the other player might refuse this proposal if it includes items they value highly. So maybe I should make sure to include some items that are less important to me but might be important to them, to encourage them to agree.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't know their preferences, I might as well go for the maximum possible.\n\nAnother approach is to include a mix of high ratio items and some medium ones, ensuring a balanced set that's hard for the other player to refuse.\n\nAlternatively, I could start with a proposal that includes the top 10 high ratio items and see if the other player agrees or refuses.\n\nWait, but the effort of top 10 high ratio items is 45+61+60+65+92+96+101+181+190+224= 1024, which is way under the limit. Maybe including more would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps propose a smaller set that includes the very top items to test the waters, and then negotiate from there.\n\nBut given the limit is 7351, which is quite large, I can include a lot.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to select all items where effort is below a certain threshold, say 200, and have high importance.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just make a proposal that includes as many high ratio items as possible without exceeding the limit.\n\nSo my initial proposal would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'C51', 'C79', 'A46', 'A25', 'B37', 'A39', 'B15', 'C82', 'B81', 'B34', 'A28', 'B69', 'A08', 'C53', 'B96', 'C10', 'A71', 'A65', 'B95', 'B64', 'A97', 'A75', 'C17'}\n\nBut let me check the effort total:\n\n45+61=106+60=166+65=231+92=323+96=419+101=520+181=701+190=891+224=1115+231=1346+312=1658+518=2176+322=2498+237=2735+744=3479+454=3933+780=4713+656=5369+826=6195+150=6345+234=6579+766=7345.\n\nYes, total effort 7345, which is within the limit.\n\nThe total importance is 9599, which is great for me.\n\nBut I'm concerned the other player might refuse because they might have some items in here that are crucial for them. Maybe I can include some items they might value more, but I don't know which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can include some medium-effort items that I don't value as much but might be valuable to them.\n\nBut without their data, I have to go with my own strategy.\n\nSo I think I should propose this set, as it maximizes my total importance without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nIf the other player refuses, I can try to adjust by swapping some items.\n\nSo my first move is to make this PROPOSAL.\n"

The goal is to maximize my own total importance, but I can't see the other person's importance values. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem deeply. I have a list of items with their respective effort values and my own importance values. The other person has their own importance values which I don't know. The challenge is to propose or negotiate a set of items that stays within the effort limit while getting as much importance as possible for myself.\n\nLooking at the initial attempt, I made a proposal without starting with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag, which was a mistake. The response I got pointed that out, so I need to correct that. \n\nNow, I should think about how to structure my next move. I need to start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then make a PROPOSAL or another action. Since the initial proposal was rejected, I should probably come up with a better proposal or negotiate further.\n\nI'll calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item I have. This will help me prioritize items that give me the most importance per unit of effort. By doing this, I can select items that are efficient for me, which might also be a good starting point for negotiation.\n\nLet me list out all the items with their effort and my importance:\n\n- A08: Effort 518, Importance 616 \u2192 Ratio \u2248 1.19\n- A39: 96, 194 \u2192 ~2.02\n- A65: 780, 878 \u2192 ~1.12\n- A71: 454, 552 \u2192 ~1.21\n- A75: 234, 332 \u2192 ~1.42\n- A25: 65, 163 \u2192 ~2.51\n- A46: 60, 158 \u2192 ~2.63\n- A28: 231, 329 \u2192 ~1.42\n- A08: 518, 616 \u2192 ~1.19\n- A97: 150, 248 \u2192 ~1.65\n- B15: 101, 199 \u2192 ~1.98\n- B34: 224, 322 \u2192 ~1.43\n- B37: 92, 190 \u2192 ~2.07\n- B81: 190, 288 \u2192 ~1.51\n- B95: 656, 754 \u2192 ~1.15\n- B64: 826, 924 \u2192 ~1.12\n- C51: 45, 143 \u2192 ~3.18\n- C79: 61, 159 \u2192 ~2.60\n- C82: 181, 279 \u2192 ~1.54\n- C10: 744, 842 \u2192 ~1.13\n- C53: 322, 420 \u2192 ~1.30\n- C17: 766, 864 \u2192 ~1.13\n- B23: 154, 252 \u2192 ~1.64\n- B96: 237, 335 \u2192 ~1.41\n- A88: 454, 552 \u2192 ~1.21\n- A94: 353, 451 \u2192 ~1.28\n- B69: 312, 410 \u2192 ~1.31\n- B43: 604, 702 \u2192 ~1.16\n- B19: 294, 392 \u2192 ~1.33\n\nNow, sorting these by the ratio descending:\n\n1. A46: ~2.63\n2. C79: ~2.60\n3. A25: ~2.51\n4. A39: ~2.02\n5. B37: ~2.07\n6. C51: ~3.18 (Wait, I think I missed C51 earlier. It actually has the highest ratio at ~3.18)\n7. A28: ~1.42\n8. A75: ~1.42\n9. B81: ~1.51\n10. B23: ~1.64\n11. A97: ~1.65\n12. B96: ~1.41\n13. B34: ~1.43\n14. C82: ~1.54\n15. B19: ~1.33\n16. C53: ~1.30\n17. B69: ~1.31\n18. A71: ~1.21\n19. A08: ~1.19\n20.

A87: Not in the list because it's too high effort (928) and might not fit.\n29. C72: 985 effort\u2014way over, so exclude.\n30. C83: 900, too high, exclude.\n31. C84: 853, too high, exclude.\n32. B16: 814, high, exclude.\n33. C60: 813, too high.\n34. A87, B96 are already considered.\n\nSo, top items by ratio are C51, A46, C79, A25, A39, B37, C51 again (already listed), and so on.\n\nNow, I need to pick a combination of these that fits under 7351.\n\nBut wait, this is a two-player game. The other person will have their own priorities, so I can't just pick all the top ratio items for myself. I might need to leave some room for their important items, or at least propose a set that is reasonable and might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since the other player's preferences are hidden, my best bet is to maximize my own importance, considering the effort.\n\nBut perhaps the initial proposal I made was too greedy, including too many items with high importance to me, leading the other player to refuse. So I might need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial proposal's total effort was too high? Wait, let's check that.\n\nWait, in the initial response, I included a lot of items. Let me calculate the total effort of that proposal.\n\nOriginal proposal: {'C51', 'C79', 'A46', 'A25', 'B37', 'A39', 'B15', 'C82', 'B81', 'B34', 'A28', 'B69', 'A08', 'C53', 'B96', 'C10', 'A71', 'A65', 'B95', 'B64', 'A97', 'A75', 'C17'}\n\nLet's calculate the total effort:\n\nC51:45, C79:61, A46:60, A25:65, B37:92, A39:96, B15:101, C82:181, B81:190, B34:224, A28:231, B69:312, A08:518, C53:322, B96:237, C10:744, A71:454, A65:780, B95:656, B64:826, A97:150, A75:234, C17:766.\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n45 +61=106, +60=166, +65=231, +92=323, +96=419, +101=520, +181=701, +190=891, +224=1115, +231=1346, +312=1658, +518=2176, +322=2498, +237=2735, +744=3479, +454=3933, +780=4713, +656=5369, +826=6195, +150=6345, +234=6579, +766=7345.\n\nSo total effort is 7345, which is under 7351. So it's within the limit.\n\nBut perhaps the other player refused because the proposal didn't consider their priorities. Maybe they have some must-have items that I excluded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I included items that are low priority for me but high for them, but I can't know.\n\nSince my aim is to maximize my own importance, I need to find a set that includes as many high-importance items for me as possible, without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nBut the other player will only agree if it's beneficial for them as well. So perhaps a balanced approach is needed.\n\nAnother thought: since I don't know their preferences, I should aim to propose a set that is as efficient as possible for me, while possibly including some items that might be low effort but perhaps high importance for them, to entice them to agree.\n\nBut without knowing their values, it's tricky. I have to rely on my own.\n\nSo perhaps I should stick to my initial strategy, but maybe remove some lower ratio items to make room for others.\n\nWait, but in the initial proposal, I included 23 items, which might be too many. Perhaps the other player can't accept that many because it doesn't leave room for their high-importance items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I included some high-effort items like C10:744, which is a big chunk, but for me it's worth 842 importance, so it's a good ratio (~1.13). Similarly, C17:766 effort for 864 importance (~1.13). These are not very high ratios, so maybe I can consider removing some of these to include higher ratio items elsewhere.\n\nWait, in my initial proposal, I included C17, which is 766 effort and 864 importance. That's a high effort but not the highest ratio.\n\nPerhaps I can prioritize items with higher ratios and see if I can include more of those.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about marginal contributions. Once I have a set that's almost full, which items can be swapped in or out to increase my total importance.\n\nBut since this is the first move, perhaps I should make a strong initial proposal and then adjust based on their response.\n\nBut since they refused the first proposal, I need to make a better one.\n\nSo, perhaps I should simplify by focusing on the highest ratio items, not too many, to keep the total effort manageable.\n\nLet me select the top items by ratio until I reach near the limit.\n\nStart with C51 (45). Then add A46 (60) \u2192 105. Then C79 (61) \u2192 166. Then A25 (65) \u2192231. Then A39 (96) \u2192327. Then B37 (92) \u2192419. Then B15 (101) \u2192520. Then C82 (181) \u2192701. Then B81 (190) \u2192891. Then C53 (322) \u21921213. Then A28 (231) \u21921444. Then B96 (237) \u21921681. Then A75 (234) \u21921915. Then B23 (154) \u21922069. Then A97 (150) \u21922219. Then B34 (224) \u21922443. Then B69 (312) \u21922755. Then A08 (518) \u21923273. Then A71 (454) \u21923727. Then C10 (744) \u21924471. Then B64 (826) \u21925297. Then A65 (780) \u21926077. Then B95 (656) \u21926733. Then A88 (454) \u21927187. Then B43 (604) \u21927791.\n\nWait, after adding B43, we've exceeded the limit. So let's see where we are.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, the initial list after adding top ratios up to B43:7791.\n\nBut 7791 is way over 7351. So I need to stop before that.\n\nWait, perhaps after adding A71 (454) \u2192 total effort 3727.\n\nThen adding C10 (744) \u2192 3727+744=4471.\n\nThen adding B64 (826) \u21924471+826=5297.\n\nThen adding A65 (780) \u21925297+780=6077.\n\nThen adding B95 (656) \u21926077+656=6733.\n\n6733 is still under 7351. Next, adding A88 (454) would make it 7187, which is still under.\n\nThen adding B43 (604) would make 7791, which is over. So maximum we can go up to A88, which brings us to 7187, with 7351-7187=164 effort left. So we can add another item with effort \u2264164.\n\nLooking back at remaining items, next highest ratio is B19:294, which is too big. Next is B69:312, too big. Then B96:237, too big. C53:322 is already included. Wait, C53 was included earlier? Yes, I think I added it at 322.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nWait, I think I got confused. Let me list all items in order of priority and add them one by one, keeping track.\n\nStarting with C51:45. Total effort 45, total importance 143.\n\nAdd A46:60. Total effort 105, importance 143+158=301.\n\nAdd C79:61. Total effort 166, importance 301+159=460.\n\nAdd A25:65. Effort 231, importance 460+163=623.\n\nAdd A39:96.

Effort 4471, importance 5589+842=6431.\n\nAdd B64:826. Effort 5297, importance 6431+924=7355.\n\nWait, 5297 effort, adding B64 (effort 826) brings it to 6123, not 5297+826=6123. Then importance 7355.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in adding. Let's recast:\n\nAfter C10:744, effort is 3727+744=4471, importance 5589+842=6431.\n\nThen add B64:826. Effort becomes 4471+826=5297, importance 6431+924=7355.\n\nThen add A65:780. Effort becomes 5297+780=6077, importance 7355+878=8233.\n\nThen add B95:656. Effort 6077+656=6733, importance 8233+754=8987.\n\nThen add A88:454. Effort 6733+454=7187, importance 8987+552=9539.\n\nRemaining effort:7351-7187=164.\n\nNext item: check for items with effort \u2264164 and highest ratio remaining. From the list:\n\nA08 is already added. A28 is added. A25 is added. A39 is added. A46 is added. A71 is added. A75 is added. A88 is added. A97 is added. B08? No, B items: B15, B23, B34, B37, B69, B81, B95, B96 are added.\n\nNext is B19:294, effort too high. B43:604 too high. C17:766 too high. C72:985 too high. C83:900 too high. C84:853 too high. B16:814 too high. C60:813 too high. So the next available item is C51 (already added), C79 (added), C82 (added), C53 (added). Wait, what about C84? No, too high.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let's see:\n\nAfter including up to A88, the remaining effort is 164. Among the remaining items, what's available?\n\nLooking at the initial item list, the remaining items not yet added are:\n\nA08: added, A28: added, A39: added, A46: added, A65: added, A71: added, A75: added, A88: added, A94:353, A97: added, B15: added, B19:294, B23: added, B34: added, B37: added, B43:604, B64: added, B69: added, B81: added, B95: added, B96: added, C10: added, C17:766, C51: added, C53: added, C60:813, C72:985, C79: added, C82: added, C83:900, C84:853.\n\nSo the remaining items that are not in the current set are:\n\nA94:353, B19:294, B43:604, C17:766, C60:813, C72:985, C83:900, C84:853.\n\nAll of these have effort higher than 164 except none. So I can't add any more items. Thus, the proposal includes up to A88 with total effort 7187, and 164 left unused.\n\nBut is this the optimal for me? Let me check if swapping any included items with higher importance per effort could help.\n\nFor example, perhaps instead of including C10 (744 effort, 842 importance, ratio ~1.13), I could include a combination of smaller items that give me more total importance.\n\nLet's calculate: 744 effort could be replaced with items like A94 (353) and B19 (294), but 353+294=647, which is less than 744, but sum is 647. But 744-647=97, and I could add another small item like B37 (already included) or B15 (included). Alternatively, perhaps swapping C10 with A94 and B19, but I need to see the total importance.\n\nC10 gives me 842. A94 gives 451 and B19 gives 392. Total 843. That's almost the same as C10, but uses more effort: 353+294=647 vs C10's 744. Wait, actually, 647<744, which would allow me to add more items. Wait, but A94 and B19 together take 647 effort and give 451+392=843 importance. That's a ratio of 843/647\u22481.30, which is better than C10's 842/744\u22481.13.\n\nSo, replacing C10 with A94 and B19 would free up 744-647=97 effort. With that, I can add another item. For example, A94 and B19 take 647, and I have 97 left, which isn't enough for any remaining items except maybe C51 is already included. So perhaps it's better to swap C10 (1.13) for A94 and B19 (1.30), but that uses less effort but provides almost the same importance. So, the total importance would be similar, but perhaps it's better to have more items, though in this case, it's just two items instead of one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to include C10 because it's one item rather than two, but in terms of effort, it's a wash. So maybe it's better to include A94 and B19 for a slightly better ratio.\n\nBut in terms of total importance, it's almost the same: 842 vs 843. So, maybe swapping C10 with A94 and B19 would be slightly better.\n\nWait, but I can't fit both A94 and B19 because after removing C10 (744), I have 744 effort freed up. Adding A94 (353) and B19 (294), which sum to 647, leaves 97, which can't be filled. Alternatively, I could include A94 (353) and look for another small item.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to include A94 and leave the rest as is. Let me try recalculating.\n\nIf I remove C10 (744) and add A94 (353) and B19 (294), total effort used becomes:\n\n7187 (total with A88) -744 (C10) +353 (A94) +294 (B19) =7187-744=6433 +647=6480.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 7187 is the total including C10. So to remove C10, subtract 744, then add 647, making 7187-744+647=7187-97=7090.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 7187 includes up to A88, which already includes C10. So perhaps I need to recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the set from scratch, considering this swap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on the initial proposal and see if it's better to adjust it or propose a new one.\n\nConsidering time constraints, perhaps I should proceed to make a new proposal that includes the highest ratio items, but not too many, making it more likely for the other player to accept.\n\nSo, perhaps I'll create a proposal that includes the top 15 items by ratio, and see if that fits.\n\nBut the key is to make a proposal that's efficient for me and perhaps more balanced.\n\nAlternatively, since in the initial proposal I included 23 items totaling 7345, which is just under the limit, and it was refused, perhaps I should try a slightly smaller set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about including some high-importance items for the other player to make the proposal more enticing.\n\nBut without knowing their preferences, it's challenging.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to make a new proposal that includes the top ratio items, ensuring the total effort is within the limit, and perhaps exclude some lower-ratio items to make it more acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to include a mix of high and medium ratio items to have a balanced proposal.\n\nBut perhaps it's best to stick with the initial approach, starting with the highest ratios and including as many as possible within the limit.\n\nSo, perhaps I'll make a new proposal that includes the top 20 items by ratio, and see if that's acceptable.\n\nBut to do that, I need to ensure the total effort is within 7351.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use a knapsack algorithm, but since I don't have the other player's data, I can only maximize my own.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps I should proceed with a new proposal, starting fresh.\n\nI'll list the items again in order of importance to effort ratio:\n\n1. C51:45, ratio 3.18\n2. A46:60, ratio 2.63\n3. C79:61, ratio 2.60\n4. A25:65, ratio 2.51\n5. A39:96, ratio 2.02\n6. B37:92, ratio 2.07\n7. A28:231, ratio 1.42\n8. A75:234, ratio 1.42\n9.

C60:813, ratio 1.12\n\nNow, let's try adding items until we reach near 7351.\n\nStart with C51:45. Total effort 45, imp 143.\n\nAdd A46:60 \u2192 105, imp 143+158=301.\n\nAdd C79:61 \u2192166, imp 301+159=460.\n\nAdd A25:65 \u2192231, imp 460+163=623.\n\nAdd A39:96 \u2192327, imp 623+194=817.\n\nAdd B37:92 \u2192419, imp 817+190=1007.\n\nAdd B15:101 \u2192520, imp 1007+199=1206.\n\nAdd C82:181 \u2192701, imp 1206+279=1485.\n\nAdd B81:190 \u2192891, imp 1485+288=1773.\n\nAdd C53:322 \u21921213, imp 1773+420=2193.\n\nAdd A28:231 \u21921444, imp 2193+329=2522.\n\nAdd B96:237 \u21921681, imp 2522+335=2857.\n\nAdd A75:234 \u21921915, imp 2857+332=3189.\n\nAdd B23:154 \u21922069, imp 3189+252=3441.\n\nAdd A97:150 \u21922219, imp 3441+248=3689.\n\nAdd B34:224 \u21922443, imp 3689+322=4011.\n\nAdd B69:312 \u21922755, imp 4011+410=4421.\n\nAdd A08:518 \u21923273, imp 4421+616=5037.\n\nAdd A71:454 \u21923727, imp 5037+552=5589.\n\nAdd C10:744 \u21924471, imp 5589+842=6431.\n\nAdd B64:826 \u21925297, imp 6431+924=7355.\n\nAdd A65:780 \u21926077, imp 7355+878=8233.\n\nAdd B95:656 \u21926733, imp 8233+754=8987.\n\nAdd A88:454 \u21927187, imp 8987+552=9539.\n\nRemaining effort:7351-7187=164.\n\nNow, check for items with effort \u2264164 that haven't been added yet.\n\nLooking back, the next items are A94:353 (too high), B19:294 (too high), B43:604 (too high), etc. So I can't add any more items.\n\nThis brings me back to the same situation as before. The total effort is 7187, with 164 left, which isn't enough for any remaining items.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum I can do is 7187, with a total importance of 9539.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can swap some items to utilize the remaining 164 effort. For example, removing C10 (744) and adding A94 (353) and B19 (294), but that would require removing C10 and adding both, which would decrease effort from 744 to 647, freeing 97, which isn't enough for another item. But that would only increase my importance by 451+392=843 instead of 842 from C10. So it's almost the same in terms of importance but uses less effort. So total effort becomes 7187-744+647=7187-97=7090, but that leaves more effort unused, which isn't beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can replace C10 with A94 and another small item, but I don't have any small items left. So perhaps it's better to keep C10.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to make a proposal that includes all the top ratio items up to A88, totaling 9539 importance, with 7187 effort.\n\nBut since the initial proposal was refused, I need to think of a different approach. Maybe instead of including so many items, I should focus on the most critical ones, ensuring that I include some high-importance items for the other player, but I can't know which ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can negotiate by offering a compromise, offering to remove certain items if they agree. But since I can't communicate directly, I have to make a proposal that is attractive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a smaller proposal, focusing on the top 10 items by ratio and see.\n\nSo, top 10:\n\n1. C51:45\n2. A46:60\n3. C79:61\n4. A25:65\n5. A39:96\n6. B37:92\n7. B15:101\n8. C82:181\n9. B81:190\n10. C53:322\n\nLet's see total effort:45+60=105+61=166+65=231+96=327+92=419+101=520+181=701+190=891+322=1213.\n\nTotal effort 1213, which is way under 7351. So I can include more.\n\nBut this leaves too much effort unused. So perhaps including up to 20 items.\n\nLet's see up to B23:154.\n\nContinuing from above:\n\nAfter 10 items: effort 1213.\n\n11. A28:231 \u21921444\n12. B96:237 \u21921681\n13. A75:234 \u21921915\n14. B23:154 \u21922069\n15. A97:150 \u21922219\n16. B34:224 \u21922443\n17. B69:312 \u21922755\n18. A08:518 \u21923273\n19. A71:454 \u21923727\n20. C10:744 \u21924471\n\nAt 20 items, effort is 4471. Remaining effort:7351-4471=2880. So I can add more.\n\nContinuing:\n\n21. B64:826 \u21925297\n22. A65:780 \u21926077\n23. B95:656 \u21926733\n24. A88:454 \u21927187\n\nRemaining effort:164.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nThus, the maximum I can get without exceeding the limit is 7187 effort, with 9539 importance.\n\nSince the initial proposal was refused, perhaps I need to adjust by removing some items to make it more palatable. Maybe the other player values certain items more and can't afford to have them excluded.\n\nBut without knowing, I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the other player wants to include some high-effort items that I didn't include.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should make a different proposal that includes some of the other high-effort items to see if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, I can make an argument in my next message, explaining why my proposal is good, and try to negotiate from there.\n\nSo, in summary, my strategic reasoning is to prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance within the effort limit. My initial proposal was designed to include as many high-ratio items as possible, but it was refused. Therefore, I need to consider a different approach, possibly adjusting the selection to either include fewer items or swap some items to better align with the other player's priorities, which I can only infer by the refusal.\n\nI might need to try a different set, perhaps excluding some items with lower ratios that the other player might not value as much, and include others that might be more appealing.\n\nBut given that I don't know their preferences, I'll proceed with a new proposal that includes a slightly different combination, perhaps focusing on higher importance items for me while leaving some room for their priorities.\n\nAlternatively, I might make an argument to support my proposal, explaining that it efficiently uses the effort limit and includes a broad range of items.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with a new proposal that includes the top items but is a bit more selective.\n"

The other participant has their own importance values, which I don't know, so I need to be strategic about how I propose and negotiate.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the items and their effort values. There's a list of items with specific effort numbers. My importance values are given, so I can calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item. This ratio will help me prioritize items that give me the most importance per unit of effort.\n\nI remember from my previous attempt, I proposed a set of items, but it was refused. That means I need to adjust my strategy. Maybe the other participant didn't find my proposal optimal for them. Perhaps I need to consider a more balanced approach or include items that might be more valuable to them as well.\n\nI'll start by listing all items with their effort and my importance. Then, I'll calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each. Items with higher ratios should be prioritized because they offer more value for the effort spent.\n\nLet me go through each item:\n\n- A08: Effort 518, Importance 616 \u2192 Ratio ~1.19\n- B95: 656, 754 \u2192 ~1.15\n- A39: 96, 194 \u2192 ~2.02\n- A65: 780, 878 \u2192 ~1.12\n- B81: 190, 288 \u2192 ~1.51\n- B34: 224, 322 \u2192 ~1.44\n- A28: 231, 329 \u2192 ~1.42\n- C82: 181, 279 \u2192 ~1.54\n- B69: 312, 410 \u2192 ~1.31\n- A87: 928, 1026 \u2192 ~1.11\n- B64: 826, 924 \u2192 ~1.12\n- B15: 101, 199 \u2192 ~1.97\n- C79: 61, 159 \u2192 ~2.60\n- B16: 814, 912 \u2192 ~1.12\n- C53: 322, 420 \u2192 ~1.30\n- C83: 900, 998 \u2192 ~1.11\n- C10: 744, 842 \u2192 ~1.13\n- A97: 150, 248 \u2192 ~1.65\n- A25: 65, 163 \u2192 ~2.51\n- C84: 853, 951 \u2192 ~1.11\n- A71: 454, 552 \u2192 ~1.21\n- B23: 154, 252 \u2192 ~1.64\n- B96: 237, 335 \u2192 ~1.41\n- C51: 45, 143 \u2192 ~3.18\n- C17: 766, 864 \u2192 ~1.13\n- B19: 294, 392 \u2192 ~1.33\n- C72: 985, 1083 \u2192 ~1.10\n- A94: 353, 451 \u2192 ~1.28\n- A46: 60, 158 \u2192 ~2.65\n- B43: 604, 702 \u2192 ~1.16\n- B37: 92, 190 \u2192 ~2.07\n- A88: 454, 552 \u2192 ~1.21\n- A96: 206, 304 \u2192 ~1.48\n- C60: 813, 911 \u2192 ~1.12\n- A75: 234, 332 \u2192 ~1.42\n\nLooking at these ratios, the highest ones are C51 (3.18), C79 (2.60), A25 (2.51), A46 (2.65), and A39 (2.02). These are items where, for each unit of effort, I get a lot of importance. So, they should be my top priorities.\n\nNext, I need to select a combination of these high-ratio items without exceeding the effort limit. Let me try adding them up:\n\nStart with C51 (45) \u2192 total effort = 45\n\nAdd C79 (61) \u2192 total = 106\n\nAdd A46 (60) \u2192 total = 166\n\nAdd A25 (65) \u2192 total = 231\n\nAdd A39 (96) \u2192 total = 327\n\nNext, B37 (92) \u2192 total = 419\n\nB15 (101) \u2192 total = 520\n\nB96 (237) \u2192 total = 757\n\nA28 (231) \u2192 total = 988\n\nB81 (190) \u2192 total = 1178\n\nC82 (181) \u2192 total = 1359\n\nC53 (322) \u2192 total = 1681\n\nA71 (454) \u2192 total = 2135\n\nB23 (154) \u2192 total = 2289\n\nA97 (150) \u2192 total = 2439\n\nB34 (224) \u2192 total = 2663\n\nB69 (312) \u2192 total = 2975\n\nA08 (518) \u2192 total = 3493\n\nB64 (826) \u2192 total = 4319\n\nA65 (780) \u2192 total = 5099\n\nWait, that's already over the limit. So I need to adjust. Maybe I should include some of the high-effort but high-importance items later. Alternatively, perhaps I should prioritize the highest ratio items and then see which higher-effort items I can include without exceeding the limit.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Start with the top ratio items.\n\nC51 (45) + C79 (61) + A46 (60) + A25 (65) + A39 (96) + B15 (101) + B37 (92) = Total so far: 45+61=106+60=166+65=231+96=327+101=428+92=520.\n\nNext, let's look for the next best ratio items. C53 has a ratio of 1.30. Let's add that (322) \u2192 520+322=842.\n\nThen, maybe B23 (154, 1.64) \u2192 842+154=996.\n\nB96 (237, 1.41) \u2192 996+237=1233.\n\nA28 (231, 1.42) \u2192 1233+231=1464.\n\nC82 (181, 1.54) \u2192 1464+181=1645.\n\nA71 (454, 1.21) \u2192 1645+454=2099.\n\nB81 (190, 1.51) \u2192 2099+190=2289.\n\nB34 (224, 1.44) \u2192 2289+224=2513.\n\nA08 (518, 1.19) \u2192 2513+518=3031.\n\nB64 (826, 1.12) \u2192 3031+826=3857.\n\nA65 (780, 1.12) \u2192 3857+780=4637. That's under 7351, but there's still room. Let's check if we can add more high-ratio items.\n\nLooking back, the next highest ratio items not yet included: A97 (150, 1.65), B69 (312, 1.31), etc.\n\nAdding A97 would bring total to 4637+150=4787.\n\nB69 (312) \u2192 4787+312=5099.\n\nB95 (656, 754) has a ratio of 1.15, but it's a large effort. Adding it would take us to 5099+656=5755, which is under 7351, but perhaps the other participant might prefer including it because it's high importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe including A87 (928, 1026) ratio 1.11. That's a big effort but high importance for me. Adding A87 would take us to 5099+928=6027.\n\nWait, 6027 is still under 7351, so maybe adding that as well.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the total effort doesn't exceed 7351. Let's sum up the proposed items:\n\nC51, C79, A46, A25, A39, B15, B37, C53, B23, B96, A28, C82, A71, B81, B34, A08, B64, A65, A97, B69, A87.\n\nCalculating total effort:\n\n45 (C51) +61 (C79)=106 +60 (A46)=166 +65 (A25)=231 +96 (A39)=327 +101 (B15)=428 +92 (B37)=520 +322 (C53)=842 +154 (B23)=996 +237 (B96)=1233 +231 (A28)=1464 +181 (C82)=1645 +454 (A71)=2099 +190 (B81)=2289 +224 (B34)=2513 +518 (A08)=3031 +826 (B64)=3857 +780 (A65)=4637 +150 (A97)=4787 +312 (B69)=5099 +928 (A87)=6027.\n\nThat's under 7351. There's still room for more items if possible, but I might have included most of the high-ratio ones. Maybe A96 (206, 1.48) could be added: 6027+206=6233.\n\nAnd perhaps B19 (294, 1.33): 6233+294=6527.\n\nAlso, C60 (813, 911) has a ratio of ~1.12. Adding that: 6527+813=7340. That's just under 7351. Perfect.\n\nSo the total effort would be 7340, which is within the limit.\n\nLet me check if I included all the high-ratio items: C51, C79, A46, A25, A39, B15, B37, C53, B23, B96, A28, C82, A71, B81, B34, A08, B64, A65, A97, B69, A87, A96, B19, C60.\n\nWait, that's 23 items. Let me recheck the effort:\n\n45 (C51)\n+61 (C79) =106\n+60 (A46)=166\n+65 (A25)=231\n+96 (A39)=327\n+101 (B15)=428\n+92 (B37)=520\n+322 (C53)=842\n+154 (B23)=996\n+237 (B96)=1233\n+231 (A28)=1464\n+181 (C82)=1645\n+454 (A71)=2099\n+190 (B81)=2289\n+224 (B34)=2513\n+518 (A08)=3031\n+826 (B64)=3857\n+780 (A65)=4637\n+150 (A97)=4787\n+312 (B69)=5099\n+928 (A87)=6027\n+206 (A96)=6233\n+294 (B19)=6527\n+813 (C60)=7340\n\nYes, 7340, which is just under 7351.\n\nThis selection includes the top ratio items and some high-importance, high-effort items that fit within the limit. By including a mix of high-ratio and high-importance items, the proposal should be more appealing to the other participant, as it might cover their priorities as well. This approach aims to maximize my total importance while being collaborative.\n\nI think this is a solid proposal. It maximizes my gains and stays within the effort limit while potentially aligning with the other participant's unknown priorities.\n"
