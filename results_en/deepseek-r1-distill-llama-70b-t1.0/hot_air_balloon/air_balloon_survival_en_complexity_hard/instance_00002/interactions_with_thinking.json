So, the goal is to end up with a set of items that maximizes my total importance while keeping the total effort under 9322. I don't know what the other player values, but they probably have their own priorities based on their unknown importance scores.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by looking at the items and their efforts and my importance for each. Maybe I can prioritize items that give me the highest importance per effort. That way, I can get the most bang for my buck, so to speak.\n\nLooking through the items, some stand out. For example, \"A87\" has an importance of 1058 for me but requires an effort of 962. That's a high importance but also high effort. Then there's \"B37\" with an importance of 988 and effort of 892. Both are high value but take up a lot of the limit. Similarly, \"B81\" is 992 importance with 896 effort.\n\nOn the flip side, lower effort items like \"C17\" have an effort of just 89 but my importance is only 185. \"A71\" is even lower effort at 12, but importance is 108. \"B15\" is 115 effort for 211 importance. These are smaller, so maybe these can fill in the gaps.\n\nI think I should start by considering the highest importance items and see if they can fit within the limit together. Maybe a combination of the top few. But adding too many of the high-effort items might exceed the 9322 limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a mix of high and medium importance with lower effort could maximize my total. For example, including a couple of high-importance items and then filling the rest with lower effort ones.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the efficiency of each item, which is importance per effort. Let's compute that for a few items. \"A71\" is 108/12 = 9, which is actually very high. \"B15\" is 211/115 \u2248 1.83. \"C17\" is 185/89 \u2248 2.08. \"A87\" is 1058/962 \u2248 1.1. \"B37\" is 988/892 \u2248 1.11. \"B81\" is 992/896 \u2248 1.11.\n\nWait a minute, \"A71\" has the highest efficiency. Maybe including it would be beneficial. But its importance is low, so perhaps it's not as impactful as others. Still, including it might free up space for other items.\n\nI think I should consider starting with the most efficient items, but also consider the total contribution. Maybe a linear approach: sort by efficiency and pick items until the effort max is reached.\n\nLet me try that. Sort all items by importance divided by effort, descending order.\n\nSo, \"A71\" is 9.0, then maybe \"C17\" at 2.08, \"B15\" 1.83, \"C84\" 536/440 = 1.22, \"B96\" 415/319 \u22481.30, \"A94\" 214/118\u22481.81, \"B43\"322/226\u22481.42, \"C53\"396/300=1.32, \"B69\"422/326\u22481.29, \"C72\"600/504\u22481.19, \"A25\"379/283\u22481.34, \"A65\"447/351\u22481.27, \"B23\"959/863\u22481.11, \"A46\"610/514\u22481.19, \"B19\"751/655\u22481.15, \"C60\"755/659\u22481.15, \"A28\"622/526\u22481.18, \"A39\"664/568\u22481.17, \"A88\"717/621\u22481.16, \"C83\"926/830\u22481.12, \"A97\"775/679\u22481.14, \"B64\"715/619\u22481.16, \"A96\"862/766\u22481.12, \"B16\"758/662\u22481.15, \"C79\"694/598\u22481.16, \"B34\"917/821\u22481.12, \"C82\"598/502\u22481.19, \"A08\"476/380\u22481.25, \"A75\"864/768=1.125, \"B95\"544/448\u22481.21.\n\nWow, okay, so \"A71\" is way ahead. Then \"C17\", \"B15\", \"A94\", \"B96\", \"B43\", \"C53\", \"A25\", \"A65\", etc.\n\nSo maybe including \"A71\" is a no-brainer. Then, include as much as possible from the top of this list.\n\nBut I need to see what total effort would be if I take the top items in this sorted list until I hit 9322.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n1. A71: 12, total=12, imp=108\n2. C17:89, total=101, imp=185+108=293\n3. B15:115, total=216, imp=211+293=504\n4. B96:319, total=535, imp=415+504=919\n5. B43:226, total=761, imp=322+919=1241\n6. C53:300, total=1061, imp=396+1241=1637\n7. A94:118, total=1179, imp=214+1637=1851\n8. A25:283, total=1462, imp=379+1851=2230\n9. A08:380, total=1842, imp=476+2230=2706\n10. B95:448, total=2290, imp=544+2706=3250\n11. C60:659, total=2949, imp=755+3250=4005\n12. B19:655, total=3604, imp=751+4005=4756\n13. A65:351, total=3955, imp=447+4756=5203\n14. C82:502, total=4457, imp=598+5203=5801\n15. A46:514, total=4971, imp=610+5801=6411\n16. A28:526, total=5497, imp=622+6411=7033\n17. B64:619, total=6116, imp=715+7033=7748\n18. A39:568, total=6684, imp=664+7748=8412\n19. A88:621, total=7305, imp=717+8412=9129 (Wait, total effort is 7305, which is under 9322)\n20. C83:830, total effort would be 7305+830=8135, imp=926+9129=10055\n21. C10:562, total=8135+562=8697, imp=658+10055=10713\n22. A97:679, total=8697+679=9376, which exceeds 9322. So, can't take A97.\n\nSo, up to C10, we have total effort 8697, and imp=10713.\n\nIs there room for any more items? Let's see the remaining effort: 9322 -8697=625.\n\nLooking at the next items: A97 (679) is too big, so maybe others. Let's see, remaining items not yet included:\n\nB81 (896) too big. B34 (821) too big. B37 (892) too big. C51 (771) too big. A87 (962) too big. So, perhaps some smaller ones. Let me see which items are left.\n\nLooking back, I think I might have missed some. For example, after C10, the remaining items not yet included are B23 (863), B37 (892), C51 (771), B16 (662), C79 (598), B95 is already included. Wait, B95 was included in step 10.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because when I included A97, it exceeded, but maybe I can replace some items to fit more in. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including some of the high-importance items that I skipped earlier could yield a better total. For example, including B37 (imp=988) is a high value. Let's see, if I remove some lower importance items to include B37.\n\nBut this might require careful calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should create a proposal that includes the highest importance items, even if they're high effort, because they contribute significantly to my total.\n\nFor example, including A87 (imp=1058), B37 (988), B81 (992), and B23 (959). These are all over 900 importance each. Although they are high effort, their total might be worth it if the sum is under 9322.\n\nLet's try adding them one by one:\n\nA87:962, total=962, imp=1058\nB37:892, total=1854, imp=988+1058=2046\nB81:896, total=2750, imp=992+2046=3038\nB23:863, total=3613, imp=959+3038=3997\n\nTotal effort is 3613, leaving 9322-3613=5709.\n\nNow, with the remaining 5709, I can add other items. Maybe continue adding the next highest importance items that fit.\n\nLooking at remaining items: C83 (imp=926, effort=830), C51 (867,771), B19 (751,655), etc.\n\nC83:830, total=3613+830=4443, imp=3997+926=4923\nC51:771, total=4443+771=5214, imp=4923+867=5790\nB19:655, total=5214+655=5869, imp=5790+751=6541\n\nRemaining effort:9322-5869=3453.\n\nNext, perhaps A96 (862,766) would fit, since 766 <=3453.\n\nA96:766, total=5869+766=6635, imp=6541+862=7403\n\nRemaining effort:9322-6635=2687.\n\nNext, B16 (758,662). 662 <=2687.\n\nTotal becomes 6635+662=7297, imp=7403+758=8161\n\nRemaining:9322-7297=2025.\n\nNext, C60 (755,659). 659 <=2025.\n\nTotal:7297+659=7956, imp=8161+755=8916\n\nRemaining:9322-7956=1366.\n\nNext, C79 (694,598). 598 <=1366.\n\nTotal:7956+598=8554, imp=8916+694=9610\n\nRemaining:9322-8554=768.\n\nA25 (379,283). 283 <=768.\n\nTotal:8554+283=8837, imp=9610+379=10, 989\n\nRemaining:9322-8837=485.\n\nA08 (476,380). 380 <=485.\n\nTotal:8837+380=9217, imp=10,989+476=11,465\n\nRemaining:9322-9217=105.\n\nNow, can we add anything else? Maybe C17 (89,185) but 89 <=105.\n\nAdding C17: total=9217+89=9306, imp=11,465+185=11,650\n\nRemaining:9322-9306=16. Not enough for any more items.\n\nSo total effort is 9306, which is under 9322, and total importance is 11,650.\n\nThis seems pretty good, but let me check if including more high-importance items earlier might yield a better total. Alternatively, perhaps including A71 (importance 108, effort 12) could help, but in the above, I didn't include it. Hmm, why? Because when I sorted by efficiency, I took A71 first, but in this case, I skipped it to take high-importance items. So which approach is better?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I got imp=11,013 with effort 8697, and then tried to add more. In the second approach, with selecting high-importance items, I got 11,650. But perhaps I can find a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a mix. Start with the highest importance, then fill with high-efficiency. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose I include the top 5 highest importance items: A87 (1058), B37 (988), B81 (992), B23 (959), and C83 (926). Let's see:\n\nA87:962, total=962, imp=1058\nB37:892, total=1854, imp=988+1058=2046\nB81:896, total=2750, imp=992+2046=3038\nB23:863, total=3613, imp=959+3038=3997\nC83:830, total=4443, imp=926+3997=4923\n\nTotal effort=4443, remaining=9322-4443=4879.\n\nNext, add the next highest importance: C51 (867), effort=771.\n\nTotal effort=4443+771=5214, imp=4923+867=5790, remaining=4108.\n\nNext, B19 (751,655).\n\nTotal=5214+655=5869, imp=5790+751=6541, remaining=9322-5869=3453.\n\nNext, A96 (862,766).\n\nTotal=5869+766=6635, imp=6541+862=7403, remaining=2687.\n\nThen B16 (758,662).\n\nTotal=6635+662=7297, imp=7403+758=8161, remaining=2025.\n\nThen C60 (755,659).\n\nTotal=7297+659=7956, imp=8161+755=8916, remaining=1366.\n\nC79 (694,598).\n\nTotal=7956+598=8554, imp=8916+694=9610, remaining=768.\n\nA25 (379,283).\n\nTotal=8554+283=8837, imp=9610+379=10,989, remaining=9322-8837=485.\n\nA08 (476,380).\n\nTotal=8837+380=9217, imp=10,989+476=11,465, remaining=105.\n\nC17 (89,185).\n\nTotal=9217+89=9306, imp=11,465+185=11,650, remaining=16.\n\nSame as before. Now, let's see what happens if I include A71 (12 effort, 108 imp) somewhere. Since in the above selection, I didn't include A71, but perhaps if I can replace a lower importance item with higher efficiency.\n\nLooking at the items included, the last ones were C17 (imp=185) and A25 (379), A08 (476), which have lower importance per effort. Replacing C17 with A71 would save effort but reduce importance by 185-108=77. So total effort would decrease by 89-12=77, so total effort would be 9306-77=9229, and importance 11,650-77=11,573. That's worse because imp decreases more than effort saved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can include A71 earlier, but given that it's small, it might allow adding another higher importance item. But in the above, effort is already 9306, so adding A71 (12) would require removing something. So maybe the initial approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not including C17 and instead including A71 would let me add something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps including more of the higher efficiency items allows me to get more total importance, even if individually their importance isn't as high.\n\nLet me try building a set that maximizes the sum of importance within the effort limit, using a knapsack approach.\n\nThis is a 0-1 knapsack problem, where each item can be included once, with weight=effort and value=importance.\n\nBut since it's a negotiation, I don't have to solve it perfectly, just make a good proposal.\n\nGiven that, I might aim for a set that includes the highest possible importance, considering effort.\n\nIn the initial approach, the total is 11,650 with effort 9306. Is that the maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including B95 (544,448). Let me see if I can include more items without exceeding.\n\nLooking back, after including up to C17, effort is 9306. If I instead include B95 earlier, maybe I can fit more.\n\nAlternatively, in the initial approach, I included A08, which is 380 effort for 476 imp. Maybe I can find a better replacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including B95 instead of A08. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf I don't include A08 (effort 380 saved, imp 476 lost), but include B95 (effort 448, imp 544). So net effort change: 448-380=68 added, imp change:544-476=68 added. So, imp increases by 68, and effort increases by 68. Since 9322 is the limit, if I can manage it, it's better.\n\nSo replacing A08 with B95 would take the effort from 9217 to 9217 -380 +448=9285, imp from 11,465-476+544=11,533.\n\nThat's better. Then, with 9285 effort, remaining=9322-9285=37. Not enough for anything else.\n\nSo total imp=11,533, which is higher than 11,650? Wait, no, 11,533 vs 11,650. Wait, 11,650 is higher. Hmm, so that swap would lower the total. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, in the previous step, after including A08, total imp is 11,465. Then adding C17 gives 11,650. If I replace A08 with B95, I would have:\n\nImp:11,465 -476 +544=11,533. Then add C17:11,533+185=11,718. But that's less than 11,650. So the initial set is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not including A08 and including B95 and C17.\n\nWait, let me try it.\n\nAfter including up to C79, effort=8554, imp=9610.\n\nThen, next items: maybe include B95 (448), A25 (283), A08 (380), etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe the best approach is to include as many high-importance items as possible, even if their effort is high, as long as the total is under the limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is the best I can do without a more optimal selection.\n\nIn any case, I need to propose a set. Given that, I'll consider a proposal that includes the highest importance items, ensuring the total effort is under 9322. So I'll list the items that contribute the most to my importance.\n\nLooking back, the highest importance items are:\n\nA87:1058\nB37:988\nB81:992\nB23:959\nC83:926\nC51:867\nB19:751\nA96:862\nB16:758\nC60:755\nC79:694\nA88:717\nA97:775\nC82:598\nA28:622\nB64:715\nA75:864\nA39:664\nA46:610\nB95:544\nA08:476\nB15:211\nA94:214\nB43:322\nB69:422\nB96:415\nC53:396\nA25:379\nA65:447\nC17:185\nA71:108\n\nSo the top ones are A87, B37, B81, B23, C83, C51, B19, A96, B16, C60, C79, A88, A97, etc.\n\nI need to select a combination that doesn't exceed the effort limit.\n\nLet me attempt a proposal that includes:\n\nA87, B37, B81, B23, C83, C51, B19, A96, B16, C60, C79, A88, A97, A75, A39, A28.\n\nWait, let's calculate the effort:\n\nA87:962\nB37:892\nB81:896\nB23:863\nC83:830\nC51:771\nB19:655\nA96:766\nB16:662\nC60:659\nC79:598\nA88:621\nA97:679\nA75:768\nA39:568\nA28:526\n\nWait, adding these up step by step:\n\n962 +892=1854\n+896=2750\n+863=3613\n+830=4443\n+771=5214\n+655=5869\n+766=6635\n+662=7297\n+659=7956\n+598=8554\n+621=9175\n+679=9854 (Oops, this already exceeds 9322, so I need to stop before.\n\nWait, so up to A88:621, total effort=8554+621=9175.\n\nRemaining effort=9322-9175=147.\n\nSo perhaps adding A75 (768) is too much, but maybe smaller items.\n\nWait, in this case, with 147 left, I can only include items with effort\u2264147.\n\nLooking at remaining items, perhaps A25 (283) is too big, C17 (89), A94 (118), A71 (12), B15 (115).\n\nSo maybe include C17 (89) for imp=185.\n\nTotal effort=9175+89=9264, remaining=58.\n\nThen include A71 (12), total=9264+12=9276, rem=46.\n\nNo more items can fit. So total imp would be:\n\nA87:1058\nB37:988\nB81:992\nB23:959\nC83:926\nC51:867\nB19:751\nA96:862\nB16:758\nC60:755\nC79:694\nA88:717\nC17:185\nA71:108\n\nSum these:\n\n1058+988=2046\n+992=3038\n+959=3997\n+926=4923\n+867=5790\n+751=6541\n+862=7403\n+758=8161\n+755=8916\n+694=9610\n+717=10327\n+185=10512\n+108=10620\n\nTotal importance=10,620. Wait, but this seems lower than the earlier 11,650.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe including more of the high-efficiency items is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different combination that includes some high-efficiency items along with high-importance ones.\n\nBut given time constraints, I think I should make a proposal based on the highest importance items that fit within the limit. So I'll include A87, B37, B81, B23, C83, C51, B19, A96, B16, C60, C79, A88, A75, A39, A28, B64, C82, A08, and see if the total effort is under 9322.\n\nWait, let's calculate step by step:\n\nA87:962\nB37:892 \u2192 1854\nB81:896 \u2192 2750\nB23:863 \u2192 3613\nC83:830 \u2192 4443\nC51:771 \u2192 5214\nB19:655 \u2192 5869\nA96:766 \u2192 6635\nB16:662 \u2192 7297\nC60:659 \u2192 7956\nC79:598 \u2192 8554\nA88:621 \u2192 9175\nNow, remaining=9322-9175=147. Can't add more big items. Maybe A75 is 768, too big. So stop here.\n\nTotal imp: A87=1058, B37=988, B81=992, B23=959, C83=926, C51=867, B19=751, A96=862, B16=758, C60=755, C79=694, A88=717. Let's sum these:\n\n1058+988=2046\n+992=3038\n+959=3997\n+926=4923\n+867=5790\n+751=6541\n+862=7403\n+758=8161\n+755=8916\n+694=9610\n+717=10327.\n\nSo imp=10,327. Effort=9175.\n\nThat's under the limit, but perhaps I can add more.\n\nWait, 9322-9175=147, so maybe include items with effort \u2264147. Like A71 (12, imp=108), A94 (118, imp=214), B15 (115, imp=211), or B43 (226, too big), C17 (89,185).\n\nIncluding A71, A94, B15, C17:\n\nA71:12, total=9175+12=9187, imp=10327+108=10435\nA94:118, total=9187+118=9305, imp=10435+214=10649\nB15:115, total=9305+115=9420 which exceeds. So can't include B15.\n\nC17:89, total=9305+89=9394, which is over. So only include up to A94.\n\nTotal effort=9305, imp=10,649. Remaining=9322-9305=17, which isn't enough.\n\nAlternatively, instead of A94, include C17 first: 9175+89=9264, imp=10327+185=10512. Then include A94:9264+118=9382, over. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include B15:9175+115=9290, imp=10327+211=10538. Then include C17= 9290+89=9379, which is over. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include B15 and C17, but effort would be 115+89=204, making total=9175+204=9379>9322. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include A71, B15, C17: 12+115+89=216, total=9175+216=9391>9322.\n\nSo maybe only A71 and A94: total=9175+12+118=9305, imp=108+214=322, total imp=10327+322=10649.\n\nThat's a good increase. So final set would include up to A88, plus A71 and A94.\n\nSo the proposal would be: {A71, A87, A88, A94, B16, B19, B23, B37, B81, C51, C60, C79, C83}.\n\nWait, let me list all included items:\n\nA71, A87, B37, B81, B23, C83, C51, B19, A96, B16, C60, C79, A88, A94.\n\nWait, but earlier, I included A96 but in this list, it's missing. Let me recount.\n\nWait, I think I included A96 earlier, so maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, the detailed addition steps included A96, B16, etc. So perhaps the full list is:\n\nA71, A87, A88, A94, B16, B19, B23, B37, B81, C51, C60, C79, C83, A96.\n\nBut let's make sure the effort doesn't exceed.\n\nCalculate each item's effort:\n\nA71:12\nA87:962\nA88:621\nA94:118\nB16:662\nB19:655\nB23:863\nB37:892\nB81:896\nC51:771\nC60:659\nC79:598\nC83:830\nA96:766\n\nLet's sum them step by step:\n\nStart with A71:12\n\n+ A87:962 \u2192 974\n\n+ A88:621 \u2192 1595\n\n+ A94:118 \u2192 1713\n\n+ B16:662 \u2192 2375\n\n+ B19:655 \u2192 3030\n\n+ B23:863 \u2192 3893\n\n+ B37:892 \u2192 4785\n\n+ B81:896 \u2192 5681\n\n+ C51:771 \u2192 6452\n\n+ C60:659 \u2192 7111\n\n+ C79:598 \u2192 7709\n\n+ C83:830 \u2192 8539\n\n+ A96:766 \u2192 9305\n\nTotal effort=9305, which is under 9322. Imp=10,649+... Wait, earlier I had imp=10,649 with this set.\n\nSo, the PROPOSAL is the set of these items.\n\nI think that's a good proposal because it includes a mix of high-importance and high-efficiency items, keeping the total effort under the limit.\n"

The other participant has their own importance values, which I don't know, so I have to go purely based on mine. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the items along with both their effort and my importance. This way, I can sort them based on how much each item matters to me relative to the effort it requires. That ratio of importance to effort is crucial because it tells me which items give me the most value without using too much of the effort limit.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll note each item's effort and importance, then calculate the ratio. For example, A71 has an effort of 12 and importance of 108, so the ratio is 9. This seems really efficient. A94 has an effort of 118 and importance of 214, giving a ratio of about 1.81. On the higher end, B81 has an effort of 896 and importance of 992, so the ratio is roughly 1.11.\n\nNow, I should start by selecting items with the highest ratios first. A71 is a must because it uses very little effort for high importance. Then, A87 with a ratio of 1.10 is next because even though the effort is high, the importance is significantly higher. B37 has a ratio of 1.10 as well, so that's a good pick too.\n\nAs I go down the list, I'll add items, keeping track of the total effort to make sure it doesn't go over 9322. But wait, in my initial proposal, I included several high-importance items, but perhaps I missed some that are more efficient. Let me recalculate which items to include without exceeding the limit.\n\nI realize maybe I should prioritize items with the highest importance first, even if their effort is higher. B37, for example, has a very high importance for me, so including it is a priority. Similarly, B81, B23, and C83 are all high-importance items that I can't afford to leave out if possible.\n\nI also notice some lower-effort items like C17 with very low importance, so it's better to exclude those in favor of more impactful items. But wait, perhaps including a few low-effort, moderate-importance items could help stay under the limit while still contributing to the total importance.\n\nIn the initial offer, I may have focused too much on high-importance without considering if the total effort was balanced. Maybe I should adjust by swapping out a high-effort, high-importance item with a couple of mid-range ones to free up effort for more important items elsewhere.\n\nI think my strategic mistake might have been including too many high-effort items without ensuring that the total stays way below the limit. Perhaps scaling back on one or two big ones and including a mix of medium and small ones could provide a better balance and higher total importance.\n\nIn the end, I need to find the optimal mix that maximizes my total importance without exceeding the effort limit, considering the ratios and the other player's likely preferences. I might need to make some concessions and adjustments based on the other participant's responses to reach a mutually acceptable set.\n"

So, the user is in a negotiation game where they need to maximize their own total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 9322. They sent a message that didn't start correctly, so they need to fix that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand their goal. They're trying to work with another participant to agree on a set of items. Each item has an effort value, and the total effort can't exceed 9322. Each player has their own importance scores for the items, which they can't share.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the user attempted a proposal but didn't start with the required STRATEGIC REASONING tag properly. They need to correct that. Their last strategic reasoning was about balancing high-importance and efficient items, and they proposed a specific set.\n\nNow, looking at the initial response, the user's last message still didn't start correctly. So, the system needs to prompt a corrected response that starts with STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by a proposal or another action.\n\nI should make sure that any response starts with the proper tag and follows the interaction protocol strictly. Also, the user needs to include an ARGUMENT at least once, explaining their reasoning without revealing their importance scores.\n\nSo, the corrected message should have STRATEGIC REASONING first, then any other structured message like PROPOSAL or ARGUMENT. The proposal should be a set of items that maximizes the user's total importance within the effort limit.\n\nPerhaps the user's approach is to start by selecting the highest importance items and then filling in with lower effort ones. Alternatively, focusing on items with the best effort-to-importance ratios might be more effective.\n\nI also need to ensure that the response adheres strictly to the given structure to avoid any further issues. Maybe the user should verify the total effort of the proposed items to make sure it's within the limit.\n\nIn the previous proposal, the user included items like 'A71' with very low effort but low importance, and 'A87' with high importance but high effort. It's a mix that might be necessary to stay within the limit while getting high-value items.\n\nThe user also needs to be ready to negotiate and possibly refine their proposal based on the other participant's responses, making sure to argue the benefits of their proposal to persuade the other side.\n\nOverall, the key is to follow the structure correctly, prioritize high-importance items efficiently, and be ready to adjust based on the negotiation flow.\n"
