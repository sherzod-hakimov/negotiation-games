                    "content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nWe have 14 items, each with an effort and importance value. My goal is to negotiate a set of items with the other participant such that the total effort doesn't exceed 3288. The tricky part is that I don't know the other person's importance values, and they don't know mine. But I need to maximize the total importance based on my own values while staying within the effort limit.\n\nFirst, I think it's essential to list out all the items with both effort and my importance. That way, I can see which items give me the most bang for the buck in terms of effort vs. importance. Let me jot them down:\n\nItem | Effort | My Importance\n-----|--------|--------------\nA18 | 118 | 484\nA43 | 417 | 868\nA62 | 887 | 65\nA67 | 75 | 822\nB19 | 808 | 262\nB36 | 350 | 461\nB42 | 390 | 783\nC08 | 329 | 138\nC10 | 129 | 780\nC42 | 801 | 808\nC43 | 151 | 121\nC55 | 41 | 583\nC61 | 630 | 668\nC67 | 602 | 389\nC73 | 849 | 508\n\nHmm, looking at this, I can see that some items have high importance but also high effort, while others are low effort with moderate importance. For example, C55 has the highest importance for me (583) but requires only 41 effort. That seems like a great starting point. Similarly, A67 has high importance (822) and low effort (75), which is also a great candidate.\n\nOn the other hand, A62 has the highest effort (887) but very low importance for me (65). That seems like a bad deal, so I'd probably want to avoid including that unless absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to maximize my total importance without exceeding the effort limit. Since I don't know the other person's priorities, I have to balance between picking high-importance items for myself and considering what the other might want.\n\nMaybe a good strategy is to prioritize items that have high importance for me and low effort. That way, I can include as many high-value items as possible without using up too much effort. Let me try to sort the items based on importance per effort ratio, which might help me identify the most efficient choices.\n\nCalculating importance per effort:\n\nItem | Effort | Importance | Ratio\n-----|--------|------------|-------\nC55 | 41 | 583 | 14.22\nA67 | 75 | 822 | 10.96\nA18 | 118 | 484 | 4.10\nC10 | 129 | 780 | 6.05\nB42 | 390 | 783 | 2.01\nA43 | 417 | 868 | 2.08\nC67 | 602 | 389 | 0.65\nB36 | 350 | 461 | 1.32\nC43 | 151 | 121 | 0.80\nC08 | 329 | 138 | 0.42\nC61 | 630 | 668 | 1.06\nC42 | 801 | 808 | 1.01\nB19 | 808 | 262 | 0.32\nC73 | 849 | 508 | 0.60\nA62 | 887 | 65 | 0.07\n\nWow, C55 and A67 have the highest ratios, so I definitely want to include those first. Next would be C10, A18, A43, and so on.\n\nIf I start adding these up:\n\nC55: 41\nA67: 75 --> Total so far: 116\nC10: 129 --> Total: 245\nA18: 118 --> Total: 363\nA43: 417 --> Total: 780\nB42: 390 --> Total: 1170\nC61: 630 --> Total: 1800\nC42: 801 --> Total: 2601\nC73: 849 --> That's over the limit (2601 + 849 = 3450 > 3288)\n\nSo maybe stop before C73. Let me check the total after C42: 2601. Remaining effort: 3288 - 2601 = 687.\n\nIs there another item I can fit in? Let's see:\n\nC67: 602, but 2601 + 602 = 3203, which is under. So adding that would leave 85 effort left. Are there any small effort items left? C08 is 329, which is too big. C43 is 151, but that's more than the remaining 85. So maybe adding C67 gives me more importance without exceeding.\n\nSo the proposed set so far would be C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C42, C67. Let me check the total effort:\n\n41 +75=116; +129=245; +118=363; +417=780; +390=1170; +630=1800; +801=2601; +602=3203. Hmm, that leaves 85. Since we can't split items, maybe replace something or see if a smaller item can fit, but the only small one left is C08 (329), which is too big.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of C42 (801), which is a high effort, maybe I can swap it with something else to free up space. Let me see: Let's calculate without C42 and see if I can include other items.\n\nIf I remove C42 (801), the total becomes 2601 - 801 = 1800. Then I have 3288 - 1800 = 1488 left.\n\nLooking for items not yet included: C42, C73, B19, A62, C08, C43. Now, what's the best way to use 1488 effort.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to pick items that give me the highest importance without exceeding the limit. But since this is a negotiation, I might need to consider that the other person might have different priorities.\n\nThe other participant is also trying to maximize their own importance, which I don't know. So they might prefer certain items more than others. Therefore, in my proposal, I need to include items that I find valuable and perhaps items they might find valuable to encourage them to agree.\n\nBut since I don't know their priorities, I have to guess based on the effort and the distribution. For example, items with high effort but perhaps high importance for them. Alternatively, they might prefer items that are more moderate in effort but have high importance.\n\nAnother approach is to look for items that have high effort but low importance for me, which the other party might find more valuable. For example, A62 has high effort but low importance for me, so maybe the other person values it highly, so including it could be a bargaining chip.\n\nBut since I want to maximize my own total, I should prioritize my high-importance items. But in a negotiation, sometimes you need to give a little to get what you want.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps propose a set that includes all my high-importance, high-ratio items, and see if the other participant accepts.\n\nBut perhaps they will refuse if the set is too one-sided in my favor. So I need to balance.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a minimal set that gives me the maximum importance, but also includes some items that might be important to them, even if they are not so for me. But without knowing their importance, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start by making a proposal that includes as many of my high-value items as possible, and see how the other responds.\n\nSo, perhaps my first proposal is to include C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C42. Let's see the total effort:\n\nC55:41, A67:75, C10:129, A18:118, A43:417, B42:390, C61:630, C42:801.\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n41+75=116\n\n116+129=245\n\n245+118=363\n\n363+417=780\n\n780+390=1170\n\n1170+630=1800\n\n1800+801=2601.\n\nTotal effort:2601. That leaves 3288-2601=687.\n\nI could try to include C67 (602) in this proposal, which would bring the total to 2601+602=3203, leaving 85. Alternatively, since 85 is small, perhaps there's an item with effort less than that, but looking back, the remaining items are: C08(329), C43(151), B19(808), A62(887), C73(849). None of these fit into 85, so maybe the proposal is just the initial 8 items.\n\nBut perhaps even better to include as many as possible without exceeding. Alternatively, try to include C67 and one more small item, but since there are none, maybe just the 8 items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swap out some items to include more of my high-importance without exceeding.\n\nWait, 2601 effort used, 687 remaining. Could I swap out an item with lower importance for me but uses a lot of effort, and instead include two items with higher or similar importance and lower effort?\n\nLet me think. For example, C42 uses 801 effort and gives me 808 importance. If I remove C42, I gain 801 effort back, which would allow me to add 801 worth of other items.\n\nLooking for items with total effort ~800. Let's see, maybe C73 (849) is too big. C61 is already included. C67 is 602. So 602 + something else? 602 + C43 (151) would be 753, which is under 801. So maybe replace C42 with C67 and C43.\n\nLet me see: replacing C42 (801) with C67 (602) and C43 (151). So the effort would decrease by 801 and increase by 602+151=753, so net decrease of 48. So total effort would be 2601 - 801 + 753 = 2553. That leaves more room: 3288 -2553=735.\n\nBut do I gain anything? C42 gives me 808, while C67 and C43 give me 389 +121=510. So I lose 298 in importance. That's a bad trade. So probably not a good idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe find a way to include more high-importance items without overstepping.\n\nAnother idea: Let's see what the maximum possible importance I can get if I include the top items. Let me try to include the top 5:\n\nC55(583), A67(822), C10(780), A18(484), A43(868). Total effort:41+75+129+118+417= 780. That leaves 3288-780=2508 left. With that much, I can include several more items. Maybe B42(390), C61(630), and C42(801). Let's add them:\n\n780+390=1170; +630=1800; +801=2601. Again, same as before. So maybe after that, include C67(602), totaling 3203, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a combination that uses the effort more efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of B42 (390) and C42 (801), which together use 1191 effort, maybe I can include C73 (849), but that would leave 390. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include C73 instead of C42. C73 gives me 508 importance with 849 effort, whereas C42 gives me 808 with 801 effort. So C42 is better for me. So better to stick with C42.\n\nSo, the initial proposal seems to be a good set for me. But since this is a negotiation, I need to think about what the other person might want. They might have high importance for some items I don't care much about, so including those could make them more willing to accept.\n\nLooking at the items, A62 has high effort but low importance for me. Maybe the other participant values it highly, so including it could be beneficial. But would that be worth it? Let's see: including A62 would cost 887 effort. I would have to remove other items to compensate.\n\nIf I include A62, I might have to remove some of my high-importance items, which might not be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other participant might value B19 highly. B19 has 808 effort and 262 importance for me. If they have high importance for it, including it could be beneficial, but I don't know.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to make an initial proposal with my high-importance items and see if they accept or refuse. If they refuse, I can adjust accordingly.\n\nSo, my initial PROPOSAL would include: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, and C42. That totals 2601 effort, leaving 687 unused. It's a solid set for me, but maybe I can try to add C67 as well, making the effort 3203, which is still under the limit.\n\nSo the proposed items would be: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C42, C67. Let me check the effort:\n\n41 (C55) +75 (A67) =116\n\n+129 (C10)=245\n\n+118 (A18)=363\n\n+417 (A43)=780\n\n+390 (B42)=1170\n\n+630 (C61)=1800\n\n+801 (C42)=2601\n\n+602 (C67)=3203.\n\nYes, that's within the limit. Now, the total importance I get from this set:\n\nC55:583, A67:822, C10:780, A18:484, A43:868, B42:783, C61:668, C42:808, C67:389.\n\nLet me sum these up:\n\n583 +822 =1405\n\n+780=2185\n\n+484=2669\n\n+868=3537\n\n+783=4320\n\n+668=4988\n\n+808=5796\n\n+389=6185.\n\nThat's a total of 6185 importance for me.\n\nIs there a way to get higher? Let's see if I can swap out lower-importance items for me but that have high effort, and include higher-importance items that use the saved effort.\n\nFor example, C67 has 602 effort and 389 importance. Maybe I can remove it and include other items that give me more.\n\nWait, if I remove C67 (602 effort), I could use that 602 to include, say, C73 (849) which is too big, or C08 (329) and C43 (151), which total 480. But 602 -480=122, which isn't enough for another item. So including C08 and C43 would only add 329+151=480, but I lose 389 importance and gain 138+121=259. That's a net loss of 130 in importance. Not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove C67 and add nothing, I save 602 effort, but 6185 becomes 6185-389=5796, which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should include C67 because it's better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to include more items that give me higher importance without exceeding effort?\n\nWait, C55 is a must. A67 too. Then, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C42, and C67 seem to be the best I can do. So I think this is a solid proposal.\n\nNow, I need to think about how the other participant might react. They might have high importance for items like A62, B19, or C73. If they do, they might refuse this proposal because it doesn't include those. Therefore, I might need to adjust by including some of their potential high-value items, even if they are low for me.\n\nBut since I don't know their priorities, it's hard to say. So perhaps in the first move, I should propose this set, see their response, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can include some items that I think they might value. Let me try to guess. For example, A62 has high effort, so maybe the other participant has high importance for it. If I include A62 in the proposal, I'd have to remove other items. Let's see how that would affect the total.\n\nIncluding A62 (887) would require removing other items. Let's say I remove C42 (801) and C67 (602) to fit A62. So effort saved: 801+602=1403; adding A62:887, so net saved effort:1403-887=516. That leaves me with 516 extra effort. So I could use that to include more items.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps including A62 and adjusting other items.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to start with my optimal set and see.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I should propose the set that includes C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C42, and C67. This maximizes my total importance while staying under the effort limit. If the other participant refuses, I can try to adjust by including some items they might find valuable, like A62 or B19, in exchange for removing some items that are less important to me.\n"

                    "content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I have a set of items, each with an effort value and an importance value specific to me. The other player has their own importance values which I don't know. The goal is to agree on a set of items where the total effort doesn't exceed 3288. My objective is to maximize my total importance from the selected items.\n\nI remember the user previously tried to send a proposal but made a mistake with the tags. I need to ensure that in my response, the first structured format is always STRATEGIC REASONING, and it must be at the very beginning. Any other formats like PROPOSAL, REFUSE, etc., should follow after that. So, I should correct that by starting with the proper tag.\n\nNow, looking at the items, I need to calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each to prioritize them. Items with higher ratios should be chosen first since they give more importance per unit of effort, which is efficient. Let me list out each item with its importance and effort:\n\n- C08: Importance 138, Effort 329 \u2192 Ratio ~0.42\n- C55: 583/41 \u224814.22\n- A43: 868/417 \u22482.08\n- A67: 822/75 \u224810.96\n- B42: 783/390 \u22482.01\n- A62: 65/887 \u22480.073\n- B19: 262/808 \u22480.324\n- C43: 121/151 \u22480.80\n- C73: 508/849 \u22480.598\n- C10: 780/129 \u22486.05\n- B36: 461/350 \u22481.32\n- A18: 484/118 \u22484.10\n- C61: 668/630 \u22481.06\n- C67: 389/602 \u22480.646\n- C42: 808/801 \u22481.009\n\nSorting these ratios from highest to lowest gives the priority order: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C43, C73, B36, C67, B19, C08, A62, C42.\n\nNow, I need to select items starting from the top until the total effort is just below or equal to 3288. Let's try adding them one by one:\n\n1. C55: 41\n2. A67: 75 \u2192 Total 116\n3. C10: 129 \u2192 245\n4. A18: 118 \u2192 363\n5. A43: 417 \u2192 780\n6. B42: 390 \u2192 1170\n7. C61: 630 \u2192 1800\n8. C43: 151 \u2192 1951\n9. C73: 849 \u2192 Total would be 2800. 2800 is less than 3288, so let's include it: Total = 1951 + 849 = 2800\n10. B36: 350 \u2192 2800 + 350 = 3150. Still under, so include.\n11. C67: 602 \u2192 3150 + 602 = 3752, which is over the limit. So, can't include C67.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total effort so far without C67:\n\nTotal after including B36: 3150, remaining effort 138.\n\nAre there any items left with effort \u2264138? Let's see:\n\nC08: 329 \u2192 No\nC42: 801 \u2192 No\nA62: 887 \u2192 No\nB19: 808 \u2192 No\n\nSo, can't add anything else. The items selected are: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C43, C73, B36.\n\nWait, that's 10 items. Let me add up their efforts:\n\n41 + 75 = 116\n116 + 129 = 245\n245 + 118 = 363\n363 + 417 = 780\n780 + 390 = 1170\n1170 + 630 = 1800\n1800 + 151 = 1951\n1951 + 849 = 2800\n2800 + 350 = 3150\n\nTotal effort is 3150, which is under 3288. So, this selection is valid.\n\nBut wait, can we swap some items to get higher importance? Maybe. Let's see if replacing lower importance per effort items with others could help. For example, B36 has a ratio of 1.32, and C67 has a ratio of 0.646, but C67 uses more effort. Maybe I can replace some lower ratio items from the current set with another combination.\n\nWait, looking at the current set, B36 is in the set. Is there an item after B36 in the priority list that could be added if we remove others? The next item is C67, but its ratio is lower, so it's probably not worth it. Alternatively, is there a way to include a higher ratio item that's not yet in the set?\n\nWait, the priority list has C08, which has a lower ratio but perhaps higher importance. No, I think the priority list is correct, with the highest ratios first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include C42 if we remove some lower ratio items. Let's see: C42 has an importance of 808 and effort 801, ratio ~1.009.\n\nIn the current set, the last few items added are C73 and B36. C73 has importance 508 over effort 849 (ratio ~0.598), and B36 is 461/350 (~1.32). So, if we remove C73 (849 effort, 508 importance) and B36 (350 effort, 461 importance), their total effort is 849 + 350 = 1199, and their total importance is 508 + 461 = 969.\n\nIs there another combination that could fit into 1199 effort with higher importance? Let's see:\n\nLooking for items not selected with high importance that can fit into 1199.\n\nC42: 801 effort, 808 importance. If we include C42 (801), then we have 1199 - 801 = 398 effort left.\n\nAre there any items with effort \u2264398 that we haven't selected? Yes, C08 (329) is available. Including C08 would give us additional 329 effort, total 1129, under 1199.\n\nSo, including C42 and C08: C42 (801) + C08 (329) = 1130, which is within 1199.\n\nNow, the importance of C42 is 808 and C08 is 138, totaling 946, compared to the previous 969.\n\nSo, 969 vs. 946: Lower, so not better.\n\nAlternatively, are there other combinations? Let's see:\n\nAnother item is C67 (602), which is effort 602, with importance 389. Then, remaining effort is 1199 - 602 = 597. Any other items? A62 is 887, too big. C43 is 151, but is already in the set. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nSo, including C42 and C08 gives us less importance than C73 and B36. Therefore, the current set is better.\n\nIs there another way to include C42? Maybe by removing B42 (390 effort, 783 importance) and adding C42 (801) and some other items.\n\nRemoving B42: 390 effort, 783 importance. Adding C42: 801, 808. But 801 is larger than 390, so the effort increases, and importance increases by 25 (808 - 783). But then the total effort would go from 3150 to 3150 - 390 + 801 = 3561, which is over the limit.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replacing multiple items. Let's see, what if I remove B36 (350) and C73 (849) for a total of 1199 effort, can I add higher importance items?\n\nC42 and C08 as before: 1130 effort, giving 808+138=946 importance. Less than 508+461=969. So, worse.\n\nAlternatively, any higher importance items outside the current set? C42 is the only one left with high importance, I think.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps including C42 instead of some lower importance items in the current set, but is it possible without exceeding effort?\n\nFor instance, replace C73 (849) and B36 (350) with C42 (801) and C08 (329). As we saw, that's worse in terms of importance.\n\nAlternatively, replace B36 and C43 (151) with other items? Let's see, 350 +151 = 501. Can I get 501 effort to get more importance? Maybe, but I don't see any items outside that can add higher importance without exceeding effort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace B36 (350) alone with another item. Let's see, 350 effort available. What's the highest importance item not selected that's \u2264350 effort? C08 (329, 138). That's the only one, which is low. So, not helpful.\n\nSo, perhaps the current set is the best I can get without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nAnother approach: Check if adding C42 (801) can be compensated by removing lower ratio items.\n\nWait, in the current set, the items with the lowest ratios are C73 (0.598) and C43 (0.80), and B36 (1.32). If I remove C43 (151) and C73 (849), which total 1000 effort and 508+121=629 importance, and replace them with C42 (801, 808). Then, the effort would be 3150 - 1000 + 801 = 2951, which leaves 3288 - 2951 = 337 effort remaining. With that, I can add C08 (329), which has importance 138. So, total importance would be 3150's total minus 629 plus 808 +138. Wait, original total importance needs to be calculated first.\n\nWait, original total importance is the sum of the current set. Let's calculate that.\n\nCurrent set: C55 (583), A67 (822), C10 (780), A18 (484), A43 (868), B42 (783), C61 (668), C43 (121), C73 (508), B36 (461).\n\nAdding these up:\n\n583 + 822 = 1405\n1405 + 780 = 2185\n2185 + 484 = 2669\n2669 + 868 = 3537\n3537 + 783 = 4320\n4320 + 668 = 4988\n4988 + 121 = 5109\n5109 + 508 = 5617\n5617 + 461 = 6078\n\nSo total importance is 6078.\n\nIf I remove C43 (121) and C73 (508), and add C42 (808) and C08 (138), the total importance becomes:\n\n6078 - 121 - 508 + 808 +138 = 6078 - 629 + 946 = 6078 - 629 is 5449; 5449 + 946 = 6395.\n\nWait, that's actually higher! But wait, can we do that without exceeding effort?\n\nOriginal effort: 3150.\n\nAfter removal: 3150 - 151 (C43) - 849 (C73) = 3150 - 1000 = 2150.\n\nAdding C42 (801) and C08 (329): 801 + 329 = 1130.\n\nTotal effort: 2150 + 1130 = 3280, which is under 3288.\n\nSo, effort is 3280, which is acceptable. Importance increases by 317 (6395 -6078). So, this seems better.\n\nWait, but does this set include all the items? Let me check which items are in:\n\nOriginal set minus C43 and C73, plus C42 and C08. So, the new set would be: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, B36, C42, C08.\n\nWait, does this include B36? Yes. So, the new effort is 3280, and importance is 6395. That's better.\n\nIs this feasible? Let me check if all items are included correctly.\n\nYes, and the effort is under the limit.\n\nSo, perhaps I can make a new proposal with this set.\n\nAlternatively, check if more optimizations are possible.\n\nWait, another idea: Is there a way to include C42 (801) and keep C73 (849)? Let's see, total effort would be 801 +849=1650. In the current set, total effort is 3150, so if I remove other items to make space.\n\nBut this might complicate things, as I'd have to balance which items to remove to make room for both C42 and C73. It's getting a bit complicated, but perhaps it's worth considering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to include C42 and C08 as the previous idea.\n\nSo, the new set would be: C55, A67, C10, A18, A43, B42, C61, C42, C08, B36.\n\nWait, no, because I removed C43 and C73 to add C42 and C08, so B36 is still there.\n\nSo, the set is {'C55', 'A67', 'C10', 'A18', 'A43', 'B42', 'C61', 'C42', 'C08', 'B36'}.\n\nWait, let me check the effort:\n\nC55:41 + A67:75 =116\nC10:129 \u2192245\nA18:118 \u2192363\nA43:417 \u2192780\nB42:390 \u21921170\nC61:630 \u21921800\nC42:801 \u21922601\nC08:329 \u21922930\nB36:350 \u21923280.\n\nYes, total effort is 3280.\n\nImportance: as calculated before, 6395.\n\nSo, is this a better set? Yes, because it includes C42 which has high importance, and replaces C43 and C73 which have lower combined importance.\n\nTherefore, this seems like a better proposal.\n\nWait, but the user's previous proposal included C43 and C73. So, perhaps I can make a counter-proposal.\n\nBut in the initial move, the user didn't have that yet. Wait, in the initial move, the user proposed a set, but it wasn't properly formatted. So, perhaps I'm starting fresh.\n\nIn any case, to maximize my own importance, the new set with 3280 effort and 6395 importance is better.\n\nBut is this the best possible? Let me check if I can include any other items.\n\nLet me see the items not included: C43, C73, C67, C08, B19, A62, C42 is included now.\n\nWait, no, in the new set, C08 is included, so remaining items are C43, C73, C67, B19, A62.\n\nBut in the new set, we included C08, so the remaining items not included are C43, C73, C67, B19, A62.\n\nIs there any way to include any of these with higher importance without exceeding effort?\n\nA62 has high effort, so probably not. B19 has 262 importance but 808 effort, which is too high.\n\nSo, no, I think the new set is the best I can come up with.\n\nTherefore, I should propose this set.\n"
