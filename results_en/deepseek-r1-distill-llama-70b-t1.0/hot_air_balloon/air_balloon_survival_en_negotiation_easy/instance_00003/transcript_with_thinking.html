        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 3712<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;C08&quot;: 949, &quot;C55&quot;: 388, &quot;A43&quot;: 79, &quot;A67&quot;: 585, &quot;B42&quot;: 564, &quot;A62&quot;: 230, &quot;B19&quot;: 580, &quot;C43&quot;: 84, &quot;C73&quot;: 976, &quot;C10&quot;: 274, &quot;B36&quot;: 374, &quot;A18&quot;: 913, &quot;C61&quot;: 303, &quot;C67&quot;: 578, &quot;C42&quot;: 548}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;C08&quot;: 138, &quot;C55&quot;: 583, &quot;A43&quot;: 868, &quot;A67&quot;: 822, &quot;B42&quot;: 783, &quot;A62&quot;: 65, &quot;B19&quot;: 262, &quot;C43&quot;: 121, &quot;C73&quot;: 508, &quot;C10&quot;: 780, &quot;B36&quot;: 461, &quot;A18&quot;: 484, &quot;C61&quot;: 668, &quot;C67&quot;: 389, &quot;C42&quot;: 808}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!<br/><br/>Interaction Protocol:<br/><br/>You may only use the following structured formats in a message:<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Propose keeping exactly those items.<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Explicitly reject opponent&#x27;s proposal.<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;...&#x27;}<br/>Defend your last proposal or argue against the player&#x27;s proposal.<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Accept the opponent&#x27;s proposal which ends the game.<br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;...&#x27;}<br/>	Describe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>You may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>You may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>Total effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.<br/>Do NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.<br/>A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to negotiate this set of items where each has an effort and importance. My goal is to maximize my total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 3712. I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, which makes it tricky. I need to balance between including items that are highly important to me and those that don&#x27;t consume too much effort.<br/><br/>First, I should probably figure out which items give me the most importance per unit of effort. That way, I can prioritize them. Let&#x27;s calculate the importance divided by effort for each item:<br/><br/>- A43: 868/79 ≈ 11.0<br/>- C55: 583/388 ≈ 1.5<br/>- A67: 822/585 ≈ 1.4<br/>- B42: 783/564 ≈ 1.4<br/>- C10: 780/274 ≈ 2.84<br/>- C08: 138/949 ≈ 0.145<br/>- B19: 262/580 ≈ 0.452<br/>- C43: 121/84 ≈ 1.44<br/>- C73: 508/976 ≈ 0.52<br/>- B36: 461/374 ≈ 1.23<br/>- A18: 484/913 ≈ 0.53<br/>- C61: 668/303 ≈ 2.20<br/>- C67: 389/578 ≈ 0.67<br/>- C42: 808/548 ≈ 1.47<br/>- A62: 65/230 ≈ 0.28<br/><br/>Looking at these, A43 has the highest ratio, followed by C10, C61, C55, A67, B42, and so on. So maybe I should prioritize A43, C10, C61 early on.<br/><br/>Let me try including A43, which is 79 effort. Then C10 at 274, total so far 353. C61 is 303, which brings it to 656. Next, adding C55 (388) would make total 1044. Then A67 (585), total 1629. B42 (564) would bring it to 2193. B36 is 374, total 2567. Next, maybe C42 at 548 gives 3115, which is under 3712. Then C67 (578) would push it to 3693, leaving 19 effort left, which isn&#x27;t enough for anything else. So that&#x27;s 8 items.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. Let me check the total importance:<br/><br/>A43:868 + C10:780 + C61:668 + C55:583 + A67:822 + B42:783 + B36:461 + C42:808 + C67:389. Let me calculate that:<br/><br/>868+780=1648; +668=2316; +583=2900 (Wait, 1648+668=2316? No, 1648+668=2316? Wait 1600+600=2200, 48+68=116, so 2316. Then +583=2899? Wait 2316+500=2816, +83=2899. Then +822=3721. Then +783=4504? Wait, no, wait I think I messed up. Wait each step:<br/><br/>Start: 0.<br/><br/>+ A43:868 → 868.<br/><br/>+ C10:780 → 868+780=1648.<br/><br/>+ C61:668 → 1648+668=2316.<br/><br/>+ C55:583 → 2316+583=2899.<br/><br/>+ A67:822 → 2899+822=3721.<br/><br/>+ B42:783 → 3721+783=4504.<br/><br/>+ B36:461 → 4504+461=4965.<br/><br/>+ C42:808 → 4965+808=5773.<br/><br/>+ C67:389 → 5773+389=6162.<br/><br/>Wait, but that&#x27;s way over the effort limit. Wait, the total effort in my initial plan would be:<br/><br/>A43 (79) + C10 (274) = 353.<br/><br/>+ C61 (303) → 656.<br/><br/>+ C55 (388) → 1044.<br/><br/>+ A67 (585) → 1629.<br/><br/>+ B42 (564) → 2193.<br/><br/>+ B36 (374) → 2567.<br/><br/>+ C42 (548) → 3115.<br/><br/>+ C67 (578) → 3693.<br/><br/>Total effort is 3693, which is under 3712, so I have 19 left, but no items left to add.<br/><br/>But maybe I can swap some items to get higher total importance. Let me see if there are higher importance items that I&#x27;m not including yet.<br/><br/>Looking at my current total importance: 6162 as per above, but that can&#x27;t be right because 868+780 is already 1648, so adding more must be correct. Wait, no, perhaps I should verify the math again.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total importance correctly:<br/><br/>A43:868<br/><br/>C10:780 → 868+780=1648<br/><br/>C61:668 → 1648+668=2316<br/><br/>C55:583 → 2316+583=2899<br/><br/>A67:822 → 2899+822=3721<br/><br/>B42:783 → 3721+783=4504<br/><br/>B36:461 → 4504+461=4965<br/><br/>C42:808 → 4965+808=5773<br/><br/>C67:389 → 5773+389=6162.<br/><br/>So total importance is 6162, effort 3693, under 3712.<br/><br/>Is there a way to include higher importance items? Maybe using the remaining 19 effort, but I don&#x27;t think any item&#x27;s effort is less than that, except maybe C43 (84), but that&#x27;s higher than 19, so no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing some items with higher total importance. Let me see the next best items to include.<br/><br/>Wait, what about C08:138, but it&#x27;s low importance. Maybe not worth it. Alternatively, is there a way to include A18? It&#x27;s effort is 913, which is quite high.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps by swapping some lower importance per effort items with higher ones.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps instead of including both B36 and C42, maybe swapping one of them for another higher importance item.<br/><br/>Looking back at the list, perhaps I can see which items are not included and calculate their ratios.<br/><br/>Other items:<br/><br/>C73:508/976 ≈ 0.52.<br/><br/>A18:484/913≈0.53.<br/><br/>C08:138/949≈0.145.<br/><br/>B19:262/580≈0.452.<br/><br/>C43:121/84≈1.44.<br/><br/>So the next best is C43 with 1.44. Let me see if I can include it.<br/><br/>If I remove B36 (374 effort, importance 461) and add C43 (84), but that&#x27;s a net change of -290 effort, so I can add more.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe swapping B36 for C43. Since B36 is 374 effort and 461 importance, and C43 is 84 effort and 121 importance, the difference is that B36 brings more importance but uses more effort.<br/><br/>But maybe swapping B36 for someone else.<br/><br/>Wait, I think I&#x27;m getting confused. Maybe it&#x27;s better to consider a different approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, considering that A43, C10, C61, C55, A67, B42, C42, C67 are in the set, with 3693 effort. Maybe I can see if adding C43 (84) would exceed the limit. 3693 +84=3777, which is over 3712. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps replacing some items in the current set with others to reduce effort and add more small items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on including the highest importance items first, regardless of effort.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s list items by my importance, descending:<br/><br/>A43:868<br/><br/>C10:780<br/><br/>A67:822 - Oh, wait, A67 is 822, which is higher than C10 (780). So I should have included A67 earlier. Maybe I miscalculated the order.<br/><br/>Wait, let me correct the priority:<br/><br/>High importance:<br/><br/>A43:868<br/><br/>A67:822<br/><br/>C10:780<br/><br/>C61:668<br/><br/>C55:583<br/><br/>C42:808? Wait, no, C42 is 808? Wait no, in the initial list, I have A43, then C10, then C61, but I think I need to recast the order.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps starting over, listing the items in order of my importance:<br/><br/>From highest to lowest:<br/><br/>A43:868<br/><br/>C10:780<br/><br/>A67:822<br/><br/>C61:668<br/><br/>C55:583<br/><br/>C42:808<br/><br/>Wait, no, wait, C42 has importance 808, which is higher than C55&#x27;s 583.<br/><br/>Wait I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all items by my importance:<br/><br/>1. A43:868<br/><br/>2. A67:822<br/><br/>3. C10:780<br/><br/>4. C42:808 (Wait, no, 808 is higher than 780)<br/><br/>Wait, 808 is higher than 780, so order is:<br/><br/>1. A43:868<br/><br/>2. C42:808<br/><br/>3. A67:822 (No, 822 &lt;808? No, 822&gt;808, so A67 is 3rd.<br/><br/>Wait, no, 822 is higher than 808, so actually:<br/><br/>1. A43:868<br/><br/>2. A67:822<br/><br/>3. C42:808<br/><br/>4. C10:780<br/><br/>5. C61:668<br/><br/>6. C55:583<br/><br/>Wait, no, let me make a proper list:<br/><br/>- A43:868 (1)<br/>- C42:808 (2)<br/>- A67:822 (3) → No, 822 is higher than 808, so A67 is 2, C42 is 3.<br/>- C10:780 (4)<br/>- C61:668 (5)<br/>- C55:583 (6)<br/>- B42:783 (7) → Wait, B42&#x27;s importance is 783, which is higher than C55&#x27;s 583. So it&#x27;s 7th after C61 and before C55? No, wait, 783 is higher than 668, so it&#x27;s between C61 and C55.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should create a sorted list properly:<br/><br/>Let me sort all items by their importance in descending order:<br/><br/>1. A43:868<br/><br/>2. A67:822<br/><br/>3. C42:808<br/><br/>4. C10:780<br/><br/>5. B42:783<br/><br/>6. C61:668<br/><br/>7. C55:583<br/><br/>8. B36:461<br/><br/>9. C67:389<br/><br/>10. C73:508<br/><br/>11. A18:484<br/><br/>12. B19:262<br/><br/>13. C08:138<br/><br/>14. A62:65<br/><br/>15. C43:121<br/><br/>Wait, but 508 is higher than 484, so C73 (508) should come before A18 (484). Similarly, 389 (C67) comes after C73 but before A18?<br/><br/>Wait, let me list in the correct order:<br/><br/>Ranking:<br/><br/>1. A43:868<br/><br/>2. A67:822<br/><br/>3. C42:808<br/><br/>4. C10:780<br/><br/>5. B42:783<br/><br/>6. C61:668<br/><br/>7. C55:583<br/><br/>8. C73:508<br/><br/>9. A18:484<br/><br/>10. B36:461<br/><br/>11. C67:389<br/><br/>12. C43:121<br/><br/>13. B19:262<br/><br/>14. C08:138<br/><br/>15. A62:65<br/><br/>Wait, that makes more sense.<br/><br/>Now, considering effort constraints, perhaps I should include as many high-importance items as possible without exceeding the limit.<br/><br/>Start adding items until we reach the limit:<br/><br/>Start with A43 (868 imp, 79 e).<br/><br/>Then add A67 (822 imp, 585 e). Total e:664. Total imp:868+822=1690.<br/><br/>Next, C42 (808, 548 e). Total e:664+548=1212. Imp:1690+808=2498.<br/><br/>Next, C10 (780, 274 e). Total e:1212+274=1486. Imp:2498+780=3278.<br/><br/>Next, B42 (783, 564 e). Total e:1486+564=2050. Imp:3278+783=4061.<br/><br/>Next, C61 (668, 303 e). Total e:2050+303=2353. Imp:4061+668=4729.<br/><br/>Next, C55 (583, 388 e). Total e:2353+388=2741. Imp:4729+583=5312.<br/><br/>Total effort so far:2741. Remaining:3712-2741=971.<br/><br/>Next, C73 (508, 976 e). Since 976 &gt; 971, can&#x27;t add it.<br/><br/>Next, A18 (484,913 e). 913 &gt; 971? 971-913=58, so no, can&#x27;t add.<br/><br/>Next, B36 (461, 374 e). Add B36: e=2741+374=3115. Imp=5312+461=5773.<br/><br/>Remaining:3712-3115=597.<br/><br/>Next, C67 (389,578 e). Add: e=3115+578=3693. Imp:5773+389=6162.<br/><br/>Remaining:3712-3693=19. Nothing else can be added.<br/><br/>Total items: A43, A67, C42, C10, B42, C61, C55, B36, C67. Total e=3693, imp=6162.<br/><br/>Is this optimal? Let me check if replacing some items can get more importance.<br/><br/>Suppose I swap B36 (461, 374 e) with a higher importance item that uses less effort.<br/><br/>But in the sorted list, after B36 is C67, then C43, etc.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe including C73 (508,976 e) is too much effort, but maybe replacing some items.<br/><br/>If I replace C55 (583 imp, 388 e) and B36 (461 imp, 374 e) with C73 (508 imp,976 e), but 976 e is more than 388+374=762, so that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps replacing B36 with C43 (121 imp,84 e). That frees up 374-84=290 e. Then I can add someone else, but the next would be C73 (976), which is too big. Or maybe adding C43 and then seeing if any other items can fit, but probably not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe swapping C55 (583) with C73 (508) is a loss in importance, so not good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including A18 (484,913 e) instead of some items. But 913 e is high. If I remove A18 and include others, but that would require recalculating.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can see if there&#x27;s a higher total by selecting a different combination.<br/><br/>Wait, let me try a different approach: a knapsack approach, selecting items with highest importance per unit effort, but in a way that totals as much as possible.<br/><br/>But considering that, perhaps including high importance items even with higher effort may yield higher total importance.<br/><br/>So perhaps including A67 (585 e), A43 (79), A67 is high importance but also high effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including C10 and C61 early as they have high importance per effort.<br/><br/>Wait, in my first approach, I included 9 items with total imp 6162, effort 3693.<br/><br/>Let me consider another combination to see if imp can be higher.<br/><br/>If I drop B36 (374 e, 461 imp) and add C43 (84 e,121 imp). Then total e reduces by 374-84=290, freeing up e=290. With this, e becomes 3693-374=3319, plus 84 is 3403 (but actually, I think I&#x27;m getting confused. Wait, in the previous set, total e is 3693. If I remove B36 (374) and add C43 (84), the new total e would be 3693-374+84=3403. Then I have 3712-3403=309 left. Can I add something else? C73 is 976, too big. C08 is 949, too big. B19 (580) is too big. No, nothing fits.<br/><br/>But the imp would decrease by 461-121=340, so imp becomes 6162-461+121=5822? No, wait, 6162-341=5821. So that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps dropping C55 (583 imp) and replacing it with someone else. If I don&#x27;t take C55, I have 388 e available. Maybe use that for multiple smaller items. But C43 (84), then maybe also C08 (949) is too big.<br/><br/>No, 388-84=304, still not enough for anything above 304. So no improvement.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including B19 (580 e, 262 imp). But that e is high. Including it would require dropping some items. Let me see: if I remove B36 (374 e,461 imp) and include B19 (580 e,262 imp). Then e change is 580-374=206, so total e would be 3693+206=3899 which exceeds limit. Not good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including A18 (913 e,484 imp). But it&#x27;s too big.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including A62 (230 e,65 imp). But low imp. Not worth.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including C08 (949 e,138 imp). No, too much e.<br/><br/>So perhaps the initial selection is the best.<br/><br/>So the initial proposal includes: A43, A67, C42, C10, B42, C61, C55, B36, C67.<br/><br/>Total effort 3693, imp 6162.<br/><br/>Let me check if there&#x27;s a way to include C73 (976 e,508 imp). If I include it, I need to remove items whose total e is 976. Let me see which items to remove. Maybe removing C10 (274) and B42 (564), totaling 838 e. Then add C73 (976), so net e change: 976-838=138. So total e becomes 3693+138=3831, which is over the limit. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, removing B36 (374) and C55 (388), totaling 762 e, and adding C73 (976 e). 976-762=214, so e becomes 3693+214=3907, over. No good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, removing C67 (578) and adding C73 (976). 976-578=398, e becomes 3693+398=4091, over.<br/><br/>No good. So maybe C73 can&#x27;t be included without overshooting.<br/><br/>So I think my initial set is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Therefore, I&#x27;ll propose this set.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, I need to respond correctly to the user&#x27;s message. The user provided a negotiation game scenario where two players have to agree on a set of items without exceeding a certain effort limit. In my previous response, I didn&#x27;t follow the correct structure by starting with the strategic reasoning tag. Now, I need to make sure I adhere to the interaction protocol.<br/><br/>First, looking at the items and their efforts and importances. My goal is to maximize my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 3712. I should prioritize items with higher importance and manageable effort.<br/><br/>I should list all the items with their effort and importance to me:<br/><br/>- A43: importance 868, effort 79<br/>- A67: 822, 585<br/>- C42: 808, 548<br/>- C10: 780, 274<br/>- C55: 583, 388<br/>- C61: 668, 303<br/>- B42: 783, 564<br/>- B36: 461, 374<br/>- C67: 389, 578<br/>- C08: 138, 949<br/>- B19: 262, 580<br/>- C43: 121, 84<br/>- A62: 65, 230<br/>- A18: 484, 913<br/>- C73: 508, 976<br/><br/>I think about starting with the highest importance. A43 has high importance and low effort, so it&#x27;s a must. Then A67, C42, C10, C55, C61, B42, B36, C67. But I need to check total effort.<br/><br/>Calculating efforts:<br/><br/>A43:79, A67:585 → 664<br/>C42:548 → 664+548=1212<br/>C10:274 → 1486<br/>C55:388 → 1874<br/>C61:303 → 2177<br/>B42:564 → 2741<br/>B36:374 → 3115<br/>C67:578 → 3115+578=3693.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s under the limit. Total items are 9, which are all high importance. The total effort is 3693, leaving some buffer.<br/><br/>I should also check if adding any other items would increase my total without exceeding the limit. For instance, A18 has effort 913, which alone is almost half the limit. Adding it would likely drop others, but maybe not worth it. Possibly, but not necessary.<br/><br/>I also need to make sure I follow the structure: starting with STRATEGIC REASONING, then any other tags. The previous response started with PROPOSAL, which was wrong.<br/><br/>So, in the current message, the user told me I didn&#x27;t follow the structure, so I need to correct that. Probably, I should think about how to approach the proposal, then prepare the correct response with STRATEGIC REASONING first, followed by the PROPOSAL.<br/><br/>I can outline my thought process as:<br/><br/>1. Sort items by importance descending.<br/>2. Select highest importance items while monitoring effort.<br/>3. Ensure total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 3712.<br/>4. Propose the set that maximizes my total importance.<br/><br/>So, the initial proposal is correct, but the initial response was missing the STRATEGIC REASONING at the start.<br/><br/>Thus, I should begin with the strategic reasoning in the correct format before making the proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: I started by evaluating all items based on their importance to me and their effort requirements. My priority is to select items with the highest importance while ensuring the total effort remains within the 3712 limit.

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the user&#x27;s message. They mentioned that I didn&#x27;t start my response correctly with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. They provided an example of how I should structure my message, starting with strategic reasoning, then other formats like PROPOSAL or ARGUMENT.<br/><br/>First, I need to make sure I understand the interaction protocol correctly. Every message must begin with a strategic reasoning section that&#x27;s hidden from the other player. Then, I can include other structured formats like PROPOSAL or ARGUMENT. The user wants me to strictly follow this format.<br/><br/>Looking back at my previous responses, I see that I might have missed including the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. I need to correct that. So, I should start my response with STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by the other necessary sections.<br/><br/>Next, I should review the items and their efforts and importance scores to make sure my proposal is optimal. I need to maximize the total importance for myself without exceeding the effort limit of 3712.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll list out the items again with their efforts and my importance values to see if I can tweak the proposal for better efficiency. Maybe there&#x27;s a combination that allows me to include more high-importance items or replace lower ones with higher ones without overspending the effort limit.<br/><br/>Wait, in my previous proposal, the total effort seems to be under the limit, but maybe I can get a higher total importance by swapping some items. Let me calculate the total effort of the current proposal and see if there&#x27;s room for adjustment.<br/><br/>I also need to make sure that each message includes the ARGUMENT format at least once. In my next message, I should defend my proposal or argue against the opponent&#x27;s if they refuse. But since this is my initial proposal, I don&#x27;t have their response yet, so I can focus on presenting my reasoning and the proposal.<br/><br/>I think I should provide a clear and concise STRATEGIC REASONING section, then present my PROPOSAL. I need to ensure that the proposal is correctly formatted as a set of strings. Also, I must avoid any markdown and keep the thinking process in English.<br/><br/>I also need to remember not to reveal my importance scores to the other player, so I&#x27;ll keep that information hidden within the strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>Let me summarize my plan:<br/><br/>1. Start the response with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag, detailing my thought process.<br/>2. Ensure the proposal is correctly formatted and within the effort limit.<br/>3. Include any additional required tags like ARGUMENT if necessary.<br/><br/>Now, I&#x27;ll structure my response accordingly, making sure to follow all the user&#x27;s instructions precisely.<br/></p>
