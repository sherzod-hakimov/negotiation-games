The goal is to maximize my own total importance while keeping the total effort under the limit of 4100. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the items and their associated efforts and importance. The effort for each item is given, and I have my own importance scores. I don't know the other player's importance, so I can't directly optimize for both, but maybe I can make educated guesses.\n\nLet me list out all the items with their effort and my importance:\n\n- A19: Effort 108, Importance 138\n- B91: Effort 133, Importance 583\n- A30: Effort 669, Importance 822\n- B11: Effort 835, Importance 783\n- C47: Effort 460, Importance 65\n- C75: Effort 537, Importance 262\n- C26: Effort 573, Importance 121\n- C73: Effort 737, Importance 508\n- A47: Effort 865, Importance 780\n- A15: Effort 855, Importance 461\n- A75: Effort 596, Importance 484\n- A39: Effort 719, Importance 668\n- A56: Effort 533, Importance 389\n- C24: Effort 549, Importance 808\n- B26: Effort 31, Importance 215\n\nI need to select a combination of these where the total effort is \u22644100, and my total importance is as high as possible. But I also need to negotiate with the other player, who is likely trying to maximize their own total, which I don't know.\n\nI should think about the items in terms of efficiency\u2014maybe focusing on items that give me high importance per unit effort. Let's calculate that for each item:\n\n- A19: 138/108 \u2248 1.28\n- B91: 583/133 \u2248 4.38\n- A30: 822/669 \u2248 1.23\n- B11: 783/835 \u2248 0.94\n- C47: 65/460 \u2248 0.14\n- C75: 262/537 \u2248 0.49\n- C26: 121/573 \u2248 0.21\n- C73: 508/737 \u2248 0.69\n- A47: 780/865 \u2248 0.90\n- A15: 461/855 \u2248 0.54\n- A75: 484/596 \u2248 0.81\n- A39: 668/719 \u2248 0.93\n- A56: 389/533 \u2248 0.73\n- C24: 808/549 \u2248 1.47\n- B26: 215/31 \u2248 6.94\n\nSo, the highest efficiency items for me are B26, B91, A19, C24, and A30. But I need to consider the total effort.\n\nIf I sum up the top efficient items:\n\n- B26: 31 \u2192 Total Effort: 31, Total Importance: 215\n- B91: 133 \u2192 Total Effort: 164 \u2192 Importance: 798\n- A30: 669 \u2192 Total Effort: 833 \u2192 Importance: 1620\n- C24: 549 \u2192 Total Effort: 1382 \u2192 Importance: 2428\n- A19: 108 \u2192 Total Effort: 1490 \u2192 Importance: 2566\n\nBut this is already exceeding the limit when I keep adding. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here because I'm summing up more than the limit. Let me approach this differently.\n\nI should prioritize the highest importance per effort first but ensure the total stays under 4100.\n\nLet me consider all possibilities. Since the other player's importance is hidden, I might need to make a proposal that gives me the highest possible while leaving room for compromise.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to create a proposal that includes high-efficiency items for me, and see if the opponent accepts it or not. If not, I can negotiate further.\n\nAnother angle: considering that the other player might prioritize the same items, or other, so I need to strategize which items to include to maximize my gain without overlapping too much.\n\nLet me calculate the total effort if I take the top items based on my efficiency:\n\n- Start with B26: 31\n- Add B91: 133 \u2192 Total: 164\n- Add A30: 669 \u2192 Total: 833\n- Add C24: 549 \u2192 Total: 1382\n- Next, A19: 108 \u2192 1490\n- Then A39: 719 \u2192 2209\n- Then A47: 865 \u2192 3074\n- Then B11: 835 \u2192 3909\n- A75: 596 \u2192 4505 \u2192 Over the limit.\n\nSo up to B11, we get 3909, which is under. If I add more, maybe remove some.\n\nWait, let me see the total of these items:\n\nB26, B91, A30, C24, A19, A39, A47, B11.\n\nEffort: 31+133+669+549+108+719+865+835 = Let's calculate:\n\n31+133=164; 164+669=833; 833+549=1382; +108=1490; +719=2209; 2209+865=3074; 3074+835=3909. So that's 3909, which is under 4100. Total importance: 215+583+822+808+138+668+780+783 = Let me add:\n\n215+583=798; +822=1620; +808=2428; +138=2566; +668=3234; +780=4014; +783=4797. So total importance 4797.\n\nBut this leaves 4100 - 3909 = 191 effort left. Maybe we can add a small item. Let's see the remaining items:\n\nThe items not included yet are C47, C75, C26, C73, A15, A56, A75, A15, etc. Wait, looking back, A15, A56, A75, C26, C47, C73, C75.\n\nWhich of these have the next highest importance per effort? A75: 484/596 \u22480.81; C73:508/737\u22480.69; A56:389/533\u22480.73; C75:262/537\u22480.49; A15:461/855\u22480.54; C26:121/573\u22480.21; C47:65/460\u22480.14.\n\nSo the highest next is A75, which needs 596 effort. Adding that would take the total effort to 3909+596=4505, which is over the limit. So we can't take it all.\n\nMaybe instead of B11 (835), which has an importance of 783, perhaps swap it with another item.\n\nWhat if I remove B11 (effort 835, imp 783) and add A75 (596,484) and C73 (737,508). Let's see the effort: 3909 -835 +596 +737= 3909 -835=3074; 3074+596=3670; +737=4407. Still over.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove B11 and A47 (865,780), which together are 835+865=1700. Effort without them: 3909 -1700=2209.\n\nNow, with 2209, I can add A75 (596) and C73 (737), total effort 2209+596=2805; +737=3542. That's under. But then, what's the total importance: 4797 -783 -780 = 4234. Adding 484 +508 = 992, so total 4234+992=5226. Hmm, higher than before, but with lower effort usage. Wait, but is this allowed? Because I'm removing items I had before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can adjust the selection to include A75 instead of some lower importance items.\n\nWait, let me try to find the optimal set for me, ignoring the opponent's preferences since I don't know them. Then I can propose that, and see how the negotiation goes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes high-efficiency items, but not overload it, leaving some room for negotiation. Because if I propose the maximum, the opponent might refuse and try to take items that are more valuable to them.\n\nLooking at the highest importance items for me: B91 (583), A30 (822), C24 (808), B26 (215), A47 (780), etc. The high importance per effort ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to include a mix of high-efficiency items and some medium ones, without overspending.\n\nLet me try to create a proposal.\n\nSuppose I take B26, B91, A30, C24, A39, A56, C73, and A19.\n\nWait, let's calculate their efforts:\n\nB26:31, B91:133, A30:669, C24:549, A39:719, A56:533, C73:737, A19:108.\n\nTotal effort: 31+133=164; +669=833; +549=1382; +719=2101; +533=2634; +737=3371; +108=3479. That's 3479, which is under 4100. Total importance:215+583+822+808+668+389+508+138 = Let's add: 215+583=798; +822=1620; +808=2428; +668=3096; +389=3485; +508=3993; +138=4131. That's a good total.\n\nBut maybe I can add more to use up the remaining effort. 4100 -3479=621. Let's see if there are items with effort <=621 that I haven't included yet.\n\nLooking at the remaining items: B11 (835) is too big, A47 (865) too big, C75 (537), A15 (855), A75 (596), C47 (460), C26 (573).\n\nWait, A75 is 596, which fits. Adding that would bring total effort to 3479+596=4075, which is under 4100. So the importance would be 4131+484=4615.\n\nSo the proposal would include: B26, B91, A30, C24, A39, A56, C73, A19, A75.\n\nLet me confirm the effort: 31+133+669+549+719+533+737+108+596= Let me add step by step:\n\n31+133=164; +669=833; +549=1382; +719=2101; +533=2634; +737=3371; +108=3479; +596=4075. That's correct, under 4100.\n\nThe importance: 215+583+822+808+668+389+508+138+484= Let's calculate:\n\n215+583=798; +822=1620; +808=2428; +668=3096; +389=3485; +508=3993; +138=4131; +484=4615.\n\nThat's a total importance of 4615, which seems pretty good for me. Now, considering that the other player's preferences are unknown, they might prefer certain items over others. But I don't know, so I have to guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can include some of the items that require less effort, so the other player might accept. But I don't know. Alternatively, I can offer this proposal and see if they accept. If they refuse, I can adjust.\n\nSo, my initial proposal is:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B91', 'B26', 'A30', 'C24', 'A39', 'A56', 'C73', 'A19', 'A75'}\n\nThis gives me a high total importance while keeping under the effort limit.\n",

That probably means the format wasn't followed correctly\u2014maybe the colon and whitespace were missing or the set wasn't properly formatted.\n\nI need to correct this. The correct format is ARGUMENT: {...}. So, I should ensure that in the next message, the ARGUMENT is clearly structured with a colon and the set in curly braces. I need to include this in the response to meet the rules.\n\nAlso, I should maintain a proposal that maximizes the user's importance without exceeding the effort limit. The previous proposal was {'B91', 'B26', 'A30', 'C24', 'A39', 'A56', 'C73', 'A19', 'A75'}. I should recalculate the total effort to ensure it's under 4100. Let me add up the efforts: B91 is 133, B26 is 31, A30 is 669, C24 is 549, A39 is 719, A56 is 533, C73 is 737, A19 is 108, and A75 is 596. Adding these up: 133+31=164, +669=833, +549=1382, +719=2101, +533=2634, +737=3371, +108=3479, +596=4075. Yes, 4075 is under 4100. So the effort is fine.\n\nI also need to frame the argument in a way that's persuasive, highlighting why this set is efficient without giving away the importance values. Maybe mention selecting high-importance items with relatively lower effort.\n\nI should structure the response with both PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT, ensuring both tags are correctly followed by a colon and the sets are properly formatted. No extra text, just the structured messages as per the rules.\n\nSo, I'll send the same proposal but make sure the ARGUMENT is correctly formatted. I'll keep the explanation concise since the user probably just needs a correctly formatted response now.\n",
