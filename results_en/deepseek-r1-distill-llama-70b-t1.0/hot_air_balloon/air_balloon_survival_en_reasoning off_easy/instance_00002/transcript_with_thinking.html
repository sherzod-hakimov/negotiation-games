    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the problem.<br/><br/>We have two players, each with their own importance values for a set of items. The goal is to agree on a set of items whose total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 3218. I need to maximize my total importance, but without knowing the other player&#x27;s importance values.<br/><br/>First, I think I should list out all the items with their effort and my importance. Let me make a table.<br/><br/>Item | Effort | My Importance<br/>-----|--------|-------------<br/>A19  | 919   | 138<br/>B91  | 852   | 583<br/>A30  | 299   | 868<br/>B11  | 762   | 822<br/>C47  | 161   | 783<br/>C75  | 205   | 65<br/>C26  | 380   | 262<br/>C73  | 399   | 121<br/>A47  | 534   | 508<br/>A15  | 333   | 780<br/>A75  | 100   | 461<br/>A39  | 420   | 484<br/>A56  | 354   | 668<br/>C24  | 130   | 389<br/>B26  | 589   | 808<br/><br/>Now, I need to select items where total effort ≤ 3218, and maximize my total importance. Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s preferences, I have to make educated guesses based on possible overlaps and prioritize items where I have high importance.<br/><br/>I should probably start by looking for items that are high importance to me and low effort. Let&#x27;s sort by importance descending and see which ones stand out.<br/><br/>Looking at my importance:<br/><br/>A30: 868<br/>B11: 822<br/>B91: 583<br/>C47: 783<br/>A15: 780<br/>B26: 808<br/>A75: 461<br/>A56: 668<br/>A47: 508<br/>A39: 484<br/>C24: 389<br/>A19: 138<br/>C26: 262<br/>C73: 121<br/>C75: 65<br/><br/>Wait, B26 has 808, which is actually higher than some others. Let me sort properly.<br/><br/>Sorted by my importance descending:<br/><br/>1. A30: 868<br/>2. B11: 822<br/>3. B26: 808<br/>4. C47: 783<br/>5. A15: 780<br/>6. B91: 583<br/>7. A56: 668<br/>8. A75: 461<br/>9. A47: 508<br/>10. A39: 484<br/>11. C24: 389<br/>12. A19: 138<br/>13. C26: 262<br/>14. C73: 121<br/>15. C75: 65<br/><br/>Wait, I think I miscounted. A75 is 461, which is higher than A47 (508) is higher than A39 (484) etc. So perhaps A47 is 508, which comes after A75 in value.<br/><br/>Wait no, 508 is higher than 461. So correct order would be:<br/><br/>1. A30 (868)<br/>2. B11 (822)<br/>3. B26 (808)<br/>4. C47 (783)<br/>5. A15 (780)<br/>6. B91 (583)<br/>7. A56 (668)<br/>8. A47 (508)<br/>9. A39 (484)<br/>10. A75 (461)<br/>11. C24 (389)<br/>12. C26 (262)<br/>13. A19 (138)<br/>14. C73 (121)<br/>15. C75 (65)<br/><br/>Wait, I think I&#x27;m confusing the order. Let me list them correctly:<br/><br/>- A30: 868<br/>- B11: 822<br/>- B26: 808<br/>- C47: 783<br/>- A15: 780<br/>- B91: 583<br/>- A56: 668<br/>- A47: 508<br/>- A39: 484<br/>- A75: 461<br/>- C24: 389<br/>- C26: 262<br/>- A19: 138<br/>- C73: 121<br/>- C75: 65<br/><br/>Now, the idea is to pick items that give me the highest importance without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>I think a good approach is to try to include as many high-importance items as possible, starting from the top, making sure the total effort doesn&#x27;t go over.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player has different priorities, so I need to find a set that is mutually acceptable.<br/><br/>But for my first proposal, I can aim for a set that maximizes my gain, while leaving some room for the other player&#x27;s preferences.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can look for a combination that gives me the highest importance, and see if the effort is within limit.<br/><br/>Let me try adding the top items:<br/><br/>Start with A30 (868, 299) total so far: 299, importance: 868.<br/><br/>Next, B26 (808, 589). Total effort: 299+589=888, which is way below 3218. Importance: 868+808=1676.<br/><br/>Next, B11 (822, 762). 888+762=1650. Effort total: 1650, importance: 1676+822=2498.<br/><br/>Next, A15 (780, 333). 1650+333=1983. Importance: 2498+780=3278.<br/><br/>Next, B91 (583, 852). 1983+852=2835. Effort is 2835, which is under 3218. Importance: 3278+583=3861.<br/><br/>Next, A56 (668, 354). 2835+354=3189. Still under. Importance: 3861+668=4529.<br/><br/>Next, A47 (508, 534). 3189+534=3723. Over the limit 3218. So can&#x27;t include that.<br/><br/>So current set: A30, B26, B11, A15, B91, A56. Total effort: 3189. Importance:4529.<br/><br/>Is there a way to include more items without exceeding effort?<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe I can swap some items to get higher total importance. Let&#x27;s check.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after A30, B26, B11, A15, B91, A56, which is 3189 effort, I have 3218-3189=29 left. So maybe add an item with effort ≤29. Looking at the list, the smallest effort is C75:205, which is too big. So no more items can be added.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can replace some items to include more high-importance ones without exceeding the effort.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps including C47:783 importance, which is high, but its effort is 161. So let me check.<br/><br/>If I take C47:783 instead of some other item.<br/><br/>Looking back, the current set gives 4529. If I replace A56 (668) with C47 (783), what&#x27;s the effort? A56 is 354, C47 is 161. So replacing would save 354-161=193 effort. Then I could add another item. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>New set: A30, B26, B11, A15, B91, C47.<br/><br/>Effort: 299+589+762+333+852+161=299+589=888+762=1650+333=1983+852=2835+161=3000- huh, 299+589=888, +762=1650, +333=1983, +852=2835, +161=3000-? Wait, 2835+161=2996. So effort is 2996, leaving 3218-2996=222 left.<br/><br/>Now, with 222 effort left, can I add more items? Let&#x27;s see: remaining items not in the set are A19, A39, A47, A75, C24, C26, C73, C75.<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort ≤222:<br/><br/>A75:100 is 100, which is within.<br/><br/>A39:420 is too big.<br/><br/>C24:130, which is under 222.<br/><br/>So perhaps add C24 (389) importance. So total effort would be 2996+130=3126. 3218-3126=92 left.<br/><br/>Now, can I add another item with ≤92 effort? A75 is 100 is over, C73 is 399 no, C26 is 380 no, C75 is 205 too big. So only C24 can be added.<br/><br/>So with C24 added, total importance: 4529 (original set) - A56 (668) + C47 (783) + C24 (389). So 4529-668=3861+783=4644+389=5033.<br/><br/>So that&#x27;s a better total: 5033.<br/><br/>Is that better than the previous 4529? Yes.<br/><br/>Alternatively, what if I include both C47 and A56? Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Current set without A56: A30, B26, B11, A15, B91, C47. Effort:2996.<br/><br/>Add A56: 354. 2996+354=3350, which is under 3218? Wait, 2996+354=3350, which is over the limit. So no, can&#x27;t include both.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best is to include C47 and C24, getting 5033 importance.<br/><br/>Wait, but let me check the numbers again.<br/><br/>Original set: A30, B26, B11, A15, B91, A56. Effort:299+589=888+762=1650+333=1983+852=2835+354=3189. Importance:868+808=1676+822=2498+780=3278+583=3861+668=4529.<br/><br/>If I replace A56 (354) with C47 (161), effort saved: 193, and then add C24 (130), effort added:130, so total effort:3189-354+161+130=3189-354 is 2835+161=3000-? Wait, 3189-354=2835, then 2835+161=2996, then +130=3126. That&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Importance:4529 -668 (A56) +783 (C47) +389 (C24) =4529-668=3861+783=4644+389=5033.<br/><br/>That seems better.<br/><br/>Is there a way to get even more importance?<br/><br/>Let me check other high-importance items.<br/><br/>What if I drop B91 (583) to include more items?<br/><br/>Wait, B91 has effort 852. If I drop that, I save 852, which is significant. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Current set without B91: A30, B26, B11, A15, C47, C24. Effort:299+589+762+333+161+130= let&#x27;s add:<br/><br/>299+589=888+762=1650+333=1983+161=2144+130=2274. So effort is 2274, leaving 3218-2274=944.<br/><br/>Now, with 944 effort left, what can I add?<br/><br/>Looking for high-importance items.<br/><br/>B91 (852, 583) can be added, bringing effort to 2274+852=3126, and importance +583.<br/><br/>But then with 3218-3126=92 left, no more items. So total importance would be 5033-583 (since I had to drop B91 earlier) +583 (adding it back) + whatever else.<br/><br/>Wait, no, in this scenario, I&#x27;m considering replacing B91 with C47 and C24 and then adding B91 again.<br/><br/>But I&#x27;m getting confused. Let me try a different approach.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best approach is to generate a proposal that includes the highest importance items for me and fits within the limit. Then, if the opponent refuses, I can negotiate further, possibly swapping items.<br/><br/>So, considering all this, my initial PROPOSAL would be to include items that give me the highest total importance without exceeding 3218 effort. From earlier, the set with A30, B26, B11, A15, B91, C47, C24 gives total effort 3126 and total importance 5033.<br/><br/>But wait, that&#x27;s within the limit, and quite high for me. But perhaps the opponent has some must-have items that I don&#x27;t know about. So maybe I can include some medium-importance items that might satisfy both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player&#x27;s high-importance items are different. For example, if the other player values B91 highly, but I only have it at 583, which is moderate.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I don&#x27;t know their preferences, I have to make my best guess. So including A30 (868) is crucial for me, as it&#x27;s my highest. Then B26 (808), B11 (822), etc.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, my initial proposal would include the highest importance items for me, fitting under the effort limit.<br/><br/>Another thought: what&#x27;s the total effort of all items? Let me calculate:<br/><br/>Calculate sum(effort for all items):<br/><br/>919 + 852 = 1771<br/>+299=2070<br/>+762=2832<br/>+161=2993<br/>+205=3198<br/>+380=3578<br/>+399=3977<br/>+534=4511<br/>+333=4844<br/>+100=4944<br/>+420=5364<br/>+354=5718<br/>+130=5848<br/>+589=6437<br/><br/>Wait, 6437 total effort. But the limit is 3218, so I can&#x27;t take all.<br/><br/>But perhaps making a proposal with high importance items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, another approach is to prioritize based on importance per effort. Maybe that&#x27;s a better way.<br/><br/>Compute importance per effort ratio:<br/><br/>A30:868/299 ≈ 2.90<br/>B11:822/762 ≈1.08<br/>B26:808/589≈1.37<br/>C47:783/161≈4.86<br/>A15:780/333≈2.34<br/>B91:583/852≈0.68<br/>A56:668/354≈1.89<br/>A47:508/534≈0.95<br/>A39:484/420≈1.15<br/>A75:461/100≈4.61<br/>C24:389/130≈2.99<br/>C26:262/380≈0.69<br/>A19:138/919≈0.15<br/>C73:121/399≈0.30<br/>C75:65/205≈0.31<br/><br/>So, the highest ratios are:<br/><br/>C47:4.86, A75:4.61, C24:2.99, A30:2.90, A15:2.34, A56:1.89, B26:1.37, B11:1.08, etc.<br/><br/>So, C47 and A75 have the highest ratios. So perhaps including them is more efficient.<br/><br/>So maybe a better strategy is to include items with the highest importance per effort first.<br/><br/>Start with C47 (783, 161) → sum E=161, I=783<br/>Then A75 (461,100) → E=261, I=1244<br/>Next, A30 (868,299) → E=560, I=2112<br/>Next, C24 (389,130) → E=690, I=2501<br/>Next, B26 (808,589) → E=690+589=1279, I=2501+808=3309<br/>Next, B11 (822,762) → Can we add? 1279+762=2041 &lt;3218. I=3309+822=4131<br/>Next, A15 (780,333) → 2041+333=2374, I=4131+780=4911<br/>Next, B91 (583,852) → Can we add? 2374+852=3226&gt;3218, so no.<br/>So, omit B91.<br/>Alternatively, can we add A56 (668,354) instead? 2374+354=2728. Then importance +668 =4911+668=5579.<br/><br/>Wait, but wait: after adding B11, E=2041, I=4131.<br/><br/>Add A15:333 → E=2374, I=4911.<br/><br/>Then check if we can add A56:354 → E=2374+354=2728, I=4911+668=5579. Then remaining effort:3218-2728=490.<br/><br/>Can we add B91 (852) → No, since 2728+852&gt;3218. What about A47 (534)? 2728+534=3262&gt;3218. No.<br/><br/>What about C26 (380)? Effort=380, which would bring E to 2728+380=3108. I=5579+262=5841.<br/><br/>Then remaining effort:3218-3108=110. Can&#x27;t add anything else.<br/><br/>So set includes C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B11, A15, A56, C26. Effort=161+100+299+130+589+762+333+354+380= Let me calculate:<br/><br/>161+100=261<br/>+299=560<br/>+130=690<br/>+589=1279<br/>+762=2041<br/>+333=2374<br/>+354=2728<br/>+380=3108.<br/><br/>Effort:3108, which is under 3218. Total importance:783+461=1244+868=2112+389=2501+808=3309+822=4131+780=4911+668=5579+262=5841.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a higher total than before. So this approach seems better.<br/><br/>Wait, but is this the best? Let&#x27;s check the remaining effort:3218-3108=110. Any item with effort ≤110 left? Let me see.<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items not in the set: A19 (919), B91 (852), A47 (534), A39 (420), C73 (399), C75 (205). None of these are ≤110. So no.<br/><br/>So this set gives me 5841.<br/><br/>Is this better than the previous set? Earlier set (with C47, C24, etc.) gave 5033, but this gives 5841. So better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, could I include more high-ratio items?<br/><br/>Wait, after adding C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B11, A15, A56, C26, and then see if I can add any other item that doesn&#x27;t exceed effort.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe add A75 first. Let me think again.<br/><br/>Order of addition: prioritize highest ratio first.<br/><br/>C47 (4.86)<br/><br/>Then A75 (4.61)<br/><br/>Then C24 (2.99)<br/><br/>Then A30 (2.90)<br/><br/>Then A15 (2.34)<br/><br/>Then A56 (1.89)<br/><br/>Then B26 (1.37)<br/><br/>Then B11 (1.08)<br/><br/>So, trying this order:<br/><br/>C47 (161,783) → E=161, I=783<br/><br/>A75 (100,461) → E=261, I=1244<br/><br/>C24 (130,389) → E=391, I=1633<br/><br/>A30 (299,868) → E=690, I=2501<br/><br/>A15 (333,780) → E=1023, I=3281<br/><br/>A56 (354,668) → E=1377, I=3949<br/><br/>B26 (589,808) → E=1377+589=1966, I=3949+808=4757<br/><br/>B11 (762,822) → E=1966+762=2728, I=4757+822=5579<br/><br/>Now, E=2728, remaining=3218-2728=490.<br/><br/>Can we add B91 (852)? No, since 2728+852&gt;3218.<br/><br/>Add C26 (380)? 2728+380=3108, I=5579+262=5841.<br/><br/>E=3108, remaining=110.<br/><br/>No more items can be added. So total I=5841.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s the same as before.<br/><br/>So perhaps this is the optimal set for me, but I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s preferences.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the opponent has some items they really need, so I should try to include those items to make them agree.<br/><br/>But without knowing, I can proceed with this set as my PROPOSAL.<br/><br/>Let me check the total effort: 3108 ≤3218.<br/><br/>So PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C26&#x27;}<br/><br/>But wait, checking the item list: Is C26 included? Yes, but in the initial list, its effort is 380.<br/><br/>Wait, the set is C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B11, A15, A56, C26. Let me add up the efforts:<br/><br/>161+100=261<br/><br/>+130=391<br/><br/>+299=690<br/><br/>+333=1023<br/><br/>+354=1377<br/><br/>+589=1966<br/><br/>+762=2728<br/><br/>+380=3108.<br/><br/>Yes, correct.<br/><br/>This gives total effort 3108, which is under 3218.<br/><br/>Total importance:783+461=1244+868=2112+389=2501+808=3309+822=4131+780=4911+668=5579+262=5841.<br/><br/>This seems like a strong starting point.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can see if adding B91 (583,852) is possible by replacing some lower ratio items.<br/><br/>But if I include B91, I&#x27;d need to remove items whose combined effort is 852 - (3218 - 3108)=852-110=742. So I&#x27;d need to replace some items.<br/><br/>But considering the ratios, B91 has a ratio of 0.68, which is low. So it&#x27;s probably not worth including unless the other player really wants it. So in my initial proposal, I&#x27;ll stick with the high-ratio items.<br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll propose this set.<br/><br/>I think this is a good starting point. Now, I should present this as a PROPOSAL.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond in this negotiation game. Let me break down what happened so far. <br/><br/>First, the user made a proposal: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C26&#x27;}. Then, I pointed out that the response didn&#x27;t include an argument, which is required. The user then provided another proposal with the same set and added an argument. So, I need to respond appropriately.<br/><br/>I need to remember the rules: I can&#x27;t reveal my importance scores, and I have to use the structured formats. My goal is to maximize my own total importance while keeping the effort under 3218. <br/><br/>Looking at the user&#x27;s proposed set, I should calculate the total effort to see if it&#x27;s within the limit. Let&#x27;s add up the efforts:<br/><br/>- C47: 783 (Wait, no, wait. The item efforts are given as a separate list. Let me check the effort values again.)<br/><br/>Wait, the effort for each item is as follows:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;A19&quot;: 919, &quot;B91&quot;: 852, &quot;A30&quot;: 299, &quot;B11&quot;: 762, &quot;C47&quot;: 161, &quot;C75&quot;: 205, &quot;C26&quot;: 380, &quot;C73&quot;: 399, &quot;A47&quot;: 534, &quot;A15&quot;: 333, &quot;A75&quot;: 100, &quot;A39&quot;: 420, &quot;A56&quot;: 354, &quot;C24&quot;: 130, &quot;B26&quot;: 589}<br/><br/>So, let&#x27;s compute the total effort for the proposed set:<br/><br/>- C47: 161<br/>- A75: 100<br/>- A30: 299<br/>- C24: 130<br/>- B26: 589<br/>- B11: 762<br/>- A15: 333<br/>- A56: 354<br/>- C26: 380<br/><br/>Adding these up:<br/><br/>161 + 100 = 261<br/>261 + 299 = 560<br/>560 + 130 = 690<br/>690 + 589 = 1279<br/>1279 + 762 = 2041<br/>2041 + 333 = 2374<br/>2374 + 354 = 2728<br/>2728 + 380 = 3108<br/><br/>Hmm, 3108 is under 3218, so the effort is within the limit.<br/><br/>Now, considering my own importance values, I need to see how much benefit I get from this proposal. Let&#x27;s compute the total importance for me:<br/><br/>The importance values are:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;A19&quot;: 138, &quot;B91&quot;: 583, &quot;A30&quot;: 868, &quot;B11&quot;: 822, &quot;C47&quot;: 783, &quot;C75&quot;: 65, &quot;C26&quot;: 262, &quot;C73&quot;: 121, &quot;A47&quot;: 508, &quot;A15&quot;: 780, &quot;A75&quot;: 461, &quot;A39&quot;: 484, &quot;A56&quot;: 668, &quot;C24&quot;: 389, &quot;B26&quot;: 808}<br/><br/>So, for the proposed items:<br/><br/>C47: 783<br/>A75: 461<br/>A30: 868<br/>C24: 389<br/>B26: 808<br/>B11: 822<br/>A15: 780<br/>A56: 668<br/>C26: 262<br/><br/>Adding these up:<br/><br/>783 + 461 = 1244<br/>1244 + 868 = 2112<br/>2112 + 389 = 2501<br/>2501 + 808 = 3309<br/>3309 + 822 = 4131<br/>4131 + 780 = 4911<br/>4911 + 668 = 6579<br/>6579 + 262 = 6841<br/><br/>So, this proposal gives me a total importance of 6841. <br/><br/>Now, I need to decide whether to accept, refuse, or make a counter-proposal. But since I have to follow the protocol, I can&#x27;t accept yet unless I agree. The user&#x27;s argument was that this set includes high-importance items while staying under the effort limit and maximizing their benefit. <br/><br/>I should check if there&#x27;s a better combination for myself. Maybe I can include more high-importance items without exceeding the effort limit. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can refuse this proposal and make a counter-proposal. But I need to argue why, perhaps pointing out that certain items could be swapped to benefit both parties more.<br/><br/>Wait, but I have to include an argument with my response, so maybe I should refuse and provide a reason, or maybe agree if this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Looking at my items, perhaps I can see if swapping some items could increase my total. For example, if I can include more of my high-importance items without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user&#x27;s proposal is already quite good because it includes several high-importance items for me. <br/><br/>But wait, maybe I can propose a different set that gives me more importance. Let me think about that.<br/><br/>Looking at the user&#x27;s set, I can see that they included B26 (importance 808 for me) and B11 (822). Those are both high. C47 is 783, which is high. A30 is 868, which is very high for me. So, from my perspective, this is a good set because it includes several of my high-importance items.<br/><br/>But let me check if I can get more. Let&#x27;s see what items are not included in the user&#x27;s proposal:<br/><br/>Excluded items: A19, B91, C75, C73, A47, A39, C24 (wait, no, C24 is included), A75 (included), A15 (included), A56 (included), C26 (included). Wait, no: the excluded items would be the ones not in the proposal. Let me list all items:<br/><br/>Total items are: A19, B91, A30, B11, C47, C75, C26, C73, A47, A15, A75, A39, A56, C24, B26.<br/><br/>In the proposal, the included items are: C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B11, A15, A56, C26. So excluded are: A19, B91, C75, C73, A47, A39.<br/><br/>So, are there any high-importance items for me that are excluded? Let&#x27;s see my importance values:<br/><br/>A19:138, B91:583, A30:868, B11:822, C47:783, C75:65, C26:262, C73:121, A47:508, A15:780, A75:461, A39:484, A56:668, C24:389, B26:808.<br/><br/>So, A30 is included and is very high. B11, C47, B26 are also high. A15, A56, A75 are also included.<br/><br/>The highest excluded item is B91 with 583. So if I can include B91 in the proposal without exceeding the effort limit, that might be better for me.<br/><br/>But B91 has an effort of 852, which is high. Let&#x27;s see if swapping some items can make room for B91.<br/><br/>The current proposal has a total effort of 3108, so 3218 - 3108 = 110 left. So I could potentially add more items up to 110 effort, but the proposal is already including 9 items. Alternatively, swapping.<br/><br/>Suppose I try to include B91 (effort 852). If I remove some items to make space.<br/><br/>Current total effort: 3108. If I remove some items and add B91, I need to ensure the total doesn&#x27;t exceed 3218.<br/><br/>Let me see, for example, removing some lower-importance items for me and adding B91. Let&#x27;s consider:<br/><br/>If I remove, say, C24 (effort 130) and C26 (380), that&#x27;s 510 effort saved. Adding B91 (852) would need to see if 852 - 510 = 342 more effort, so total stays same. Wait, no:<br/><br/>Wait, the current total is 3108. If I remove C24 (130) and C26 (380), that&#x27;s 510. So, subtracting 510 from 3108 gives 2598. Then adding B91 (852) would bring it to 2598 + 852 = 3450, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s no good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe removing two items with higher effort but lower importance. For me, C26 has importance 262, and C24 has 389. Maybe I can remove both (total effort 130 + 380 = 510) and add B91 (852), but as above, it&#x27;s over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe just remove one item. Let&#x27;s say remove C26 (380) and try to add B91 (852). Then 3108 - 380 = 2728. 2728 + 852 = 3580, which is way over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps remove A56 (effort 354) and A15 (333). Their combined effort is 687. Removing them and adding B91 (852) would be 3108 - 687 = 2421, plus 852 = 3273, which is still under 3218? No, 3273 &gt; 3218, so no.<br/><br/>Wait, 3218 is the limit. So 2421 + 852 = 3273, which is 55 over. Not allowed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove A56 (354) and A39 (420), but A39 isn&#x27;t in the current proposal. Wait, in the current proposal, A39 isn&#x27;t included, so I can&#x27;t remove it.<br/><br/>Wait, in the current proposal, A39 isn&#x27;t included, so maybe I can&#x27;t remove it. So perhaps I can&#x27;t find a way to include B91 without exceeding the limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe other swaps. Let&#x27;s think. Are there lower-effort items I can remove to make space for B91 without the effort going over?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can remove A75 (100) and A30 (299), but that&#x27;s too much. That would save 399, but B91 is 852, so 852 - 399 = 453, adding to 3108, making 3561, which is way over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps removing B26 (589) and adding B91 (852). 589 vs 852: difference is 263. So, removing B26 (589) and adding B91 (852) would require adding 263 more effort. Since the current total is 3108, 3108 - 589 = 2519, plus 852 = 3371, which is over by 153.<br/><br/>So that&#x27;s not feasible. Maybe remove multiple lower-importance items to make room.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to stick with the current proposal since adding B91 seems too effort-heavy.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can swap A75 (100) with B91. So, if I remove A75 (100) and add B91 (852), the effort increases by 752. Current total is 3108, so 3108 - 100 = 3008, plus 852 = 3860, which is way over. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Hmm, so maybe including B91 isn&#x27;t feasible without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Another approach: Perhaps I can include more of my high-importance items that are not yet in the proposal. For example, A47: importance 508, effort 534. But that&#x27;s high effort. Let&#x27;s see if I can swap.<br/><br/>In the current proposal, the total effort is 3108. If I can find items in the proposal that I can swap with A47 and maybe another item to stay within limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe another high-importance item like C73: 121 importance, which is low, so probably not worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s check A39: importance 484, effort 420. Maybe swapping in A39 and removing some lower-importance items.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the proposal, what&#x27;s the lowest importance for me? The items in the proposal have: C24 (389), C26 (262), A75 (461), A56 (668), A15 (780), etc. So, perhaps C26 is the lowest at 262. Maybe I can remove C26 (380 effort) and add A39 (420 effort). Let&#x27;s compute:<br/><br/>Current effort: 3108. Remove C26 (380), so 3108 - 380 = 2728. Add A39 (420), so 2728 + 420 = 3148, which is under the limit.<br/><br/>So, new set would be: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A39&#x27;}, with total effort 3148. <br/><br/>What&#x27;s the total importance for me?<br/><br/>C47:783, A75:461, A30:868, C24:389, B26:808, B11:822, A15:780, A56:668, A39:484.<br/><br/>Total: 783 + 461 = 1244<br/>+868 = 2112<br/>+389 = 2501<br/>+808 = 3309<br/>+822 = 4131<br/>+780 = 4911<br/>+668 = 6579<br/>+484 = 7063<br/><br/>So, total importance increased from 6841 to 7063 by swapping C26 (262) for A39 (484), which is a gain of 222 in importance. That&#x27;s a good trade for me.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I can propose this modification. Alternatively, maybe I can consider swapping more items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove both C26 and C24 (130) and add A39 (420) and maybe another item. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Removing C26 (380) and C24 (130) gives 510 effort saved. Adding A39 (420) and what else? 510 - 420 = 90 left. So I can add another item with effort up to 90. The remaining items not in the original proposal are A19 (919), B91 (852), C75 (205), C73 (399), A47 (534), A39 (420). <br/><br/>But the effort left is only 90, so only items with effort ≤90. Looking at the effort list, perhaps C75 has 205, which is too high, C73:399, A47:534, etc., all too high. So no, can&#x27;t add any other item with the remaining 90.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to just swap C26 for A39, as that gives me more importance without needing to remove more items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove both C26 and A75 (100) and add A39 (420) and something else. Let me compute effort: remove 380 + 100 = 480; add 420 + x, where x ≤480 -420=60. No items have effort ≤60 except maybe none. So that&#x27;s not feasible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps removing C24 (130) and C26 (380) to add A39 (420) and maybe another small item. Wait, but I just did that and couldn&#x27;t add anything else.<br/><br/>So, perhaps the best I can do is to swap C26 for A39, increasing my total importance. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I can find other swaps that give me more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove C24 (130) and add another item. Let&#x27;s see, C24 is 130. Removing it gives me 130 effort to play with. What&#x27;s the highest importance item I can add with 130 effort? Looking at the excluded items:<br/><br/>A19:919 (too high), B91:852, C75:205, C73:399, A47:534, A39:420, etc. All are over 130. So nothing can be added, so that&#x27;s not helpful.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove C24 (130) and add nothing, reducing total effort to 3108 -130=2978, but that just removes an item without adding anything, which reduces my total importance by 389. Not good.<br/><br/>So, the best option is to swap C26 (262) for A39 (484), getting a higher importance without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the user&#x27;s proposal is acceptable, but I can try to negotiate for a better deal.<br/><br/>So, I can respond by refusing the proposal and making a counter-proposal with this swap. But I need to structure my response.<br/><br/>I can do:<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C26&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: I can improve our mutual benefit by replacing lower-importance items with higher ones without increasing effort beyond the limit.<br/><br/>Then, propose the new set with A39 instead of C26.<br/><br/>But wait, the effort for A39 is 420, and C26 is 380. So replacing C26 (380) with A39 (420) increases effort by 40. So, total effort would become 3108 -380 +420 = 3148, which is under 3218.<br/><br/>Yes, that works. So, in the counter-proposal, I can include A39 and exclude C26.<br/><br/>So, the new proposal would be {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A39&#x27;}, and the total effort is 3148.<br/><br/>But I need to compute it again to confirm.<br/><br/>C47:161, A75:100, A30:299, C24:130, B26:589, B11:762, A15:333, A56:354, A39:420.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s add these up:<br/><br/>161 + 100 = 261<br/>+299 = 560<br/>+130 = 690<br/>+589 = 1279<br/>+762 = 2041<br/>+333 = 2374<br/>+354 = 2728<br/>+420 = 3148.<br/><br/>Yes, correct.<br/><br/>So, the new proposal has a total effort of 3148, which is within the limit.<br/><br/>Now, I need to make this as a counter-proposal, refusing the previous one.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the user might accept this, or maybe counter again.<br/><br/>But I should make sure I&#x27;m maximizing my own benefit, so perhaps this is a better deal for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let me see if I can include B91 by making some other swaps.<br/><br/>Wait, to include B91, I need to free up 852 effort. Let&#x27;s see if I can remove enough items.<br/><br/>Looking at the current proposal, if I remove B11 (762) and A56 (354), that&#x27;s 1116 effort saved. Then I can add B91 (852) and maybe another item.<br/><br/>1116 -852 = 264 left. So I can add another item with effort ≤264.<br/><br/>Looking at the excluded items, maybe C73 (399) is too high, but perhaps C75 (205). So adding B91 (852) and C75 (205). Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Total effort would be 3108 -762 -354 +852 +205 = 3108 -1116 = 1992, +852=2844, +205=3049.<br/><br/>Now, check the total effort: 3049, which is under 3218.<br/><br/>Now, what&#x27;s the total importance for me?<br/><br/>In the new proposal, we have:<br/><br/>C47:783, A75:461, A30:868, C24:389, B26:808, B91:583, C75:65, A15:780, A56: removed, so wait, no. Wait, I&#x27;m adding B91 and C75, but in the new set, I have to make sure which items are included.<br/><br/>Wait, original proposal without B11 and A56, and adding B91 and C75.<br/><br/>So the new set would be:<br/><br/>C47:783, A75:461, A30:868, C24:389, B26:808, B91:583, C75:65, A15:780.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 8 items. But let me check if that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Wait, I need to ensure that the total effort is correctly calculated.<br/><br/>Effort:<br/><br/>C47:161, A75:100, A30:299, C24:130, B26:589, B91:852, C75:205, A15:333.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 161+100=261, +299=560, +130=690, +589=1279, +852=2131, +205=2336, +333=2669. That&#x27;s way below 3218. So perhaps I can include more items.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps that&#x27;s a miscalculation. Let me add them again:<br/><br/>161 +100 =261<br/><br/>+299=560<br/><br/>+130=690<br/><br/>+589=1279<br/><br/>+852=2131<br/><br/>+205=2336<br/><br/>+333=2669<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s only 2669. So, 2669 is way below 3218. So, I have 3218 -2669=549 left.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I can add more items. Which items are left? A39 (420), A56 (354), C26 (380), C73 (399), A19 (919), A47 (534). <br/><br/>Let&#x27;s try adding A56:354. So total effort becomes 2669 +354=3023, which is under 3218. So, the set now includes A56.<br/><br/>So, the set is: C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B91, C75, A15, A56.<br/><br/>Total effort:3023.<br/><br/>Importance for me: C47:783, A75:461, A30:868, C24:389, B26:808, B91:583, C75:65, A15:780, A56:668.<br/><br/>Total: 783+461=1244, +868=2112, +389=2501, +808=3309, +583=3892, +65=3957, +780=4737, +668=5405.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s a significant increase. 5405 importance for me. But does the effort stay within limit? Yes, 3023.<br/><br/>But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in this scenario, I&#x27;m removing B11 and A56, but then adding A56 back in. That seems contradictory. Let me clarify:<br/><br/>Wait, no, initially, in this scenario, I removed B11 and A56 to add B91 and C75, but then added A56 back, which might not be correct because I can&#x27;t have A56 both removed and added. Let me re-express:<br/><br/>If I remove B11 (762) and A56 (354), that&#x27;s 1116 saved. Adding B91 (852) and C75 (205) uses 852+205=1057. So, 1116 saved -1057 used = 59 saved. So the total effort would be 3108 -1116 +1057 = 3049, as previously thought.<br/><br/>Then, with the saved 59, perhaps I can add another item. For example, A56 (354) requires 354, which is more than 59, so can&#x27;t add. But perhaps C26 (380) is too big. Alternatively, maybe A39 (420) is too big. So, perhaps I can add nothing else.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps just adding B91 and C75, with the saved effort, but not adding A56. So the set would be:<br/><br/>C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B91, C75, A15.<br/><br/>Effort: 161+100+299+130+589+852+205+333= let&#x27;s compute:<br/><br/>161 +100=261<br/><br/>+299=560<br/><br/>+130=690<br/><br/>+589=1279<br/><br/>+852=2131<br/><br/>+205=2336<br/><br/>+333=2669.<br/><br/>So, 2669, leaving 549 unused. Then, can I add another item within 549? Yes, for example, A39 (420) and A56 (354). Let&#x27;s see: 420+354=774, which is more than 549. So, can&#x27;t add both. Let&#x27;s try adding A56 (354). Then 2669+354=3023, leaving 195. Then maybe add C26 (380), which is too big. So no. Alternatively, add A39 (420), which would make 2669+420=3089, leaving 129. Then, perhaps add C24? No, already included. Or maybe C26 (380), but that would be over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the best is to add A56 (354), making effort 3023. Then, the set becomes: C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B91, C75, A15, A56.<br/><br/>Importance for me: C47:783, A75:461, A30:868, C24:389, B26:808, B91:583, C75:65, A15:780, A56:668.<br/><br/>Total importance: 783+461=1244, +868=2112, +389=2501, +808=3309, +583=3892, +65=3957, +780=4737, +668=5405.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a significant increase from the original 6841. However, the effort is 3023, leaving 3218-3023=195 unused. Maybe I can add another small item, but looking at the remaining, only C73 (399), which is too big, or C26 (380), also too big. So, perhaps this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>But wait, in this scenario, I&#x27;m including B91, which has high importance for me (583), but losing B11 (822) and A56 (668). Wait, in this set, I have added A56, so it&#x27;s included. So, comparing:<br/><br/>Original proposal&#x27;s importance: 6841.<br/><br/>New set:5405. Wait, that&#x27;s lower. Wait, that can&#x27;t be. Wait, 5405 is less than 6841? No, 5405 is higher. Wait, 5405 is higher than 6841. No, wait, 5405 is higher than 6841? No, wait: 5405 is less than 6841? Wait, no, 5405 is higher than 6841? Wait, 6841 is higher than 5405.<br/><br/>Wait, no: 6841 is higher than 5405. So, in this new set, I&#x27;m getting 5405, which is less than the original 6841. So, this is worse for me. So that&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let&#x27;s recalculate the total importance:<br/><br/>C47:783<br/><br/>A75:461 → 1244<br/><br/>A30:868 → 2112<br/><br/>C24:389 → 2501<br/><br/>B26:808 → 3309<br/><br/>B91:583 → 3892<br/><br/>C75:65 → 3957<br/><br/>A15:780 → 4737<br/><br/>A56:668 → 5405.<br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s correct. So, the total is 5405. Comparing to the original 6841, that&#x27;s a decrease. So, that&#x27;s worse for me.<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps including B91 is not beneficial because it requires removing high-importance items like B11 and others, leading to a lower total.<br/><br/>So, perhaps the original proposal is better for me, giving me 6841. Therefore, maybe I should accept it or try to make a better counter-proposal without losing so much.<br/><br/>Wait, but the swap I initially considered, replacing C26 with A39, gives me 7063, which is better than 6841. So that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps I should make that swap.<br/><br/>So, in that case, the proposal becomes: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A39&#x27;}, with total effort 3148.<br/><br/>This gives me 7063 importance, which is better than 6841. So that&#x27;s a better deal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can make other swaps.<br/><br/>Another approach: perhaps see if I can include both A39 and C26. But effort-wise, it&#x27;s 420 +380=800. Let&#x27;s see if removing two items can free up that.<br/><br/>Looking at the original proposal: total effort is 3108. If I want to add A39 and C26 (though C26 is already in the proposal), wait no, in the original proposal, C26 is already included. So, perhaps that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Wait, no, in the original proposal, C26 is included. So, perhaps I&#x27;m confusing myself.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove some lower-importance items and add A39 and another item.<br/><br/>Wait, it&#x27;s getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe it&#x27;s better to stick with the initial swap: replacing C26 with A39, increasing my total importance by 222, and keeping the effort under the limit.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll structure my response as refusing the original proposal and making a counter-proposal with the swap, along with an argument explaining why it&#x27;s better.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I need to agree on a set of items with another participant without exceeding a total effort limit of 3218. Each item has both an effort value and an importance value, but I can only see my own importance scores. My goal is to maximize my own total importance while staying under the limit.<br/><br/>Looking at the initial messages, I proposed a set and the other player refused, arguing that it can be optimized for higher importance for them. They then proposed a different set, but I realized I need to make sure each message includes the argument format. <br/><br/>Now, I need to analyze the previous proposal and see why it was refused. The proposed set includes &#x27;A39&#x27; instead of &#x27;C26&#x27;. Let me calculate the total effort to see if it&#x27;s under the limit and assess the importance gained.<br/><br/>Calculating the effort:<br/><br/>- A75: 100<br/>- C47: 161<br/>- A30: 299<br/>- C24: 130<br/>- B26: 589<br/>- B11: 762<br/>- A15: 333<br/>- A56: 354<br/>- A39: 420<br/><br/>Adding these up:<br/><br/>100 + 161 = 261<br/>261 + 299 = 560<br/>560 + 130 = 690<br/>690 + 589 = 1279<br/>1279 + 762 = 2041<br/>2041 + 333 = 2374<br/>2374 + 354 = 2728<br/>2728 + 420 = 3148<br/><br/>3148 is under 3218, so effort is okay. Now, looking at my importance values:<br/><br/>- A75: 461<br/>- C47: 783<br/>- A30: 868<br/>- C24: 389<br/>- B26: 808<br/>- B11: 822<br/>- A15: 780<br/>- A56: 668<br/>- A39: 484<br/><br/>Total importance: 461+783=1244; +868=2112; +389=2501; +808=3309; +822=4131; +780=4911; +668=5579; +484=6063. That&#x27;s a total of 6063 importance for me.<br/><br/>I need to compare this to my initial proposal to see which is better for me. My initial proposal was:<br/><br/>C47, A75, A30, C24, B26, B11, A15, A56, C26. Efforts:<br/>919, 100, 299, 130, 589, 762, 333, 354, 380. Wait, that&#x27;s 919 for A19, but my proposal didn&#x27;t include A19. Wait, no, my initial PROPOSAL was different.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the initial PROPOSAL was:<br/><br/>{&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;C26&#x27;}<br/><br/>Let me recalculate the effort for that set:<br/><br/>C47: 161, A75: 100, A30:299, C24:130, B26:589, B11:762, A15:333, A56:354, C26:380.<br/><br/>Total effort: 161+100=261; +299=560; +130=690; +589=1279; +762=2041; +333=2374; +354=2728; +380=3108. That&#x27;s within limit.<br/><br/>Importance for me: C47:783, A75:461, A30:868, C24:389, B26:808, B11:822, A15:780, A56:668, C26:262. Total: 783+461=1244; +868=2112; +389=2501; +808=3309; +822=4131; +780=4911; +668=5579; +262=5841.<br/><br/>So my initial proposal gives me 5841 importance. The other player&#x27;s proposal gives me 6063, which is higher. But the other player might prefer the second set because it might be better for them, but for me, it&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can make a better proposal by adjusting some items to increase my importance without increasing effort too much.<br/><br/>Looking at the items, maybe I can swap some lower-importance items in my initial set for higher ones. For example, in the other player&#x27;s proposal, they swapped C26 (effort 380, importance 262 for me) for A39 (effort 420, importance 484 for me). So that swap increased my importance by 484-262=222 but increased effort by 40. Since effort was 3108 initially, adding 40 makes it 3148, which is still under 3218.<br/><br/>So in the other&#x27;s proposal, their set gives me 6063, which is higher than my initial 5841, so it&#x27;s better for me to accept. But I need to see if I can get even more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can make a different swap. Let me see which items are not included and could add more importance.<br/><br/>Looking at the effort limit: 3218. Current effort after their proposal is 3148, leaving 70 unused. Could I add another small item?<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items: A19 (effort 919, too big), B91 (852, too big), C75 (205, but importance 65), A47 (534, but high effort), A15 is already included, etc. Maybe C75 (effort 205) is possible? Adding it would require effort 3148+205=3353, leaving 3218-3353=-135, which is over. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I can remove an item with low importance and replace it with a higher one, but that&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can think of items with high importance per effort. For me, looking at importance per effort:<br/><br/>- A30:868/299≈2.9<br/>- B11:822/762≈1.08<br/>- C47:783/161≈4.86<br/>- A15:780/333≈2.34<br/>- A56:668/354≈1.89<br/>- B26:808/589≈1.37<br/>- A75:461/100≈4.61<br/>- C24:389/130≈2.99<br/>- A39:484/420≈1.15<br/>- C26:262/380≈0.69<br/>- A47:508/534≈0.95<br/>- B91:583/852≈0.68<br/>- C75:65/205≈0.317<br/>- C73:121/399≈0.303<br/>- A19:138/919≈0.150<br/>- A39:484/420≈1.15<br/><br/>High importance per effort items: C47 (4.86), A75 (4.61), C24(2.99), A30(2.9), A15(2.34), A56(1.89), B26(1.37), etc.<br/><br/>In the other&#x27;s proposal, they added A39 and removed C26. C26 has low importance per effort (0.69), so that&#x27;s a good swap for me since A39 gives higher importance and better per effort.<br/><br/>So their proposal is better for me. I should consider agreeing but maybe try to negotiate further.<br/><br/>Is there any way to include more high-value items? Let me see if there&#x27;s a way to include C47 and A75, which are top in per effort. Both are already included.<br/><br/>Perhaps we can consider swapping some lower items for higher ones. For example, B11 has effort 762 and importance 822. If I remove it, I can add two items: let&#x27;s see, total effort after removal would be 3148-762=2386. Then I can add items that sum to 762.<br/><br/>Wait, but the limit is 3218, so removing B11 (762) would leave me with 3218 - (3148-762) = 3218 -2386=832. So I can add items up to 832 effort. What can I add to improve my total importance?<br/><br/>Looking for high importance per effort items not already included: A47 (508/534), B91(583/852), A39 already included, C75 (65/205), A19(138/919). Not much. Alternatively, perhaps including A47 and C75: 534+205=739, which is under 832. A47 importance is 508, C75 is 65. But B11&#x27;s importance is 822, which is higher than 508+65=573, so it&#x27;s better to keep B11.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps swapping B11 with multiple items? Let me see: 762 effort could be replaced with, say, A47 (534) and C75 (205). That&#x27;s 739, freeing up 23 effort, which isn&#x27;t enough for another item. But the total importance would be 508+65=573 vs B11&#x27;s 822. So worse for me.<br/><br/>So it&#x27;s better to keep B11.<br/><br/>Another idea: Perhaps swap A56 (effort 354, importance 668) with something else. If I remove A56, I have 3148-354=2794. I could add items up to 3218-2794=424 effort. What can I add? Let&#x27;s see: A39 is already in. A47 (534) is too big. B91 is 852. C47 is already included. C73 is 399, which is within 424. But my importance for C73 is 121, which is lower than A56&#x27;s 668. So that&#x27;s worse. So better to keep A56.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe swap A39 for something else? A39 has effort 420 and importance 484. What if I remove A39 and add two items? The freed effort is 420, so can add up to that. Maybe A56 (354) is already included, but wait, adding A56 would require that I have it, which I do. Alternatively, perhaps swap A39 for a higher importance item. But looking at remaining items, no higher ones are available.<br/><br/>So perhaps the current proposal is the best. Since their proposal gives me higher importance than my initial, I might as well agree. But I should make sure that the effort is correct.<br/><br/>Wait, total effort for their proposal: C47(161)+A75(100)+A30(299)+C24(130)+B26(589)+B11(762)+A15(333)+A56(354)+A39(420) = let&#x27;s add them step by step:<br/><br/>161+100=261; +299=560; +130=690; +589=1279; +762=2041; +333=2374; +354=2728; +420=3148. Correct, under 3218.<br/><br/>Importance: 783+461=1244; +868=2112; +389=2501; +808=3309; +822=4131; +780=4911; +668=5579; +484=6063. That seems solid.<br/><br/>I think this is a good deal for me, so I should agree to it.<br/></p>
