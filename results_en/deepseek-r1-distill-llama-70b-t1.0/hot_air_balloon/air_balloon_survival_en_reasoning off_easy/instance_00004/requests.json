            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing this negotiation game where I have to work with another participant to select a set of items. The goal is to maximize my own total importance while keeping the total effort within the limit of 3389. Each item has an effort value and an importance value, but I can't see the other person's importance scores. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which items are high in importance to me but don't consume too much effort, or maybe some that are high in both but worth including. I should list out all the items with their effort and importance from my perspective to see which ones stand out.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n- A19: Effort 767, Importance 138\n- B91: Effort 533, Importance 583\n- A30: Effort 514, Importance 868\n- B11: Effort 9, Importance 822\n- C47: Effort 539, Importance 783\n- C75: Effort 125, Importance 65\n- C26: Effort 153, Importance 262\n- C73: Effort 325, Importance 121\n- A47: Effort 937, Importance 508\n- A15: Effort 745, Importance 780\n- A75: Effort 334, Importance 461\n- A39: Effort 804, Importance 484\n- A56: Effort 336, Importance 668\n- C24: Effort 587, Importance 389\n- B26: Effort 71, Importance 808\n\nLooking at these, I should prioritize items where the importance per unit effort is highest. That way, I get the most importance without using too much effort.\n\nCalculating importance per effort for each:\n\n- A19: 138/767 ≈ 0.18\n- B91: 583/533 ≈ 1.09\n- A30: 868/514 ≈ 1.69\n- B11: 822/9 ≈ 91.33\n- C47: 783/539 ≈ 1.45\n- C75: 65/125 = 0.52\n- C26: 262/153 ≈ 1.71\n- C73: 121/325 ≈ 0.372\n- A47: 508/937 ≈ 0.542\n- A15: 780/745 ≈ 1.047\n- A75: 461/334 ≈ 1.38\n- A39: 484/804 ≈ 0.602\n- A56: 668/336 ≈ 1.988\n- C24: 389/587 ≈ 0.663\n- B26: 808/71 ≈ 11.38\n\nWow, some of these have really high importance per effort. B11 and B26 are top here, especially B26 with 11.38? That's huge. So including those would be a priority. \n\nBut B11 only takes 9 effort and is very high in importance. So I should definitely include B11. Similarly, B26 is next with 71 effort, which is also manageable.\n\nLooking at B11 and B26 together: 9 + 71 = 80 effort. So that's minimal effort for a lot of importance.\n\nNext, A30 has a high ratio of 1.69. It's also high in absolute importance, so it's a good candidate. A30's effort is 514. So adding that would bring total effort to 80 + 514 = 594. Still way below 3389.\n\nNext, A56 has a ratio of 1.988, better than A30. So maybe include A56 next. Wait, A56's effort is 336. Adding that would bring total effort to 594 + 336 = 930. Still low.\n\nBut let me check their absolute importance. B11 is 822, B26 is 808, A30 is 868, A56 is 668. So total importance so far is 822+808+868+668 = 3266. But effort is 9+71+514+336 = 930.\n\nThis is good, but there's room for more. What's next? Let's see. C47 has 1.45, which is the next highest. C47's effort is 539. Adding that would bring effort to 930 + 539 = 1469. Still a lot of room left.\n\nC47's importance is 783, so total importance becomes 3266 + 783 = 4049. Still, effort is 1469. What else?\n\nThen A15: ratio 1.047, effort 745. If I add that, effort becomes 1469 + 745 = 2214. Room left: 3389 - 2214 = 1175. Importance would be 4049 + 780 = 4829.\n\nNext, perhaps C26 with ratio 1.71, effort 153. Adding that: 2214 + 153 = 2367. Importance: 4829 + 262 = 5091.\n\nOr maybe A75 (ratio 1.38), effort 334. That would add 334 to 2367, making 2701. Importance increases by 461: 5091 + 461 = 5552.\n\nAlternatively, C47 was already included. Let's see, what's left? Maybe B91, which has a ratio of 1.09, but higher absolute importance. Its effort is 533.\n\nAlternatively, A39: ratio 0.602, which is low. Maybe A19: 0.18, which is very low. So probably not worth including. C24: 0.663, also low. Maybe C73: 0.372, also low.\n\nWait, so after including B11, B26, A30, A56, C47, A15, C26, A75, let's check the total effort:\n\n9 + 71 + 514 + 336 + 539 + 745 + 153 + 334 = Let's calculate step by step:\n\nStart with 9+71 = 80\n80+514=594\n594+336=930\n930+539=1469\n1469+745=2214\n2214+153=2367\n2367+334=2701.\n\nThat leaves 3389 - 2701 = 688 effort remaining.\n\nWhat's left in terms of items? Let's see:\n\nA19: 767 (too much), A47:937 (also too much). B91:533, but I have 688 left. So 533, that's possible. Adding B91: effort 533, which would bring total to 2701 + 533 = 3234, leaving 3389 - 3234 = 155. Are there any items with effort <=155 that we haven't included yet?\n\nLooking back: C75 (125), C73 (325, which is too big), C26 (153). Wait, C26 is already included. So C75 is 125, which we haven't included yet. So adding B91 (533) and C75 (125) would require 533 + 125 = 658, but the remaining effort after B91 is 155, so 125 fits. So:\n\nAfter B91, add C75: total effort 3234 + 125 = 3359. Remaining: 30. Any items with effort <=30? Looking back, the smallest is B11 (9), but it's already included. So no more items can be added.\n\nSo total effort would be 3359, within the limit.\n\nBut let's check the total importance:\n\nB11:822, B26:808, A30:868, A56:668, C47:783, A15:780, C26:262, A75:461, B91:583, C75:65.\n\nAdding these up:\n\n822 + 808 = 1630\n1630 + 868 = 2498\n2498 + 668 = 3166\n3166 + 783 = 3949\n3949 + 780 = 4729\n4729 +262=4991\n4991 +461=5452\n5452 +583=6035\n6035 +65=6100.\n\nThat's a total importance of 6100. But we might be able to do better by adjusting the items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps swapping some items. For example, if we skip A15 (effort 745) and include other items instead. Let's see:\n\nIf we don't take A15, we save 745 effort, which could allow us to include more smaller items. For example, A15 is 745, but maybe adding multiple smaller ones.\n\nWait, what's the total effort without A15: 2701 -745=1956. Then adding B91 (533) brings it to 1956 +533=2489. Then add C75 (125) to 2489+125=2614. Still, we have 3389 -2614=775 left.\n\nWith 775, could we add more? Let's see. Maybe A56 is already included, but A30, etc. Maybe A39 is 804, which is more than 775, so no. How about A75 is 334, which is already included. C47 is already added. Maybe C24:587, which is within 775.\n\nSo adding C24:587. Now total effort 2614 +587=3201. Remaining effort: 3389-3201=188. Any items with effort <=188? Let's see: C73 is 325, which is over. C26:153 is already included. B26 is already included. Maybe C75 is added. Wait, C75 is 125, already included. So maybe none.\n\nAlternatively, instead of C24, perhaps A47:937 is over. So maybe no.\n\nSo the total importance in this scenario would be:\n\n822 +808 +868 +668 +783 +262 +461 +583 +125 = let's calculate:\n\n822+808=1630\n1630+868=2498\n2498+668=3166\n3166+783=3949\n3949+262=4211\n4211+461=4672\n4672+583=5255\n5255+125=5380.\n\nThat's less than the previous total of 6100. So including A15 gives a better total. So maybe better to keep A15.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, we had 6100, which is higher. So perhaps that's better.\n\nAlternatively, what if we don't include C26 (153) and instead use that effort elsewhere? Let's see:\n\nIf we remove C26 (effort 153), we can add 153 effort elsewhere. Are there items with combined effort 153? Maybe C75 (125) and leave the rest? Or perhaps nothing else, since C75 is already included. So perhaps that's not beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe including C73 (effort 325) instead of C26 (153). Let's see:\n\nRemoving C26 (153) and adding C73 (325). Net effort change: +172. So total effort would go from 2701 to 2701 -153 +325=2873. Then, when adding B91 and C75, which adds 533 +125=658. Total effort becomes 2873 +533 +125=3531. But the limit is 3389, which is exceeded by 142. So that's not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the initial plan is better.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps including A47 (effort 937). Let me see if that's possible. If I include A47, that's 937 effort. Let's see how much that would affect the total.\n\nIncluding A47 in the initial set: B11, B26, A30, A56, C47, A15, C26, A75, B91, C75. But wait, A47 is 937, so adding that would require removing some items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including A47 instead of one of the lower importance items. For example, if we remove C75 (125) and include A47 (937), the effort would change by 937 -125=812. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nInitially, without A47 but with C75, the total effort is 3359. If we do this swap, effort becomes 3359 -125 +937=4171, which is way over the limit. So not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps excluding A15 (745) and including A47. Let's see:\n\nCurrent effort without A15: 2701 -745=1956. Adding B91 (533) brings it to 1956+533=2489. Adding A47 (937) brings it to 2489+937=3426, which is over by 3426 -3389=37. Close, but over. So we need to reduce by 37.\n\nIs there an item we can remove to make up for 37? Let's see. For example, C75 is 125, but removing it would save 125, making effort 3426 -125=3301, which is within limit. So the set would be: B11, B26, A30, A56, C47, B91, A47, C75 (no, wait, we removed C75), so the set is B11, B26, A30, A56, C47, B91, A47. Their total effort: 9+71+514+336+539+533+937= Let's add:\n\n9+71=80\n80+514=594\n594+336=930\n930+539=1469\n1469+533=2002\n2002+937=2939.\n\nWait, that's less than 3389. So we have 3389-2939=450 left. What else can we add? Maybe C75 (125) and C24 (587), but 125+587=712, which is too much. Alternatively, C75 (125) and C26 (153): 125+153=278. Adding both would bring effort to 2939 +278=3217, still leaving 3389-3217=172. Is there an item with effort <=172? C73 is 325, which is too big. C24 is 587. A39 is 804. So nothing else can be added. So the total effort would be 3217.\n\nImportance in this scenario: B11:822, B26:808, A30:868, A56:668, C47:783, B91:583, A47:508. Plus C75:65 and C26:262 if we include them. So total importance:\n\n822+808+868+668+783+583+508+65+262= Let's add:\n\n822+808=1630\n1630+868=2498\n2498+668=3166\n3166+783=3949\n3949+583=4532\n4532+508=5040\n5040+65=5105\n5105+262=5367.\n\nThat's less than the initial 6100, so not optimal.\n\nTherefore, the initial plan of including B11, B26, A30, A56, C47, A15, C26, A75, B91, C75, totaling 6100 importance and 3359 effort, seems better. Let me check the effort again:\n\nB11:9\nB26:71\nA30:514\nA56:336\nC47:539\nA15:745\nC26:153\nA75:334\nB91:533\nC75:125.\n\nEffort sum: 9+71=80; 80+514=594; 594+336=930; 930+539=1469; 1469+745=2214; 2214+153=2367; 2367+334=2701; 2701+533=3234; 3234+125=3359. Yes, correct.\n\nNow, can I make this into a proposal? But perhaps I can check if I can add more items. Wait, there's a remaining effort of 3389 -3359=30. So 30 effort left. The only item with effort <=30 is B11, which is already included. So no more items can be added.\n\nSo my initial proposal would include these 10 items. Alternatively, maybe I can add another item by swapping a high-effort item with a lower one. For example, C47 takes 539, perhaps swap it with a combination of smaller items. Let's see, if I remove C47 (effort 539), I have 539 extra to use.\n\nWhat can I add with 539? Maybe B91 (533) and C75 (125), but 533+125=658, which is over 539. Alternatively, B91 alone is 533, and I can add someone else with 6, but no such item. Alternatively, A39 is 804, which is over. So including B91 is possible, but it's already in the proposal. So in this case, it's better to keep C47 as it gives 783 importance for 539 effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swapping C47 (539) with C24 (587) and C26 (153), but that's 587+153=740, which is more effort than C47's 539. So not better.\n\nTherefore, the initial proposal is the best I can think of.\n\nSo, the set would be {'B11', 'B26', 'A30', 'A56', 'C47', 'A15', 'C26', 'A75', 'B91', 'C75'}.\n\nWait, but let's check if that exceeds the effort:\n\n9+71=80\n80+514=594\n594+336=930\n930+539=1469\n1469+745=2214\n2214+153=2367\n2367+334=2701\n2701+533=3234\n3234+125=3359. Yes, correct.\n\nTotal importance is 6100.\n\nNow, if I can include A15, which is high importance, it's better to keep. \n\nSo I should propose this set. But since the other player might have different priorities, I need to also think about possible counter-proposals. Maybe they value C items higher, so they might suggest a different combination. So I need to be ready to negotiate, perhaps swap some items if needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other player suggests a different set, and I can argue why mine is better. But since I don't know their priorities, it's a bit tricky.\n\nSo, to start, I should make this proposal. Let's see:\n\nThe set is: B11, B26, A30, A56, C47, A15, C26, A75, B91, C75.\n\nEffort: 3359, which is under the limit.\n\nImportance to me: 6100.\n\nSo, that's my initial PROPOSAL.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I just received a refusal from the other participant. They sent me a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT, but apparently, my response didn't include the ARGUMENT structure properly. Hmm, I need to fix that.\n\nFirst, I should read through the rules again to make sure I understand what’s expected. It says I must include the ARGUMENT format at least once in my messages. So, in my next move, I need to make sure I add that.\n\nLooking at the previous PROPOSAL they made, it includes several items. Let me calculate the total effort for that proposal to see if it fits within the limit. \n\nThe items in their proposal are: B11, B91, B26, C47, A30, A56, A15, C26, A75, C75.\n\nI need to look up each of these items' efforts:\n\n- B11: 9\n- B91: 533\n- B26: 71\n- C47: 539\n- A30: 514\n- A56: 336\n- A15: 745\n- C26: 153\n- A75: 334\n- C75: 125\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 533 = 542. 542 +71=613. 613+539=1152. +514=1666. +336=2002. +745=2747. +153=2900. +334=3234. +125=3359. Wait, that's 3359, which is over the 3389 limit. Oh, no, actually, wait: 3359 is below 3389. Wait, 3389 is the limit, and 3359 is under that, so maybe it's acceptable. Hmm, perhaps I should verify the math.\n\nWait, let me add them again:\n\nB11:9, B91:533 → 542\nB26:71 → 613\nC47:539 → 1152\nA30:514 → 1666\nA56:336 → 2002\nA15:745 → 2747\nC26:153 → 2900\nA75:334 →3234\nC75:125 →3359\n\nSo total effort is 3359, which is under 3389. So their proposal is within the limit.\n\nBut why did I refuse it? Maybe because their selection doesn't maximize my personal importance. Let me check which items are included and how they align with my values.\n\nMy importance values are:\n\nA19:138, B91:583, A30:868, B11:822, C47:783, C75:65, C26:262, C73:121, A47:508, A15:780, A75:461, A39:484, A56:668, C24:389, B26:808.\n\nSo, in their proposal, they include B11 (importance 822), B91 (583), B26 (808), C47 (783), A30 (868), A56 (668), A15 (780), C26 (262), A75 (461), C75 (65).\n\nLet me sum my importance for these items:\n\n822 (B11) +583 (B91) +808 (B26) +783 (C47) +868 (A30) +668 (A56) +780 (A15) +262 (C26) +461 (A75) +65 (C75).\n\nCalculating: \n\nStart with 822 + 583 = 1405\n+808 =2213\n+783=3000- we're at 2996\n+868=3864\n+668=4532\n+780=5312\n+262=5574\n+461=6035\n+65=6100.\n\nSo their proposal gives me a total importance of 6100.\n\nIs that good for me? Maybe, but perhaps I can get a better deal.\n\nI need to propose a different set that gives me higher total importance while keeping effort under 3389.\n\nAlternatively, I can adjust the set to swap some items to get higher importance for me, while not exceeding the effort limit.\n\nLooking at their proposal, items like B11 (effort 9, importance 822) and B26 (71, 808) are high-value, low-effort, so I want to keep those. Similarly, A15 (745 effort, 780 importance) and A30 (514,868) are valuable.\n\nPerhaps I can add more high-importance items and see if the effort stays under.\n\nWait, let's see the total effort in their proposal is 3359, so we have 3389-3359=30 left. Maybe we can swap some low-importance, high-effort items with higher importance, lower effort ones.\n\nLooking at their proposal, C75 has effort 125 and importance 65. That's a low importance, so maybe we can remove it and add something else with higher importance but low effort.\n\nBut what's left? The items not in their proposal are A19, C24, C73, A47, A39, A56 is included, A75 is included. Wait, A56 is in their proposal, so the remaining items are A19 (effort 767, importance 138), C24 (587, 389), C73 (325, 121), A47 (937,508), A39 (804,484).\n\nLooking at these, perhaps A47 has high effort but not too high importance. C24 has moderate effort and moderate importance. C73 is low effort but low importance as well.\n\nWait, if we remove C75 (effort 125, importance 65) from their proposal, that frees up 125 effort. What else can we add without exceeding the limit?\n\nLooking for items not in the current proposal, with as high importance as possible. The next highest importance in the remaining items is A19:138, which is lower than C75's 65, but maybe swapping isn't beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for items not in the proposal with higher importance and see if adding them is possible.\n\nWait, A47 has importance 508, which is higher than C75's 65. If I remove C75 (effort 125) and add A47 (effort 937), that would require effort to decrease by 125 and increase by 937, a net increase of 812. Since the total effort allowed is 3389 and the current is 3359, adding 812 would exceed. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps removing a higher effort item. For example, A15 has effort 745 and importance 780. If we remove A15, that frees up 745, allowing us to add multiple items.\n\nSo, if we remove A15 and C75, that frees up 745 + 125 = 870. Then, perhaps add C24 (587) and C73 (325), but that would total effort 587+325=912, which is more than 870, so that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe add A47 (937), which alone uses 937, which would be more than 870. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Instead of removing A15, maybe remove a smaller effort item.\n\nLooking at the proposal, C75 is 125, but maybe another low-effort item, like B11 (9). But B11 has high importance, so removing it would lower my total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps keep B11 but adjust other items.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to suggest a different set that includes more of my high-importance items, even if they have higher effort, as long as the total is under 3389.\n\nLet me try to build a proposal that includes as many high-importance items as possible.\n\nLooking at my importance:\n\nHighest importance items are:\n\nB26: 808\n\nB91: 583\n\nA15:780\n\nA30:868\n\nB11:822\n\nC47:783\n\nA56:668\n\nB26 is highest, then B91, then A15, A30, etc.\n\nSo, let me try building a set including these.\n\nStart with B26 (71), B91 (533), B11 (9), A30 (514), A15 (745), C47 (539). Let's add these:\n\nEfforts:71+533=604+9=613+514=1127+745=1872+539=2411.\n\nTotal so far:2411, leaving 3389-2411=978 left.\n\nNow, what's next in importance? C26:262, A75:461, A56:668, C24:389, and so on.\n\nLooking for high importance. A56 is 668 effort, which is manageable if 978-668=310 left. Then, can we add more?\n\nAdding A56: total effort becomes 2411+668=3079, leaving 3389-3079=310.\n\nNow, what's left? C26:153, C24:587 (too big, 587>310). C75:125. C73:325 (too big). So, maybe add C26 (153) and C75 (125): 153+125=278, which is under 310.\n\nSo total effort would be 3079+278=3357, leaving 32.\n\nSo the set would be:\n\nB26, B91, B11, A30, A15, C47, A56, C26, C75.\n\nIs this better for me? Let's calculate my importance:\n\nB26:808\n\nB91:583\n\nB11:822\n\nA30:868\n\nA15:780\n\nC47:783\n\nA56:668\n\nC26:262\n\nC75:65\n\nTotal: 808+583=1391+822=2213+868=3081+780=3861+783=4644+668=5312+262=5574+65=5639.\n\nThat's a higher total than their proposal of 6100? Wait, no, 5639 vs 6100? Wait, no, 5639 is less than 6100? Wait, wait, let me check.\n\nWait, their proposal gave me 6100 as my total importance. So my new proposal would give me 5639, which is worse. So that's not better for me.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the total importance for my proposed set.\n\nB26:808, B91:583, B11:822, A30:868, A15:780, C47:783, A56:668, C26:262, C75:65.\n\nAdding them: 808+583=1391 +822=2213 +868=3081 +780=3861 +783=4644 +668=5312 +262=5574 +65=5639.\n\nYes, 5639. Their proposal gives me 6100, which is better for me. So my previous attempt is worse.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Maybe include more of their high-importance items if it helps me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to make a proposal that includes A47, which has high effort but also considerable importance.\n\nWait, A47 has effort 937 and importance 508. Let me see if including it would help.\n\nIf I include A47, I need to remove some items with high effort to compensate.\n\nIn their current proposal, A15 has effort 745. If I replace A15 with A47, the effort increases by 937-745=192. So the total effort would go from 3359 to 3359 -745 +937=3359 +192=3551, which is still under 3389? Wait no, 3551 is over 3389 by 162. So that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, replace A15 (745) and another item. Maybe A15 and C75 (125). Effort freed: 745+125=870. Adding A47 (937) would require 870-937= -67, so effort goes up by 67, total becomes 3359 -870 +937= 3359 +67=3426, which is over.\n\nNot good. Alternatively, remove more items. Maybe A15, C75, and another item. Let's say A15(745), C75(125), and B11(9): total 879. Then add A47(937): effort would be 3359 -879 +937= 3359 +58=3417, still over.\n\nNot helpful. Alternatively, maybe look for other high-importance items that are not in the proposal.\n\nWait, maybe include A39 (effort 804, importance 484). Let me see if I can add it.\n\nBut again, need to remove items to compensate. Let's see, in their proposal, maybe remove A15 (745) and C75 (125). So 745+125=870. Adding A39 (804) would require 804, so net effort reduction: 870-804=66. So total effort becomes 3359-870+804=3293. Then, I have 3293. Maybe I can add something else.\n\nWhat else is left? Let me check items not in the proposal: A19, C24, C73, A47.\n\nIf I add A39, I can then see what's left. Effort used would be 3359-870+804=3293. The effort left is 3389-3293=96. So I can add items with up to 96 effort. A19 is 767, too big. C24:587, too big. C73:325, too big. A47:937, too big. So only C73 is too big. So perhaps no other items can be added.\n\nAlternatively, in addition to A39, replace A15 and C75, and perhaps include another small item. But I think it's getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps accept their proposal but suggest a small tweak. Since their proposal gives me 6100, which is better than my alternative, but maybe I can get more by swapping an item.\n\nWait, in their proposal, they include C75 (effort 125, importance 65). I can try to replace that with an item that gives me higher importance.\n\nSo, if I remove C75 (effort 125, importance 65), I can add another item not in the proposal that has higher importance and effort ≤125.\n\nLooking at remaining items: A19 (effort 767, too big), C24 (587, too big), C73 (325, too big), A47 (937, too big). So nothing can be added without exceeding effort. So maybe I can just remove C75 and get a slightly higher importance by freeing up effort.\n\nWait, but if I remove C75, my total importance drops by 65, but maybe I can't add anything else. So no benefit. So perhaps their proposal is acceptable.\n\nBut since I refused it, perhaps I should propose a different set that gives me more, even if it uses similar effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe keep their proposal as a base and adjust one or two items to improve my total.\n\nWait, maybe I can swap C75 (125,65) with C24 (587,389). But that would add 587-125=462 effort, making total effort 3359-125+587=3821, which is way over 3389. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swap multiple items. For example, remove C75 (125,65) and add C24 (587,389). That's a net increase of 462, which is too much. Alternatively, remove another high-effort item to compensate.\n\nWait, in their proposal, A15 has effort 745. If I remove A15 and C75 (745+125=870), and add C24 (587) and maybe another item. 587 + x ≤870. But I can't add much else. Maybe C24 and C73 (325). Total effort: 587+325=912. 912-870=42, so total effort becomes 3359-870+912=3359+42=3401, which is over the limit.\n\nAlternatively, remove A15, C75, and B26 (71), freeing up 745+125+71=941. Then add C24 (587) and C73 (325): 587+325=912, which is under 941. Then total effort would be 3359-941+912=3359-29=3330, which is under the limit. The importance would be:\n\nRemove A15 (780), C75 (65), B26 (808). Add C24 (389), C73 (121). So net change: -780-65-808 +389+121 = (-1653) + 510 = -1143. So my total importance goes down by 1143, which is worse. So that's not a good trade.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove A15, C75, and B91 (533), freeing up 745+125+533=1403. Then add A47 (937), C24 (587), and maybe another small item. Total effort added: 937+587=1524, which is 1524-1403=121 over. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, remove A15 and C75 (745+125=870), and add A47 (937) only. Then total effort would be 3359-870+937=3359+67=3426, which is over.\n\nSo, perhaps swapping isn't beneficial unless I can find items that add more importance without overshooting effort.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just accept their proposal, as any changes I make either don't improve my total or push the effort over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a different combination that includes some items not in their proposal but gives me a higher total.\n\nLet me try building from scratch.\n\nStart with B26 (71,808) - must include.\n\nB91 (533,583) - include.\n\nB11 (9,822) - include.\n\nA30 (514,868) - include.\n\nC47 (539,783) - include.\n\nNow, total effort so far: 71+533=604+9=613+514=1127+539=1666.\n\nEffort left: 3389-1666=1723.\n\nNow, what's next in importance: A15 (780), which is high. Let's include that. Effort:1666+745=2411. Left: 3389-2411=978.\n\nNext, A56 (336,668). Include. Effort:2411+336=2747. Left: 3389-2747=642.\n\nNext, A75 (334,461). Include. Effort:2747+334=3081. Left:3389-3081=308.\n\nNow, what's left: C26 (153,262), C24 (587,389), C73 (325,121), A19 (767,138), A47 (937,508), A39 (804,484).\n\nLooking for high importance items that fit in 308.\n\nC24:587 is too big. A39:804 too big. A47:937 too big. C73:325. Let's include that. Effort:3081+325=3406, which is over. Wait, no, 3081+325=3406>3389. So can't include C73.\n\nC26:153. Include that: Effort 3081+153=3234. Left: 3389-3234=155.\n\nLeftover items: none can fit except C75 (125,65). Include that: 3234+125=3359. Left:30.\n\nNo more items left except A19, but it's too big.\n\nSo total items: B26, B91, B11, A30, C47, A15, A56, A75, C26, C75.\n\nWait, let's check effort:\n\nB26:71, B91:533, B11:9, A30:514, C47:539, A15:745, A56:336, A75:334, C26:153, C75:125.\n\nAdding these:\n\n71+533=604+9=613+514=1127+539=1666+745=2411+336=2747+334=3081+153=3234+125=3359.\n\nEffort total:3359, same as their proposal.\n\nImportance total: B26:808, B91:583, B11:822, A30:868, C47:783, A15:780, A56:668, A75:461, C26:262, C75:65.\n\nAdding:808+583=1391+822=2213+868=3081+783=3864+780=4644+668=5312+461=5773+262=6035+65=6100.\n\nSame as their proposal. So, same result but different items. So perhaps it's better to stick with their proposal, but since I refused it before, I need to make a better offer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can remove C75 and add another item, but as calculated before, nothing else fits, so the total would decrease.\n\nWait, maybe include A39 instead of C75. Let's see.\n\nIn their proposal, C75 is included. If I remove it, I free 125, but can't add A39 (804>125). So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, remove both C75 and another item to add A39.\n\nFor example, remove C75 (125) and A75 (334). Total free:459. Add A39 (804): can't, 459<804.\n\nAlternatively, remove A75 and C75: 334+125=459. Can't add A39.\n\nAlternatively, remove A75 and C75 and B26 (71): total 334+125+71=530. Then add A39 (804): 804>530. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different combination.\n\nI think it's getting too convoluted. Maybe the original proposal is the best option, giving me 6100. Since I can't find a better set, perhaps I should accept it, but I need to negotiate better terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps propose adding A47. But as calculated earlier, it's not feasible without exceeding effort.\n\nAlternatively, accept their proposal but argue for a better deal.\n\nWait, perhaps suggest a smaller change, like swapping C75 with a zero-effort item, but there are no items with zero effort.\n\nAlternatively, accept their proposal, as any further changes don't improve my total.\n\nSo, perhaps send AGREE, but the user can't do that immediately. Alternatively, make a counterproposal.\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial response, I need to include an ARGUMENT, as the user pointed out.\n\nSo, perhaps my message should be a PROPOSAL with a different set, along with an ARGUMENT.\n\nSo, what's my strategy? Maybe propose a set that includes more of my high-importance items.\n\nLet me try to make a proposal that includes B26, B91, B11, A30, C47, A15, A56, C26, C75, but swap A15 with A39.\n\nWait, A15 has effort 745, A39 has 804. So swapping would require adding 59 more effort (804-745=59). So the total effort becomes 3359 -745 +804=3359+59=3418>3389. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, replace A15 and another item to compensate.\n\nHmm, perhaps remove A15 and C75, then add A39 and another small item.\n\nA15:745, C75:125 → total 870. Add A39:804 and perhaps C73:325, but 804+325=1129, which is 259 more than 870. So, 3359-870+1129=3359+259=3618>3389. No.\n\nAlternatively, remove A15 (745), C75 (125), B11 (9): total 879. Add A39 (804), and C73 (325). 804+325=1129, which is 250 more than 879. So total effort:3359-879+1129=3359+250=3609>3389. Still over.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remove more items. For example, remove A15 (745), A75 (334), and C75 (125): total 1204. Add A39 (804) and A47 (937): 804+937=1741, which is more than 1204 by 537. So total effort becomes 3359-1204+1741=3359+537=3896>3389. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, accept that it's difficult to find a better set and perhaps propose their set but ask for a small change.\n\nAlternatively, make a PROPOSAL with a different set and argue why it's better.\n\nSo, perhaps make a PROPOSAL: {'B11', 'B91', 'B26', 'C47', 'A30', 'A56', 'A15', 'C26', 'C75'}.\n\nWait, but that's their proposal minus A75. Let me recalculate the effort:\n\nB11:9, B91:533, B26:71, C47:539, A30:514, A56:336, A15:745, C26:153, C75:125.\n\nEffort total:9+533=542+71=613+539=1152+514=1666+336=2002+745=2747+153=2900+125=3025.\n\nWait, that's only 3025, well under 3389. So, perhaps I can add more items.\n\nWhat else can I add? Available items: A19, C24, C73, A47, A39, A75.\n\nA75 is effort 334, so adding that: total becomes 3025+334=3359. Then, include A75.\n\nSo, total set: B11, B91, B26, C47, A30, A56, A15, C26, C75, A75. Wait, that's same as their original proposal, giving me 6100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps leaving A75 out and adding something else.\n\nWait, without A75, I have 3025, and can add, say, C24 (587), but 3025+587=3612>3389. No. Or C73 (325): 3025+325=3350, leaving 39. Not enough for anything else.\n\nSo, perhaps add A75 and nothing else, making the proposal same as theirs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include more items by removing some lower importance ones.\n\nWait, maybe remove C75 (125) and add C73 (325). Effort changes: 125→325, so +200. Total effort:3359-125+325=3359+200=3559>3389. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, remove C75 and C26 (153) and add C73 and A19 (767). Total effort: 125+153=278 removed, 325+767=1092 added, net 814. So 3359-278+1092=3359+814=4173>3389. No.\n\nAlternatively, remove multiple items to compensate.\n\nWait, perhaps remove C26 (153) and C75 (125), freeing 278, and add C24 (587). Then effort becomes 3359-278+587=3359+309=3668>3389. No.\n\nI think it's clear that their proposal is the most efficient in terms of effort, giving me the highest possible importance. So, perhaps it's best to accept it.\n\nBut since I already refused it, I need to make a better offer.\n\nAlternatively, propose the same set and argue for it.\n\nSo, in my next message, I will make a PROPOSAL with the same set, and include an ARGUMENT explaining why it's beneficial.\n\nBut perhaps the user might not accept a repeated proposal. Alternatively, adjust one item to show willingness to negotiate.\n\nWait, perhaps remove C75 (125,65) and add A19 (767,138). Effort goes from 3359 to 3359-125+767=3359+642=39991? Wait, 3359-125=3234 +767=4001>3389. No.\n\nAlternatively, remove C75 and add nothing, making effort 3234, allowing me to say it's under limit.\n\nBut that gives me 6100-65=6035, which is worse.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to accept the original proposal and end the negotiation.\n\nSo, in my response, I should include a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT.\n\nBut considering the time I've spent, perhaps the best move is to accept their proposal by sending AGREE, but I don't know if that's allowed since the user instructions said I can only AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player, and the game ends when one side agrees to the other's proposal.\n\nSo, perhaps I should accept their proposal.\n\nBut the user here is me, so in the initial response, I think I need to make a counterproposal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'll propose my own set and argue why it's better.\n\nSo, my proposal would be: {'B11', 'B91', 'B26', 'C47', 'A30', 'A15', 'A56', 'C26', 'C75', 'A75'}, same as theirs.\n\nBut in my initial proposal, I need to argue why this is better.\n\nWait, in my next message, I should include a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT.\n\nSo, to meet the requirement, I'll think of a new proposal that slightly adjusts theirs but keeps my importance higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include one more high-importance item.\n\nWait, perhaps include A39 instead of A75.\n\nSo, remove A75 (334,461) and include A39 (804,484). Effort changes: 334→804, +470. Total effort becomes 3359+470=3829>3389. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, remove another item to compensate.\n\nRemove A75 (334) and A15 (745), total 1079. Add A39 (804) and maybe A47 (937). 804+937=1741. 1741-1079=662. So total effort:3359-1079+1741=3359+662=4021>3389. No.\n\nAlternatively, remove A15, A75, and C75 (745+334+125=1204). Add A39 (804) and A47 (937). 804+937=1741. 1741-1204=537. Total effort:3359-1204+1741=3359+537=3896>3389.\n\nNo good.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remove A15 (745) and add nothing, freeing 745. So total effort becomes 3359-745=2614. Can I add more items? Let's see, items not in the proposal are A19, C24, C73, A47, A39.\n\nA39:804>2614? No, 804>2614? No, wait, total effort is 2614, adding A39 would make it 2614+804=3418>3389. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A15 and C75 and add A39 and C73.\n\nWait, removing 745+125=870, adding 804+325=1129. So effort becomes 3359-870+1129=3359+259=3618>3389. Not allowed.\n\nI think I've exhausted options. So, perhaps the best is to accept their proposal.\n\nIn summary, I need to make a PROPOSAL along with an ARGUMENT in the response.\n"

Each item has an effort value, and the total effort can't exceed 3389. My goal is to maximize my own importance, which I know, but the other person's is hidden. \n\nSo, the other player sent a PROPOSAL with this set: {'A30', 'A15', 'A56', 'B91', 'B26', 'B11', 'C47', 'C26', 'C73', 'C24'}. I need to respond. \n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of their proposal to see if it's under the limit. Let me add up the efforts:\n\nA30: 514\nA15: 745\nA56: 336\nB91: 533\nB26: 71\nB11: 9\nC47: 539\nC26: 153\nC73: 325\nC24: 587\n\nAdding these up:\n514 + 745 = 1259\n1259 + 336 = 1595\n1595 + 533 = 2128\n2128 + 71 = 2199\n2199 + 9 = 2208\n2208 + 539 = 2747\n2747 + 153 = 2900\n2900 + 325 = 3225\n3225 + 587 = 3812\n\nWait, that's 3812, which is way over the limit of 3389. So their proposal is invalid because it's over the limit. That's a problem. \n\nI need to respond. Since their proposal exceeds the limit, I should refuse it. But I can't just refuse without suggesting something else, or at least explaining why. \n\nI should also make sure to follow the rules. My response needs to include an ARGUMENT in the structured format, explaining why I'm refusing this proposal. I can't just send any text; I have to make sure it's in the correct form.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n1. REFUSE their proposal.\n2. ARGUMENT explaining why—I could point out that it exceeds the effort limit or suggest that it doesn't meet my needs.\n\nWait, but the user needs to make sure their proposal is within the limit, so I can point that out. Alternatively, if they need to adjust, but in this case, the total is over by more than 400, which is significant.\n\nI should make sure my ARGUMENT is in the correct format, with a set of strings, probably just a single string explaining the issue.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nREFUSE: {'A30', 'A15', 'A56', 'B91', 'B26', 'B11', 'C47', 'C26', 'C73', 'C24'}\nARGUMENT: {\"The total effort of this proposal exceeds the limit of 3389.\"}\n\nI need to make sure this is the exact format, with the tags followed by a colon and the content in curly braces, and the argument as a Python set of strings.\n\nI should double-check the effort calculation again to be certain. Let me recalculate:\n\nA30:514\nA15:745 → 514+745=1259\nA56:336 → 1259+336=1595\nB91:533 → 1595+533=2128\nB26:71 → 2128+71=2199\nB11:9 → 2199+9=2208\nC47:539 → 2208+539=2747\nC26:153 → 2747+153=2900\nC73:325 → 2900+325=3225\nC24:587 → 3225+587=3812\n\nYes, that's correct. So the proposal is invalid. I need to make sure I format my response correctly with REFUSE and ARGUMENT.\n"
