    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. Let&#x27;s see. The goal is to maximize my own total importance while staying within the effort limit of 4915. I don&#x27;t know what the other player&#x27;s importance values are, so I need to make strategic choices based on what I can control.<br/><br/>First, I need to list out all the items with their effort and my importance. Let me jot them down:<br/><br/>A19: Effort 463, Importance 138<br/>B91: Effort 287, Importance 583<br/>A30: Effort 492, Importance 868<br/>B11: Effort 466, Importance 822<br/>C47: Effort 935, Importance 783<br/>C75: Effort 373, Importance 65<br/>C26: Effort 950, Importance 262<br/>C73: Effort 760, Importance 121<br/>A47: Effort 994, Importance 508<br/>A15: Effort 390, Importance 780<br/>A75: Effort 836, Importance 461<br/>A39: Effort 911, Importance 484<br/>A56: Effort 948, Importance 668<br/>C24: Effort 81, Importance 389<br/>B26: Effort 945, Importance 808<br/><br/>Now, for each item, I might consider the importance per effort ratio to prioritize which ones give me the most value. Calculating that:<br/><br/>A19: 138/463 ≈ 0.298<br/>B91: 583/287 ≈ 2.031<br/>A30: 868/492 ≈ 1.765<br/>B11: 822/466 ≈ 1.765<br/>C47: 783/935 ≈ 0.837<br/>C75: 65/373 ≈ 0.174<br/>C26: 262/950 ≈ 0.276<br/>C73: 121/760 ≈ 0.159<br/>A47: 508/994 ≈ 0.511<br/>A15: 780/390 ≈ 2.000<br/>A75: 461/836 ≈ 0.552<br/>A39: 484/911 ≈ 0.532<br/>A56: 668/948 ≈ 0.705<br/>C24: 389/81 ≈ 4.802<br/>B26: 808/945 ≈ 0.855<br/><br/>Looking at these ratios, the top ones are C24 at 4.802, A15 at 2.0, B91 and A30 and B11 around 1.7-2.0, then C47, B26, A56, A75, A39, A47, then lower ones like A19, C26, C75, and C73.<br/><br/>If I prioritize based on this, C24 is a must since it&#x27;s high importance and very low effort. Then A15, which has a high importance and manageable effort. B91 is also high. A30 and B11 are next, both with 1.765.<br/><br/>So maybe my initial proposal should include the top items by ratio, making sure the total effort stays under 4915.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s try adding up:<br/><br/>C24 is 81.<br/><br/>A15: 390. Total so far: 471.<br/><br/>B91: 287. Total: 758.<br/><br/>A30: 492. Total: 1250.<br/><br/>B11: 466. Total: 1716.<br/><br/>Now, let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s next. C47 is 935, which would take us to 2651. That&#x27;s still under 4915, so let&#x27;s include C47.<br/><br/>Total now is 1716+935=2651.<br/><br/>Next, A75: 836. 2651+836=3487. Still under.<br/><br/>Then, B26: 945. 3487+945=4432. Still under.<br/><br/>Adding A56: 948 would exceed, since 4432+948=5380&gt;4915. So maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after B26, we have room for a few more. Let&#x27;s see: 4432. Remaining effort: 4915-4432=483.<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort &lt;=483. Next in the ratio is A39:911 is too high. A75:836 is too high. A56:948 is too high. So maybe C73:760 is too high. A47:994 too high. So maybe we can pick C47, but that&#x27;s already included. The next in ratio after B26 is C47 is already in. Then, C26:950 is too high. So perhaps no more can be added.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe after C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, B26, and then see if we can add A56. Let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>C24:81, A15:390, B91:287, A30:492, B11:466, C47:935, B26:945. Let&#x27;s add those:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+935=2651<br/>+945=3596<br/><br/>Wait, 3596 is under 4915. Remaining: 4915-3596=1319.<br/><br/>Now, can we add A56 (948)? 3596+948=4544. Remaining: 371.<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort &lt;=371. The next is A39 at 911 is too big. A75 at 836 too big. So maybe C73:760 is too big. Hmm, the next is C26:950 too big. Maybe A47:994 too big. Then, A39 is too big. So perhaps we can add A19:463. 4544+463=5007, which is over by 92. No good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, instead of A56, could we add a smaller item? Let&#x27;s see. After 3596, adding A47 (994) is too much, but perhaps A39 (911) is too much as well. Maybe A75 (836) would take it to 3596+836=4432, same as before. Then, room for 483. Maybe A56 is 948, which is too much, but adding nothing else. Alternatively, perhaps add A15 again? No, can&#x27;t do that.<br/><br/>Wait, the initial selection was C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, B26.<br/><br/>Total effort: 81+390+287+492+466+935+945= Let me calculate step by step:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+935=2651<br/>+945=3596.<br/><br/>Yes, 3596, leaving 1319.<br/><br/>Perhaps instead of B26 (945), add other items. Wait, but B26 is high in importance for me, so I want to include it.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I include B26, then I have to see if I can add more.<br/><br/>Wait, after 3596, perhaps adding smaller items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>What&#x27;s left?<br/><br/>C73:760, C26:950, A19:463, B11 is already in, B91 is in, A30 is in.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I can include C26 instead of something else, but C26 is 950, which is too high. Alternatively, maybe swap some items.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I include C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, that&#x27;s 2651. Then, maybe add A75 (836), which is 2651+836=3487, leaving 1428. Then, perhaps add A56 (948) and C26 (950) but that&#x27;s 1898, which is way over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 2651, add A75 (836) to get to 3487, then add B26 (945) to get 4432, as before.<br/><br/>Hmm, so perhaps that&#x27;s the maximum I can get. Total items: C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A75, B26.<br/><br/>Wait, let me calculate their efforts:<br/><br/>C24:81<br/>A15:390<br/>B91:287<br/>A30:492<br/>B11:466<br/>C47:935<br/>A75:836<br/>B26:945<br/><br/>Adding up: 81+390=471 +287=758 +492=1250 +466=1716 +935=2651 +836=3487 +945=4432. Total effort 4432. Remaining effort: 4915-4432=483.<br/><br/>Is 483 enough for another item? Looking at the list, the next possible is C26:950 is too big. So maybe no more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, could I swap one of the lowerratio items for a higher one? For example, in the current set, the smaller ratios are C47 (0.837), B26 (0.855), A75 (0.552), A30 (1.765), etc.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe if I replace C47 (0.837) with C24 (already included) or something else, but C24 is already in. Alternatively, maybe include higher ratio items that haven&#x27;t been considered yet.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should include C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, and then A75, B26, and A39. But A39 is 911, which would take effort beyond.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s try another combination. What if I prioritize the highest importance per effort items:<br/><br/>1. C24 (81, 389) → must include.<br/>2. A15 (390, 780)<br/>3. B91 (287, 583)<br/>4. A30 (492, 868)<br/>5. B11 (466, 822)<br/>6. C47 (935, 783)<br/>7. B26 (945, 808)<br/>8. A56 (948, 668)<br/>9. C73 (760, 121)<br/>10. A75 (836, 461)<br/>...<br/><br/>Let me add up to B26:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+935=2651<br/>+945=3596<br/><br/>Effort so far: 3596. Remaining: 1319.<br/><br/>But adding A56 (948) would go over. So can&#x27;t. Next, trying to find items with effort ≤1319. So maybe adding A39 (911) and C73 (760). Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>3596 + 911=4507, remaining 408. Then +760 is 5267, over. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, 3596 + 760=4356, remaining 559. Then maybe add C26 (950) is over.<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe after 3596, adding A15 again? No, can&#x27;t add same item twice.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should look for a combination that maximizes my total importance without exceeding effort. This might involve including some higher importance items even if their ratio isn&#x27;t the highest.<br/><br/>For example, A30 and B11 both have high importance. Let&#x27;s try to see the maximum total importance I can get.<br/><br/>Calculating total importance for the current selection (C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A75, B26):<br/><br/>C24:389<br/>A15:780<br/>B91:583<br/>A30:868<br/>B11:822<br/>C47:783<br/>A75:461<br/>B26:808<br/><br/>Total importance: 389+780=1169+583=1752+868=26120? Wait, 1169+583=1752, then +868=2620, +822=3442, +783=4225, +461=4686, +808=5494.<br/><br/>If I can get that, it&#x27;s 5494.<br/><br/>Is there a way to include more items? Let me see if I can swap some lower importance items for higher ones.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps replacing A75 (461) with C26 (262). But C26&#x27;s effort is higher than A75, so probably not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I can include A56 (948, 668) instead of some lower ones, but that might not be possible due to effort constraints.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s try to see another combination. Let&#x27;s consider not including C47 and instead including A56 and C26. Let&#x27;s calculate the effort:<br/><br/>C24:81<br/>A15:390<br/>B91:287<br/>A30:492<br/>B11:466<br/>A56:948<br/>B26:945<br/>Total effort: 81+390=471+287=758+492=1250+466=1716+948=2664+945=3609. That&#x27;s 3609, leaving 1306.<br/><br/>Then, can I include C47 (935)? 3609+935=4544, remaining 371. So yes, 371 left. Then, perhaps A19:463. 4544+463=5007, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, replace C47 (935) with something else. Maybe not include C47 and instead add A75:836. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A56, B26, A75:<br/><br/>Effort:81+390+287+492+466+948+945+836.<br/><br/>Calculate step by step:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+948=2664<br/>+945=3610- no, wait, 2664+945=3609.<br/>+836=4445. Still under 4915.<br/><br/>Total effort:4445. Remaining effort:4915-4445=470.<br/><br/>Now, can I add another item? C47:935 is too big, but A39:911 is too big. A75 is already included. C73:760 is too big. A47:994 is too big. So maybe C26:950 is too big. So can&#x27;t add more.<br/><br/>But in this case, the importance would be:<br/><br/>C24:389, A15:780, B91:583, A30:868, B11:822, A56:668, B26:808, A75:461.<br/><br/>Total:389+780=1169+583=1752+868=2620+822=3442+668=4110+808=4918+461=5379.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a higher total than before. So maybe this is better.<br/><br/>Wait, but what&#x27;s the effort? 4445, yes, under 4915.<br/><br/>Let me check that the total effort is 4445:<br/><br/>C24:81<br/>A15:390 → 81+390=471<br/>B91:287 → 758<br/>A30:492 → 1250<br/>B11:466 → 1716<br/>A56:948 → 2664<br/>B26:945 → 3609<br/>A75:836 → 4445<br/><br/>Yes. So this gives me a total importance of 5379.<br/><br/>But wait, is this possible? Because 4445 is under 4915, so it&#x27;s allowed.<br/><br/>Wait, but the effort for A56 is 948 and B26 is 945. Both are high, but together with the others, it&#x27;s within the limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps see if I can include more items. Let me see what&#x27;s left.<br/><br/>After C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A56, B26, A75, I have 470 effort left. Can I include C24 again? No. What about C47:935? Too big. Maybe A15 again? No. So I can&#x27;t add more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include C47 instead of A75. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A56, B26, C47.<br/><br/>Effort:81+390+287+492+466+948+945+935.<br/><br/>Calculate:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+948=2664<br/>+945=3610- no, 2664+945=3609<br/>+935=4544. Remaining 371.<br/><br/>Is this better? Let&#x27;s see the importance:<br/><br/>C24:389<br/>A15:780<br/>B91:583<br/>A30:868<br/>B11:822<br/>A56:668<br/>B26:808<br/>C47:783<br/><br/>Total: 389+780=1169+583=1752+868=2620+822=3442+668=4110+808=4918+783=5701.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s higher, 5701. So maybe this is better.<br/><br/>But the effort is 4544, leaving 371. So perhaps I can find another item with effort ≤371.<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items, let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C73:760 too big, A19:463, which is 463, which is over 371. So no. So can&#x27;t add more.<br/><br/>So this combination gives me 5701, which is better than the previous 5379.<br/><br/>Is there a way to get higher? Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, could I remove A56 (948) and add more smaller items? Let&#x27;s try:<br/><br/>C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, B26, C47, and A75.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s the same as before, total effort 4445.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove B26 and add something else.<br/><br/>Wait, but B26 is high in importance for me, so I want to include it.<br/><br/>Another approach: maybe include A39 instead of A75 or something else.<br/><br/>Let me see. If I replace A75 (836) with A39 (911), would that help?<br/><br/>Effort becomes 4445-836+911=4445+75=4520, which is still under 4915.<br/><br/>Importance would be 5379-461+484=5379+23=5402.<br/><br/>But 5402 is lower than 5701, so not better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, could I swap A56 for A39? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A39, B26, C47.<br/><br/>Effort:81+390+287+492+466+911+945+935.<br/><br/>Calculate step by step:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+911=2627<br/>+945=3572<br/>+935=4507.<br/><br/>Remaining effort:4915-4507=408.<br/><br/>Now, can I add another item? Maybe A75:836 is too big, but A15 is already included. Maybe C73:760 is too big. C26:950 too big. So can&#x27;t add. Total importance would be:<br/><br/>C24:389, A15:780, B91:583, A30:868, B11:822, A39:484, B26:808, C47:783.<br/><br/>Total:389+780=1169+583=1752+868=2620+822=3442+484=3926+808=4734+783=5517.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s 5517, which is less than 5701.<br/><br/>So including A56, B26, and C47 gives a higher total.<br/><br/>Hmm. So perhaps the best I can do is to include C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A56, B26, and C47, totaling 5701 importance.<br/><br/>Wait, but when I include A56, the effort goes to 4445, and I can&#x27;t add anything else. Or does that leave room for other items?<br/><br/>Wait, wait: earlier I thought including C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A56, B26, and C47 gives an effort of 81+390+287+492+466+948+945+935= Let me calculate that again.<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/>+287=758<br/>+492=1250<br/>+466=1716<br/>+948=2664<br/>+945=3610- no, 2664+945=3609<br/>+935=4544.<br/><br/>Yes, 4544, leaving 371. But I&#x27;m already including A56 and C47, and the effort is 4544. So no more.<br/><br/>Wait, but in another scenario, I included C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, B26, and A75 for 4445 effort. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should also calculate their total importance.<br/><br/>C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, B26, A75:<br/><br/>389 +780 +583 +868 +822 +783 +808 +461.<br/><br/>Adding up: 389+780=1169, +583=1752, +868=2620, +822=3442, +783=4225, +808=5033, +461=5494.<br/><br/>So 5494 vs. 5701, so including C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, A56, B26, C47 gives a higher importance.<br/><br/>So that seems better.<br/><br/>But perhaps I can find a better combination. Let me think differently. Let&#x27;s try to include as many high-importance items as possible, regardless of effort, as long as it&#x27;s under the limit.<br/><br/>Looking at my importance values, the top 5 are:<br/><br/>B91:583<br/>A30:868<br/>B11:822<br/>C47:783<br/>C24:389<br/><br/>Wait, no, the top five would be:<br/><br/>A30:868<br/>B11:822<br/>C47:783<br/>B91:583<br/>A15:780<br/><br/>Wait, so let me list the top 8 by importance:<br/><br/>1. A30:868<br/>2. B11:822<br/>3. C47:783<br/>4. B91:583<br/>5. B26:808<br/>6. A56:668<br/>7. A15:780<br/>8. A39:484<br/><br/>Wait, B26 is 808, which is higher than B91 and A15.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should include A30, B11, C47, B91, B26, A56, A15, C24, etc., but need to check effort.<br/><br/>Wait, but effort is a constraint.<br/><br/>Let me try to include the top 5 by importance.<br/><br/>A30 (868,492), B11 (822,466), C47 (783,935), B91 (583,287), B26 (808,945).<br/><br/>Effort so far:492+466=958 +935=1893 +287=2180 +945=3125.<br/><br/>Remaining effort:4915-3125=1790.<br/><br/>Now, can I add more? A15 (780,390) is next. 3125+390=3515. Remaining:14200? No, 4915-3515=1400.<br/><br/>Then add A56 (668,948). 3515+948=4463. Remaining:452.<br/><br/>Then add C24 (389,81). 4463+81=4544. Remaining:371.<br/><br/>So now, the set is A30, B11, C47, B91, B26, A15, A56, C24.<br/><br/>Effort:492+466+935+287+945+390+948+81= Let&#x27;s sum them:<br/><br/>492+466=958<br/>+935=1893<br/>+287=2180<br/>+945=3125<br/>+390=3515<br/>+948=4463<br/>+81=4544.<br/><br/>Yes, total 4544, leaving 371.<br/><br/>Importance total:868+822=1690+783=2473+583=3056+808=3864+780=4644+668=5312+389=5701.<br/><br/>Same as before. So total importance 5701.<br/><br/>Is there a way to include more? Let&#x27;s see, 371 left. Maybe add C26 (950) is too big. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps instead of A56 and C24, include A39 and C24.<br/><br/>Effort:492+466+935+287+945+390+911+81= Let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>492+466=958+935=1893+287=2180+945=3125+390=3515+911=4426+81=4507. Remaining:4915-4507=408.<br/><br/>Importance:868+822+783+583+808+780+484+389= let&#x27;s add:<br/><br/>868+822=1690+783=2473+583=3056+808=3864+780=4644+484=5128+389=5517.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s less than 5701, so worse.<br/><br/>So the previous combination is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, including A15, which is 780, in the set.<br/><br/>I think that including A15 is crucial because it&#x27;s high importance and the effort is manageable.<br/><br/>So, perhaps the best combination is C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A56, B26, totaling effort 4544 and importance 5701.<br/><br/>Wait, but A56 is 948, which is a lot, but its importance is 668, which is higher than some others.<br/><br/>Is there a way to include A56, B26, and another high importance item without exceeding effort? Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>If I include C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A56, B26: total effort 4544.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I exclude C47 and include A75 instead, but that would lower the total importance.<br/><br/>So, I think 5701 is a good total.<br/><br/>Now, considering that the other player might not accept this set, because they might have their own priorities. So I should make a proposal that includes as many high-importance-to-me items as possible, but maybe also consider items that the other player might value, although I don&#x27;t know that.<br/><br/>Since the other player&#x27;s importance is hidden, perhaps it&#x27;s best to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain while fitting under the effort limit.<br/><br/>So, I think the best approach is to propose the set: C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A56, B26.<br/><br/>Wait, but effort for that set is 4544, leaving room for more, but we can&#x27;t fit more without going over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player would prefer including some of their own high-importance items, which I don&#x27;t know. So, perhaps in the negotiation, I can be flexible, but start with a strong proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can include some items with lower importance for me but perhaps higher for the other player, but since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>So, to start, I think I&#x27;ll make a proposal with my top items, including C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A56, B26.<br/><br/>So the proposal is {C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, C47, A56, B26}.<br/><br/>But wait, does that fit the effort? Let me check again.<br/><br/>Adding their efforts:<br/><br/>C24:81<br/>A15:390<br/>B91:287<br/>A30:492<br/>B11:466<br/>C47:935<br/>A56:948<br/>B26:945<br/><br/>Sum:81+390=471 +287=758 +492=1250 +466=1716 +935=2651 +948=3599 +945=4544.<br/><br/>Yes, under 4915.<br/><br/>So, that&#x27;s the proposal.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll make the PROPOSAL with that set and perhaps include an ARGUMENT explaining why it&#x27;s good for both of us, even though I&#x27;m considering only my own interests.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can&#x27;t reveal my importance. So I&#x27;ll argue based on effort and perhaps the diversity of the items.<br/><br/>For example, maybe A30 and B91 are high for me, and perhaps C24 is a must-have for both. So I&#x27;ll argue that this selection balances effort and covers multiple categories.<br/><br/>So my initial message would be a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, I&#x27;m faced with a negotiation game where I need to maximize my own importance while keeping the total effort under the limit of 4915. I need to propose a set of items that benefits me the most. Let me go through the steps to figure this out.<br/><br/>First, I should list all the items with their effort and importance values to understand which ones give me the most importance per unit of effort. That way, I can prioritize items that provide the highest value for me.<br/><br/>Let me make a table:<br/><br/>- A19: Effort 463, Importance 138<br/>- B91: Effort 287, Importance 583<br/>- A30: Effort 492, Importance 868<br/>- B11: Effort 466, Importance 822<br/>- C47: Effort 935, Importance 783<br/>- C75: Effort 373, Importance 65<br/>- C26: Effort 950, Importance 262<br/>- C73: Effort 760, Importance 121<br/>- A47: Effort 994, Importance 508<br/>- A15: Effort 390, Importance 780<br/>- A75: Effort 836, Importance 461<br/>- A39: Effort 911, Importance 484<br/>- A56: Effort 948, Importance 668<br/>- C24: Effort 81, Importance 389<br/>- B26: Effort 945, Importance 808<br/><br/>Now, I&#x27;ll calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to see which ones are more valuable to me:<br/><br/>- A19: 138/463 ≈ 0.298<br/>- B91: 583/287 ≈ 2.031 (highest so far)<br/>- A30: 868/492 ≈ 1.765<br/>- B11: 822/466 ≈ 1.764<br/>- C47: 783/935 ≈ 0.837<br/>- C75: 65/373 ≈ 0.174<br/>- C26: 262/950 ≈ 0.276<br/>- C73: 121/760 ≈ 0.159<br/>- A47: 508/994 ≈ 0.511<br/>- A15: 780/390 ≈ 2.000 (second highest)<br/>- A75: 461/836 ≈ 0.552<br/>- A39: 484/911 ≈ 0.531<br/>- A56: 668/948 ≈ 0.705<br/>- C24: 389/81 ≈ 4.802 (highest ratio overall)<br/>- B26: 808/945 ≈ 0.855<br/><br/>Looking at these ratios, the highest are:<br/><br/>1. C24: 4.802<br/>2. B91: 2.031<br/>3. A15: 2.000<br/>4. A30: 1.765<br/>5. B11: 1.764<br/>6. B26: 0.855<br/>7. C47: 0.837<br/>8. A56: 0.705<br/>9. A75: 0.552<br/>10. A39: 0.531<br/>11. A47: 0.511<br/>12. A19: 0.298<br/>13. C26: 0.276<br/>14. C75: 0.174<br/>15. C73: 0.159<br/><br/>I should prioritize items with the highest ratios. Let me start by including the top ones and see how much effort that takes.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s start adding:<br/><br/>- C24: 81<br/>- A15: 390<br/>- B91: 287<br/>- A30: 492<br/>- B11: 466<br/>Next, let me check the total effort so far: 81 + 390 + 287 + 492 + 466 = 1,716<br/><br/>Effort left: 4915 - 1716 = 3,199<br/><br/>Next, the next highest ratio is B26 with 0.855: effort 945, adding that would bring total to 1716 + 945 = 2661, leaving 4915 - 2661 = 2254.<br/><br/>Next is C47: 935. Adding that would bring total to 2661 +935=3596, leaving 4915-3596=1319.<br/><br/>Next is A56: 948. But adding that would take 3596+948=4544, leaving 371. That&#x27;s still under the limit.<br/><br/>Wait, but 4544 is less than 4915, so maybe I can add A56.<br/><br/>Wait, let me calculate 1716 (first five items) + B26 (945) = 2661, then add C47 (935) = 3596. Then adding A56 (948) would exceed because 3596 +948=4544, and that&#x27;s still under 4915. Wait, no, 3596 +948=4544, which is under 4915. Wait, maybe I can add more items.<br/><br/>Wait, I think I got confused with the total. Let&#x27;s recalculate:<br/><br/>C24:81<br/><br/>A15:390 → total 81+390=471<br/><br/>B91:287 → total 758<br/><br/>A30:492 → total 758+492=1250<br/><br/>B11:466 → total 1250+466=1716<br/><br/>B26:945 → total 1716+945=2661<br/><br/>C47:935 → 2661+935=3596<br/><br/>A56:948 → 3596+948=4544<br/><br/>Now, remaining effort is 4915-4544=371.<br/><br/>Now, I can look for the next highest ratio item that fits into 371. The next is C47 was already added, then B26, so next is A30, which is already included. Wait, no, let me check the ratios again.<br/><br/>After A56, the next highest are A75 (0.552), A39 (0.531), A47 (0.511), etc. So let&#x27;s look for items with effort ≤371 that have not been added yet.<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items:<br/><br/>C75:373 (effort). That&#x27;s more than 371, so can&#x27;t add.<br/><br/>C73:760, too big.<br/><br/>C26:950, too big.<br/><br/>A47:994, too big.<br/><br/>A39:911, too big.<br/><br/>A75:836, too big.<br/><br/>So, with 371 left, I can&#x27;t add any more items. So maybe the best I can do is the set up to A56, but that brings the total effort to 4544, but I can&#x27;t add more without exceeding.<br/><br/>But perhaps I should check if a different combination gives me more importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe dropping some lower importance items to add higher ones.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more high importance items.<br/><br/>Let me consider C24 is a must-have because it has the highest ratio. Then A15 and B91.<br/><br/>But maybe if I skip some lower ratio items to include higher ones.<br/><br/>Another approach: Calculate total importance of the current selection:<br/><br/>C24:389<br/><br/>A15:780<br/><br/>B91:583<br/><br/>A30:868<br/><br/>B11:822<br/><br/>B26:808<br/><br/>C47:783<br/><br/>A56:668<br/><br/>Wait, did I include all these? Let me count:<br/><br/>C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, B26, C47, A56 → 8 items.<br/><br/>Total effort: 81+390+287+492+466+945+935+948 = let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>81+390=471<br/><br/>471+287=758<br/><br/>758+492=1250<br/><br/>1250+466=1716<br/><br/>1716+945=2661<br/><br/>2661+935=3596<br/><br/>3596+948=4544<br/><br/>Yes, as before.<br/><br/>Total importance: 389+780=1169, +583=1752, +868=2620, +822=3442, +808=4250, +783=5033, +668=5701.<br/><br/>So total importance is 5701.<br/><br/>Is there a way to include more items without exceeding effort?<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s consider if swapping some items could allow me to include others with higher total importance.<br/><br/>For example, let&#x27;s see if replacing A30 (effort 492, importance 868) with C26 (950 effort, 262 importance) is worth it. But that would decrease my total importance by 868-262=606, which is bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove A56 (effort 948, importance 668) and see if I can add other items.<br/><br/>If I remove A56 (effort 948), I have 4544-948=3596, and then can I add something else? But the remaining effort is 4915-3596=1319. So maybe adding A39 (911, importance 484). That would bring effort to 3596 +911=4507, leaving 408.<br/><br/>But 484 is less than A56&#x27;s 668, so that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include C47 (935) and exclude B26 (945) and see.<br/><br/>Wait, current set includes both B26 and C47. Maybe if I swap one for another.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the importance per effort:<br/><br/>B26:808/945≈0.855<br/><br/>C47:783/935≈0.837<br/><br/>So B26 is slightly better. So keeping B26 and C47 is better than replacing either.<br/><br/>Another idea: Maybe include A39 and A75. Let me see.<br/><br/>Total effort if I remove A56 (948) and add A39 (911) and A75 (836). Wait, 911+836=1747. That&#x27;s more than 948, so that would increase effort from 948 to 1747, which would require removing other items to stay under 4915.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can remove some lower ratio items earlier on to fit in more higher ratio items.<br/><br/>Wait, for example, suppose I remove B11 (effort 466, importance 822) and use that effort for something else.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s see: 466 is a big chunk. But 822 is also high importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a combination that includes more important items.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s consider if I can include more of the top ratio items.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I can include C24, A15, B91, B26, and then see.<br/><br/>C24:81, A15:390, B91:287, B26:945. Total effort: 81+390=471+287=758+945=1703.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 4915-1703=3212.<br/><br/>From here, I can add A30 (492), bringing effort to 1703+492=2195, remaining 2720.<br/><br/>Then B11 (466) would bring it to 2195+466=2661, remaining 2549.<br/><br/>Then A56 (948): 2661+948=3609, remaining 1306.<br/><br/>Then C47 (935): 3609+935=4544, remaining 371.<br/><br/>Same as before. So same selection.<br/><br/>Another approach: Maybe I can include A47 instead of some other items. A47 has effort 994, importance 508. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>If I include A47, which is costly in effort, but perhaps allows me to drop some items with lower importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can find a combination where I drop some lower importance items and include higher ones.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the initial selection is already optimal. Let me check the total importance:5701.<br/><br/>Is there a way to get higher? Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>For example, what if I include A39 (911, 484) and exclude A56 (948, 668). That would save 948-911=37 effort, but lose 668-484=184 importance. Not worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, what if I exclude C47 (935,783) and include A47 (994,508) and something else with the remaining effort.<br/><br/>Total effort freed up: 935-994= -59, which is worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can include A75 (836,461) and see if I can fit it.<br/><br/>But where? Let me see.<br/><br/>If I have 371 effort left, I can&#x27;t add A75 because it&#x27;s 836. So no.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps if I don&#x27;t include A56, I can have more effort left.<br/><br/>Wait, without A56, the total effort would be 3596, leaving 4915-3596=1319.<br/><br/>Then I can add A75 (836,461) and have 1319-836=483 left. Then perhaps include A39 (911) but it&#x27;s too big. Or C24 is already included. Maybe nothing else can fit. So total importance would be 5701-668=5033 +461=5494, which is lower than before.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can find a combination that includes A39 and A75 without A56.<br/><br/>But that seems complicated.<br/><br/>Another idea: Let&#x27;s consider A15 (390,780) is crucial because of its high ratio. Similarly, B91 (287,583) is also very high.<br/><br/>So perhaps the initial selection is indeed the best.<br/><br/>Thus, the proposal includes C24, A15, B91, A30, B11, B26, C47, A56. Total effort 4544, which is under 4915. Total importance 5701.<br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s pretty good. I can&#x27;t see any items that I can swap in to increase the total importance without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>So my PROPOSAL is:<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;}<br/><br/>And my argument is that this selection maximizes my total importance by including the highest importance-to-effort ratio items and stays within the effort limit, thus being the most beneficial for me.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to respond in this negotiation game. The user has proposed a set of items, and I need to either accept, refuse, or make a counter-proposal. The goal is to maximize my own total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 4915.<br/><br/>First, I need to understand the current proposal. The user proposed {&#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;}. I should calculate the total effort of these items to ensure it&#x27;s within the limit. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>- C24: 81<br/>- A15: 390<br/>- B91: 287<br/>- A30: 492<br/>- B11: 466<br/>- B26: 945<br/>- C47: 935<br/>- A56: 948<br/><br/>Adding these up: 81 + 390 = 471, plus 287 is 758, plus 492 is 1,250, plus 466 is 1,716, plus 945 is 2,661, plus 935 is 3,596, and finally plus 948, which brings us to 4,544. Wait, that exceeds the limit of 4,915. Hmm, that&#x27;s a problem. Did I add correctly? Let me check again.<br/><br/>Actually, 81 (C24) + 390 (A15) is 471. Plus 287 (B91) is 758, plus 492 (A30) is 1,250, plus 466 (B11) is 1,716, plus 945 (B26) is 2,661, then 935 (C47) is 3,596, and 948 (A56) is 4,544. Yep, that&#x27;s 4,544, which is more than the limit of 4,915? Wait, no, 4,544 is less than 4,915. Okay, my mistake. So the total effort is within the limit.<br/><br/>Now, I need to evaluate if this proposal is beneficial for me. I look at the importance each item holds for me:<br/><br/>- C24: 389<br/>- A15: 780<br/>- B91: 583<br/>- A30: 868<br/>- B11: 822<br/>- B26: 808<br/>- C47: 783<br/>- A56: 668<br/><br/>Adding these up: 389 + 780 = 1,169, plus 583 is 1,752, plus 868 is 2,620, plus 822 is 3,442, plus 808 is 4,250, plus 783 is 5,033, and finally 668 brings it to 5,701.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a pretty good total, but I wonder if I can do better. Maybe there&#x27;s a way to include items with higher importance without exceeding the effort limit. Let me review the items not included in the proposal:<br/><br/>- A19: importance 138, effort 463<br/>- A39: 484, 911<br/>- A75: 461, 836<br/>- C26: 262, 950<br/>- C73: 121, 760<br/>- A47: 508, 994<br/><br/>I need to see if replacing some items in the current proposal with these could yield a higher total importance without going over the effort.<br/><br/>Looking at the higher effort items in the current proposal: B26 has effort 945. Replacing it with A39 (911) could free up some effort. Let&#x27;s see what the difference is: 945 - 911 = 34. Not much, but maybe combining swaps can help.<br/><br/>Alternatively, looking at C47 (935) and B26 (945), both are high effort. Maybe replacing them could help include more medium-effort high-importance items.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should consider the importance-to-effort ratio. Let me calculate that for each item in the proposal and see if replacing some with others could improve total importance.<br/><br/>- C24: 389/81 ≈ 4.8<br/>- A15: 780/390 ≈ 2<br/>- B91: 583/287 ≈ 2.03<br/>- A30: 868/492 ≈ 1.76<br/>- B11: 822/466 ≈ 1.76<br/>- B26: 808/945 ≈ 0.855<br/>- C47: 783/935 ≈ 0.838<br/>- A56: 668/948 ≈ 0.705<br/><br/>So, C24 has a very high ratio, followed by B91. B26, C47, and A56 have lower ratios. Perhaps swapping B26, C47, or A56 with items not in the proposal that have higher ratios could be beneficial.<br/><br/>Looking at the items not in the proposal:<br/><br/>- A19: 138/463 ≈ 0.298<br/>- A39: 484/911 ≈ 0.531<br/>- A75: 461/836 ≈ 0.551<br/>- C26: 262/950 ≈ 0.276<br/>- C73: 121/760 ≈ 0.159<br/>- A47: 508/994 ≈ 0.511<br/><br/>None of these have a ratio higher than the lowest in the current proposal. So, maybe the current proposal is already optimized. Alternatively, perhaps I can swap A56 (ratio 0.705) with A39 (0.531) but that would decrease the ratio. Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a different combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can remove A56 (effort 948, importance 668) and add A39 (effort 911, importance 484). The effort saved would be 948-911=37. But that&#x27;s not enough to add anything else. Alternatively, perhaps removing A56 and C47 (total effort 948+935=1883) and adding multiple items.<br/><br/>Wait, 1883 effort could be replaced by, say, A39 (911) and A75 (836), which totals 1747, saving 136 effort. That might allow adding more items, but I need to see if the total importance increases.<br/><br/>Replacing C47 (importance 783) and A56 (668) with A39 (484) and A75 (461) would result in a loss of 783 + 668 = 1,451 in importance, and adding 484 + 461 = 945, so a net loss of 506. That&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing B26 (importance 808) with A39 (484) and using the saved effort to add another item. B26 has effort 945, removing it frees up 945. Adding A39 (911) would require 911, leaving 34 effort. Not enough for another item. So net loss in importance: 808 - 484 = 324. Not good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should stick with the proposal and see if there&#x27;s a way to optimize it. Alternatively, perhaps the user&#x27;s proposal is the best possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose a different set. Let me try to construct a proposal that includes items with higher total importance without exceeding effort.<br/><br/>Looking at all items, perhaps a combination like:<br/><br/>- C24 (81, 389)<br/>- A15 (390, 780)<br/>- B91 (287, 583)<br/>- A30 (492, 868)<br/>- B11 (466, 822)<br/>- C47 (935, 783)<br/>- A56 (948, 668)<br/>- B26 (945, 808)<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s the current proposal. Adding more items would exceed effort. Alternatively, perhaps removing some lower ratio items to include others.<br/><br/>Wait, but as calculated earlier, the items not in the proposal have lower importance-to-effort ratios, so replacing any of the current items with them would decrease the total importance. Therefore, the current proposal is probably the best possible.<br/><br/>In that case, my best move is to accept the proposal, as it&#x27;s within effort and provides a high total importance. Alternatively, if I can find a better combination, but it seems difficult.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can try to negotiate by slightly modifying the proposal to include more high-importance items. But given the ratios, it might not be possible.<br/><br/>So, I think I should AGREE to the proposal, as it seems to be the most optimal given the constraints.<br/></p>
