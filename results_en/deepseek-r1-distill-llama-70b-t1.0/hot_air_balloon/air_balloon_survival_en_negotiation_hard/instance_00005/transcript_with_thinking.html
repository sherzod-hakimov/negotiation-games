        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 3386<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;C17&quot;: 313, &quot;B41&quot;: 720, &quot;A71&quot;: 175, &quot;C00&quot;: 461, &quot;B35&quot;: 635, &quot;A77&quot;: 685, &quot;A03&quot;: 544, &quot;A04&quot;: 203, &quot;C54&quot;: 369, &quot;C01&quot;: 539, &quot;A87&quot;: 4, &quot;B32&quot;: 695, &quot;B86&quot;: 399, &quot;B33&quot;: 594, &quot;A10&quot;: 437}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;C17&quot;: 138, &quot;B41&quot;: 583, &quot;A71&quot;: 65, &quot;C00&quot;: 262, &quot;B35&quot;: 121, &quot;A77&quot;: 508, &quot;A03&quot;: 461, &quot;A04&quot;: 484, &quot;C54&quot;: 668, &quot;C01&quot;: 389, &quot;A87&quot;: 215, &quot;B32&quot;: 97, &quot;B86&quot;: 500, &quot;B33&quot;: 30, &quot;A10&quot;: 400}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!<br/><br/>Interaction Protocol:<br/><br/>You may only use the following structured formats in a message:<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Propose keeping exactly those items.<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Explicitly reject opponent&#x27;s proposal.<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;...&#x27;}<br/>Defend your last proposal or argue against the player&#x27;s proposal.<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Accept the opponent&#x27;s proposal which ends the game.<br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;...&#x27;}<br/>	Describe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>You may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>You may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>Total effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.<br/>Do NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.<br/>A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Alright, I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I have to collaborate with another participant to select a set of items. The goal is to maximize my own importance while keeping the total effort under 3386. Let me break down what I know and how I should approach this.<br/><br/>First, I&#x27;ll list out all the items, their efforts, and my personal importance for each. It might help to see everything in a table for clarity.<br/><br/>The items are:<br/>- C17: Effort 313, Importance 138<br/>- B41: Effort 720, Importance 583<br/>- A71: Effort 175, Importance 65<br/>- C00: Effort 461, Importance 262<br/>- B35: Effort 635, Importance 121<br/>- A77: Effort 685, Importance 508<br/>- A03: Effort 544, Importance 461<br/>- A04: Effort 203, Importance 484<br/>- C54: Effort 369, Importance 668<br/>- C01: Effort 539, Importance 389<br/>- A87: Effort 4, Importance 215<br/>- B32: Effort 695, Importance 97<br/>- B86: Effort 399, Importance 500<br/>- B33: Effort 594, Importance 30<br/>- A10: Effort 437, Importance 400<br/><br/>I notice that A87 has the lowest effort (4) and it&#x27;s quite important to me, so keeping this seems like a no-brainer. Similarly, items with lower effort and high importance are good candidates. I should prioritize high importance per unit effort.<br/><br/>Next, I&#x27;ll calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to see which ones give me the most value. This might help prioritize which items to include first.<br/><br/>Calculating the ratios:<br/>- C17: 138/313 ≈ 0.44<br/>- B41: 583/720 ≈ 0.809<br/>- A71: 65/175 ≈ 0.371<br/>- C00: 262/461 ≈ 0.568<br/>- B35: 121/635 ≈ 0.190<br/>- A77: 508/685 ≈ 0.741<br/>- A03: 461/544 ≈ 0.847<br/>- A04: 484/203 ≈ 2.384<br/>- C54: 668/369 ≈ 1.808<br/>- C01: 389/539 ≈ 0.722<br/>- A87: 215/4 = 53.75<br/>- B32: 97/695 ≈ 0.140<br/>- B86: 500/399 ≈ 1.253<br/>- B33: 30/594 ≈ 0.0505<br/>- A10: 400/437 ≈ 0.915<br/><br/>Looking at these ratios, A87 has the highest by far, so it&#x27;s a must-include. Then A04, C54, A03, and B41 follow with high ratios. Maybe I should aim to include as many of these as possible within the effort limit.<br/><br/>Starting with A87 (effort 4), that leaves me with 3386-4=3382. Now, next is A04 with effort 203. Adding that, total effort used is 4+203=207, leaving 3386-207=3179.<br/><br/>Next, C54 has effort 369, which brings total to 207+369=576, leaving 3179-369=2810. Then, A03 with 544: 576+544=1120, leaving 3386-1120=2266.<br/><br/>Adding B41&#x27;s 720 would bring it to 1120+720=1840, leaving 3386-1840=1546. Now, looking for the next highest ratios. A77 has a ratio of 0.741 and effort 685. Adding that would bring us to 1840+685=2525, leaving 3386-2525=861.<br/><br/>Next, C01 has a ratio of 0.722 and effort 539. Adding that would take total effort to 2525+539=3064, leaving 3386-3064=322. The remaining items with effort under 322 could be C17 (313), which has a decent ratio of 0.44. Adding that would total 3064+313=3377, leaving 3386-3377=9, which isn&#x27;t enough for any other items except maybe A71, but that&#x27;s 175, which is too big.<br/><br/>So the set so far includes A87, A04, C54, A03, B41, A77, C01, and C17. Let&#x27;s calculate the total effort: 4+203+369+544+720+685+539+313= let me sum that:<br/><br/>4+203=207<br/><br/>207+369=576<br/><br/>576+544=1120<br/><br/>1120+720=1840<br/><br/>1840+685=2525<br/><br/>2525+539=3064<br/><br/>3064+313=3377. That&#x27;s within the limit, and the total effort is 3377, leaving 9 unused.<br/><br/>The total importance from these items would be 215+484+668+461+583+508+389+138. Let&#x27;s sum that:<br/><br/>215+484=699<br/><br/>699+668=1367<br/><br/>1367+461=1828<br/><br/>1828+583=2411<br/><br/>2411+508=2919<br/><br/>2919+389=3308<br/><br/>3308+138=3446.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s pretty good, but maybe I can include more items for higher importance. Let&#x27;s see if there are other combinations that use the remaining 9 effort elsewhere. But since no item has effort less than 175 except A87 (which is already included), maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe swapping some items for higher importance. For example, A03 (544 effort, 461 importance) could be replaced with something else. Let&#x27;s see what other items have lower effort but decent importance. For instance, C00 has effort 461 and importance 262, which is lower than A03. So keeping A03 is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps we can include A10 (effort 437) which has higher importance (400) than some others. If we remove C17 (effort 313, importance 138) and see if A10 can be added. Let&#x27;s recalculate:<br/><br/>Total effort without C17 is 3377-313=3064. Adding A10 (437) would make it 3064+437=3501, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>What about removing B41 (720) and adding A10? 3377-720=2657. 2657+437=3094. Now, can we add other items? Maybe B86 (399) would fit since 3094+399=3493, which is over. No good.<br/><br/>Perhaps there&#x27;s a better combination that allows for higher total importance without exceeding the effort limit. Let me consider including B86, which has high importance and moderate effort. Let me see if replacing some items can make room for B86.<br/><br/>If I remove C17 (313) and C00 isn&#x27;t in the current set, so maybe add B86 (399). Wait, I don&#x27;t have C00 in the set; the current set is A87, A04, C54, A03, B41, A77, C01, C17. If I remove C17 (313) and add B86 (399), that&#x27;s a net increase in effort by 86. So total effort would go from 3377 to 3377 -313 +399= 3463, which is over. So that&#x27;s not feasible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe swap C01 (539) for B86 (399) and see. C01 has importance 389, B86 has 500. So removing C01 saves 539, adding B86 costs 399, net saving 140, which allows adding another item. But I&#x27;m constrained by the limit.<br/><br/>Let me try to adjust the set.<br/><br/>Another approach is to maximize the total importance, perhaps by including B86. Let me try a different combination.<br/><br/>Start with A87 (4). Then A04 (203). Then C54 (369). Then B86 (399). Total effort so far:4+203+369+399=975. Remaining:3386-975=2411.<br/><br/>Next, A03 (544) is still a good choice. 975+544=1519, leaving 1867.<br/><br/>Then B41 (720): 1519+720=2239, leaving 3386-2239=1147.<br/><br/>Next, A77 (685): 2239+685=2924, leaving 462.<br/><br/>C01 (539): 2924+539=3463, which is over. So that won&#x27;t work. Maybe add C00 (461): 2924+461=3385, which is within limit. So the set would be A87, A04, C54, B86, A03, B41, A77, C00.<br/><br/>Check the total effort:4+203=207; +369=576; +399=975; +544=1519; +720=2239; +685=2924; +461=3385. Yes, within limit.<br/><br/>Total importance:215(A87)+484(A04)+668(C54)+500(B86)+461(A03)+583(B41)+508(A77)+262(C00) = Let&#x27;s sum:<br/><br/>215+484=699; +668=1367; +500=1867; +461=2328; +583=2911; +508=3419; +262=3681.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s 3681. Previously, my set gave me 3446. So 3681 is better. That&#x27;s an improvement.<br/><br/>Can I do better? Let&#x27;s see. Maybe include C01 (539) instead of C00 (461). But C01&#x27;s effort is higher. Let me check if the total effort allows.<br/><br/>Replacing C00 with C01: effort would be 3385 -461 +539= 3385+78=3463, which is over the limit. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe adding C17 instead of C00? No, C17&#x27;s effort is 313, which is less than C00&#x27;s 461. Wait, total effort was 3385; replacing C00 with C17 would save 461-313=148, allowing me to add another item. What else? Maybe A10 (437) can fit now: 3385 -461=2924, then add C17 (313) and A10 (437). 2924+313=3237, +437=3674, which is under 3386? No, 3674 is over. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after replacing C00 with C17, the effort would be 3385-461+313=3237. Then, how much is left? 3386-3237=149. Any item under 149? Only A87, which is already included. So no gain there.<br/><br/>So perhaps the set A87, A04, C54, B86, A03, B41, A77, C00 gives me 3681, which is better than the previous 3446.<br/><br/>Another thought: B32 has a very low importance (97) but high effort (695). So it&#x27;s probably better to avoid including it unless necessary.<br/><br/>Can I find another combination that gives me higher total importance? Let me see.<br/><br/>If I exclude B41 (720) and include B86 (399) and maybe another item, perhaps. Let me try:<br/><br/>Starting with A87 (4). A04 (203). C54 (369). B86 (399). A03 (544). B41 is out, let&#x27;s see what else. Maybe A77 (685). Then total effort:4+203+369+399+544+685= 4+203=207; +369=576; +399=975; +544=1519; +685=2204. Remaining:3386-2204=1182.<br/><br/>Now, C01 (539) can be added: 2204+539=2743. Remaining:643.<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort under 643. Options are C17 (313), A10 (437), etc. A10 would fit as 437. Adding it would make 2743+437=3180. Remaining:3386-3180=206. Any other items? Maybe C17: 313. But 206 is less than 313, so no.<br/><br/>So the set would be A87, A04, C54, B86, A03, A77, C01, A10. Total effort:4+203+369+399+544+685+539+437. Let me sum:<br/><br/>4+203=207; +369=576; +399=975; +544=1519; +685=2204; +539=2743; +437=3180. That leaves 3386-3180=206. So total effort is 3180. That&#x27;s under the limit, but I could maybe include another item.<br/><br/>Wait, but 3180 is under 3386, so perhaps add C17: 313 fits into 206? No, 313&gt;206. So can&#x27;t add. Alternatively, maybe add B33? No, it&#x27;s too low importance. So this set&#x27;s total importance is:<br/><br/>A87:215 + A04:484 + C54:668 + B86:500 + A03:461 + A77:508 + C01:389 + A10:400. Let&#x27;s sum these:<br/><br/>215+484=699; +668=1367; +500=1867; +461=2328; +508=2836; +389=3225; +400=3625.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s 3625, which is less than the previous 3681. So 3681 is better.<br/><br/>Let me try another combination. What if I include both B41 and B86? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>A87 (4), A04 (203), C54 (369), B41 (720), B86 (399). Total effort:4+203=207 +369=576 +720=1296 +399=1695. Remaining:3386-1695=1691.<br/><br/>Now, add A03 (544): 1695+544=2239. Remaining:1147.<br/><br/>Next, add A77 (685): 2239+685=2924. Remaining:3386-2924=462.<br/><br/>Add C00 (461): 2924+461=3385. Now, remaining is 1. So total effort 3385. The items are A87, A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, C00. The total importance is 215+484+668+583+500+461+508+262. Let&#x27;s sum:<br/><br/>215+484=699; +668=1367; +583=1950; +500=2450; +461=2911; +508=3419; +262=3681. Same as before, total 3681.<br/><br/>So that seems to be a consistent maximum I can reach. Let me see if I can squeeze in another high importance item without exceeding the effort.<br/><br/>What about including A10 instead of C00? Let me see:<br/><br/>Set would be A87, A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, A10. Let&#x27;s check effort:<br/><br/>4+203=207; +369=576; +720=1296; +399=1695; +544=2239; +685=2924; +437=3361. Remaining:25. Can&#x27;t add anything else except maybe A71 (175), which is too big. So effort is 3361, total importance is 215+484+668+583+500+461+508+400. Let&#x27;s sum:<br/><br/>215+484=699; +668=1367; +583=1950; +500=2450; +461=2911; +508=3419; +400=3819.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s 3819, which is better. Wait, does this set&#x27;s total effort fit? Let me check again:<br/><br/>A87:4; A04:203; C54:369; B41:720; B86:399; A03:544; A77:685; A10:437.<br/><br/>Summing efforts: 4+203=207; +369=576; +720=1296; +399=1695; +544=2239; +685=2924; +437=3361. Yes, 3361 is under 3386. Remaining is 25, which isn&#x27;t enough for any other item except perhaps A71 (175), which is too big. So this set is valid. The total importance is 3819, which is higher than the previous 3681.<br/><br/>Wait, that seems better. How did I get a higher total? Because A10 has an importance of 400, which is higher than C00&#x27;s 262. But I removed C00 and added A10 instead. So that&#x27;s a better trade-off. So the new total importance increases by 138 (400-262), from 3681 to 3819.<br/><br/>Is this correct? Let me double-check the math:<br/><br/>C54 (668) is included, which is high. B41 (583), B86 (500), A03 (461), A77 (508), A04 (484), and A10 (400). Yes, that makes sense. So 668+583+500+461+508+484+400= Let&#x27;s add them step by step:<br/><br/>668 (C54) +583 (B41) = 1251; +500 (B86)=1751; +461 (A03)=2212; +508 (A77)=2720; +484 (A04)=3204; +400 (A10)=3604. Plus A87&#x27;s 215: 3604+215=3819. Correct.<br/><br/>This seems like a better set. I should check if there&#x27;s any other combination that can include more high-importance items without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Another idea: Can I include A87, A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, A10, and perhaps another item? Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Current total effort is 3361. Remaining is 25, which is too small for anything except maybe A71 (175), which is too big. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, can I swap any item for another to get a higher importance? For example, if I remove A10 (effort 437, importance 400) and replace it with a combination of smaller items that sum up to similar effort but higher importance.<br/><br/>But 437 is a prime number, so it&#x27;s hard to break into smaller efforts. Let me see which items have effort less than 437 and aren&#x27;t already included.<br/><br/>Available items not in the set: C17 (313), C00 (461), C01 (539), B32 (695), B35 (635), B33 (594), A71 (175), C00 is over. C01 is over. So the only one under 437 is C17 and A71.<br/><br/>If I remove A10 (437) and add C17 (313) and A71 (175), total effort becomes 437-313=124 saved? Wait, no: adding C17 and A71 is 313+175=488, which is more than 437. That&#x27;s 488 &gt;437, so that would require a net addition of 51 effort. Current effort is 3361, adding 51 would make it 3361+51=3412, which is under 3386? No, 3412 is over. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe just add C17 (313), which would require removing A10 (437). So effort would be 3361-437+313=3237. Then, remaining effort is 3386-3237=149. Can I add anything else? C17 is already included, and A71 is 175 which is over. So no.<br/><br/>Therefore, including A10 in the set is better as it gives higher importance than C00, and trying to replace it with smaller items doesn&#x27;t gain us more importance.<br/><br/>So the best set I can make is A87, A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, A10, totaling 3361 effort and 3819 importance.<br/><br/>I should now see if the other participant would accept this, but since I&#x27;m the one making the proposal, I need to think about what they might prioritize. They might have different importance values, perhaps valuing B41, B86, etc., differently. But as I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s attractive to me while hoping the other participant doesn&#x27;t have a better offer.<br/><br/>In my first move, I should probably put forward this set as a proposal. Alternatively, I could start with a slightly smaller set to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal, but given the time constraints, it might be better to propose my best possible set first.<br/><br/>But wait, I might want to consider if the other participant could have a better combination that includes items I don&#x27;t prioritize. So, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes as many high-importance items for me as possible, without giving away too much in terms of effort.<br/><br/>After considering all possible combinations, I think the set A87, A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, A10 is the best for me, giving the highest total importance within the effort limit. Therefore, I&#x27;ll propose this set.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: I calculated the importance-to-effort ratios for each item and prioritized those with the highest ratios. Starting with A87 due to its minimal effort and high importance, I added items like A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, and A10 to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit.

        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to respond in this negotiation game. The user provided a history where they made a proposal and I need to respond accordingly. From the previous messages, I see that the user started with a strategic reasoning and then a proposal. However, when I responded, I didn&#x27;t follow the correct structure, starting with the necessary tag.<br/><br/>I need to correct that by ensuring that my response starts with the STRATEGIC REASONING and follows it with another appropriate tag like PROPOSAL, REFUSE, etc. The goal is to maximize my importance without exceeding the effort limit of 3386. The user&#x27;s initial proposal had a lot of high-importance items, so I should evaluate if accepting it is beneficial or if I should propose a better combination.<br/><br/>Looking at the items, the user&#x27;s proposal includes A87, A04, C54, B41, B86, A03, A77, A10. Let me calculate the total effort for these items:<br/><br/>- A87: 4<br/>- A04: 203<br/>- C54: 369<br/>- B41: 720<br/>- B86: 399<br/>- A03: 544<br/>- A77: 685<br/>- A10: 437<br/><br/>Adding these up: 4 + 203 = 207; 207 + 369 = 576; 576 + 720 = 1296; 1296 + 399 = 1695; 1695 + 544 = 2239; 2239 + 685 = 2924; 2924 + 437 = 3361. That&#x27;s within the limit, as 3361 &lt; 3386.<br/><br/>The total importance for me from these items is:<br/><br/>- A87: 215<br/>- A04: 484<br/>- C54: 668<br/>- B41: 583<br/>- B86: 500<br/>- A03: 461<br/>- A77: 508<br/>- A10: 400<br/><br/>Total: 215 + 484 = 699; 699 + 668 = 1367; 1367 + 583 = 1950; 1950 + 500 = 2450; 2450 + 461 = 2911; 2911 + 508 = 3419; 3419 + 400 = 3819.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a pretty high total. Now, perhaps I can get a better deal by selecting items with higher importance-to-effort ratios. Let me recalculate that for each item:<br/><br/>Importance/Effort:<br/>- A87: 215/4 = 53.75<br/>- A04: 484/203 ≈ 2.386<br/>- C54: 668/369 ≈ 1.808<br/>- B41: 583/720 ≈ 0.809<br/>- B86: 500/399 ≈ 1.254<br/>- A03: 461/544 ≈ 0.847<br/>- A77: 508/685 ≈ 0.742<br/>- C17: 138/313 ≈ 0.440<br/>- B35: 121/635 ≈ 0.191<br/>- A71: 65/175 ≈ 0.371<br/>- C00: 262/461 ≈ 0.568<br/>- A10: 400/437 ≈ 0.915<br/>- B32: 97/695 ≈ 0.140<br/>- B33: 30/594 ≈ 0.0505<br/><br/>From this, A87 has the highest ratio, so it&#x27;s good the user included that. Next, perhaps A04, C54, B86, A03, B41, etc. Maybe including A10 is better than some others.<br/><br/>But wait, the total effort in the proposal is 3361, leaving 25 units spare. Maybe I can swap some lower ratio items with others that give more importance without exceeding the limit. For example, B41 has a low ratio of ~0.809. Maybe replacing it with another item.<br/><br/>Looking for items not in the proposal that have higher ratios:<br/><br/>C17: 0.44, which is lower than B41&#x27;s 0.809. B35: 0.191, lower. A71: 0.371, lower. C00: 0.568, lower than B41. B32 and B33 are even worse. So maybe it&#x27;s better to stick with B41.<br/><br/>Alternatively, see if swapping A77 (ratio ~0.742) with another item. Let&#x27;s see, perhaps C00: 262/461 ≈ 0.568, which is lower. So not better. C54 and B86 are already included.<br/><br/>Perhaps the user&#x27;s proposal is already quite optimal for me. So maybe accepting it is the best move, as it gives a high total importance without exceeding the limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could try to negotiate for more items, but given the limit, adding more would require removing something. Since the user&#x27;s proposal is already within the limit, perhaps I should accept it.<br/><br/>I think the best move is to accept the proposal, as it&#x27;s a strong set for me without exceeding the effort. So I&#x27;ll agree to it.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, I need to respond with the proper structure. The user mentioned that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the strategic reasoning tag. So, I should make sure that the very first structured message is STRATEGIC REASONING. <br/><br/>Looking back, in my last response, I started with AGREE, which was wrong. I need to correct that. The user wants me to include the strategic reasoning first, then the action.<br/><br/>I should analyze why the user&#x27;s proposal is good.
