This approach maximizes my total importance, resulting in a proposal that includes these optimized items.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A10', 'B32', 'B35', 'B86', 'C00', 'C01', 'C54', 'A77', 'A87'}",

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the problem clearly. \n\nWe have two participants, each with their own set of importance values for 14 items. The goal is to agree on a set of items that maximizes each participant's total importance while keeping the total effort below the limit of 4026. The challenge is that I don't know the other participant's importance values, so I need to strategize based on what I know about my own and make educated guesses about theirs.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the items along with their effort and my importance for each. Maybe if I prioritize items that are high in importance to me but low in effort, that could be a good starting point. That way, I can get more value without using up too much of the effort limit. Let me sort the items based on my importance and effort.\n\nLooking at the items:\n\n- C17: Effort 780, Importance 138\n- B41: 742, 583\n- A71: 997, 868\n- C00: 665, 822\n- B35: 140, 783\n- A77: 77, 65\n- A03: 513, 262\n- A04: 383, 121\n- C54: 587, 508\n- C01: 825, 780\n- A87: 319, 461\n- B32: 448, 484\n- B86: 516, 668\n- B33: 694, 389\n- A10: 366, 808\n\nHmm, B35 has a high importance (783) but low effort (140). That seems like a great starting point. Similarly, A77 is low effort (77) but has low importance for me. Maybe I can include A77 if it helps the other person, but it's not a priority for me.\n\nAnother high importance for me is A71 with 868, but it's also high effort (997). If I can include that without exceeding the limit, it's worth it. Similarly, C00 is high importance (822) with effort 665, which is manageable. \n\nLet me try to prioritize items by importance to me, then see how much effort that would take. Starting with the highest importance:\n\n1. A71 (868) - effort 997\n2. C01 (780) - 825\n3. C00 (822) - 665\n4. B41 (583) - 742\n5. A10 (808) - 366\n6. B35 (783) - 140\n7. B86 (668) - 516\n8. A87 (461) - 319\n9. B32 (484) - 448\n10. C54 (508) - 587\n11. B33 (389) - 694\n12. C17 (138) - 780\n13. A03 (262) - 513\n14. A04 (121) - 383\n15. A77 (65) - 77\n\nWait, A10's importance is 808, which is actually the fifth highest, but its effort is 366. That's a good ratio. So maybe I should prioritize A10 above B41.\n\nSo adjusting the priority list:\n\n1. A71 (868) - 997\n2. C01 (780) - 825\n3. C00 (822) - 665\n4. A10 (808) - 366\n5. B41 (583) - 742\n6. B35 (783) - 140\n7. B86 (668) - 516\n8. A87 (461) - 319\n9. B32 (484) - 448\n10. C54 (508) - 587\n11. B33 (389) - 694\n12. C17 (138) - 780\n13. A03 (262) - 513\n14. A04 (121) - 383\n15. A77 (65) - 77\n\nNow, let's calculate the cumulative effort if I take the top items until I hit the limit.\n\nStart with A71: 997. Remaining effort: 4026 - 997 = 3029.\n\nAdd C01: 825. Total so far: 997 + 825 = 1822. Remaining: 4026 - 1822 = 2204.\n\nAdd C00: 665. Total: 1822 + 665 = 2487. Remaining: 4026 - 2487 = 1539.\n\nAdd A10: 366. Total: 2487 + 366 = 2853. Remaining: 4026 - 2853 = 1173.\n\nNext, B41: 742. Total would be 2853 + 742 = 3595. Remaining: 4026 - 3595 = 431.\n\nThen B35: 140. Total 3595 + 140 = 3735. Remaining: 291.\n\nSo far, items: A71, C01, C00, A10, B41, B35.\n\nNext, B86: 516. Adding that would exceed the limit. So skip.\n\nNext, A87: 319. 3735 + 319 = 4054 > 4026, so no.\n\nB32: 448. Too much.\n\nC54: 587. No.\n\nB33: 694. No.\n\nC17: 780. No.\n\nA03: 513. No.\n\nA04: 383. No.\n\nA77: 77. Let's see: 3735 + 77 = 3812. Remaining: 214.\n\nSo add A77. Now, total effort 3812. Remaining: 4026 - 3812 = 214.\n\nAre there any other items that fit? Let's see. The next is A04: 383, which is way over. So maybe that's the limit.\n\nSo the selected items are: A71, C01, C00, A10, B41, B35, A77.\n\nTotal effort: 997 + 825 + 665 + 366 + 742 + 140 +77 = Let me add them step by step.\n\n997 +825 = 1822.\n\n+665=2487.\n\n+366=2853.\n\n+742=3595.\n\n+140=3735.\n\n+77=3812.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the optimal for me. Let's calculate the total importance.\n\nA71:868, C01:780, C00:822, A10:808, B41:583, B35:783, A77:65.\n\nAdding these up:\n\n868 +780 = 1648.\n\n+822=2470.\n\n+808=3278.\n\n+583=3861.\n\n+783=4644.\n\n+65=4709.\n\nThat's a total importance of 4709 for me.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe instead of taking B41 (effort 742, importance 583), maybe another item could give me more. Let me see if I can swap B41 for something else with lower effort but higher importance.\n\nAlternatively, after selecting A71, C01, C00, A10, which uses 997+825+665+366 = let's calculate:\n\n997+825=1822. +665=2487. +366=2853.\n\nSo total effort 2853, remaining effort 4026-2853=1173.\n\nWhat else can I fit in?\n\nInstead of B41 (742) and B35 (140), which uses 742+140=882, maybe I can find items that give me more total importance.\n\nTotal for B41 + B35: importances 583 +783 = 1366.\n\nIf I can find items that sum to <=882 effort and higher importance, that would be better.\n\nLooking at remaining items:\n\nB86: effort 516, imp 668.\n\nAdding B86 gives me 516, which leaves 1173-516=657.\n\nThen, perhaps B32:448, which would total 516+448=964, which is more than 882, so not possible. Or maybe A87:319, which leaves 516+319=835, which is under 882. Then I can add something else.\n\nWait, 516 + 319 =835, with remaining 1173-835=338.\n\nBut 835 is under 882. Maybe adding another item.\n\nFrom the list, perhaps C54:587 is too big, as 516+587=1103 > 882.\n\nB33:694, way too big.\n\nC17:780, too big.\n\nSo maybe after B86 (516) and A87 (319): total 835.\n\nRemaining 1173-835=338.\n\nAny other items with effort <=338?\n\nA77:77, which is 77. So total effort would be 516+319+77=912, which is higher than 882 (which was B41 + B35's effort). But let's calculate the effort with B86, A87, A77: 516+319+77=912.\n\nThat's more than 882, so the total effort would be higher, but let's check the total importance: 668 +461 +65 = 1194.\n\nBut B41 and B35 give me 583 +783 = 1366, which is more than 1194.\n\nSo even though B86 gives me more importance (668 vs B41's 583), adding A87 and A77 gives less overall than B35 and B41. So the initial selection of B41 and B35 is better.\n\nAlternatively, after selecting B86 (516), can I fit anything else?\n\nTotal effort used so far: 2853 +516=3369. Remaining: 4026-3369=657.\n\nWhat's left: B35, B32, A87, etc.\n\nB35 is 140, which can be added with 657-140=517 left. Then perhaps B32 is 448, which is within the remaining. So 140+448=588. Total effort added: 516+140+448=1104. That exceeds the 882 from B41 and B35, so maybe not better.\n\nBut importance would be B86 (668) + B35 (783) + B32 (484) = 668+783=1451 +484=1935. That's more than B41 (583) + B35 (783) = 1366. So that might be better.\n\nWait, but effort-wise, 516+140+448=1104. That would bring the total effort to 2853 (from the first four items) +1104=3957. Remaining 4026-3957=69.\n\nBut 3957 is within the limit (4026). So that's possible.\n\nSo let's recalculate the total importance in that case.\n\nStarting with A71, C01, C00, A10, then adding B86, B35, B32.\n\nImportance: 868 +780 +822 +808 +668 +783 +484.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n868+780=1648.\n\n+822=2470.\n\n+808=3278.\n\n+668=3946.\n\n+783=4729.\n\n+484=5213.\n\nThat's higher than the previous total of 4709.\n\nBut effort used would be 997+825+665+366=2853.\n\nAdding 516+140+448=1104.\n\nTotal effort: 2853+1104=3957. That's within the limit.\n\nSo that gives me a higher total importance. So that's better.\n\nBut wait, can I add more items? Let's see, after adding those, 3957, I have 4026-3957=69 left. Can I add any item with effort ≤69? Let's check the remaining items.\n\nLooking at the initial list, the smallest effort is A77:77, which is above 69. So no, I can't add anything else.\n\nSo the set would be A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, B32. Total effort 3957. Importance 5213.\n\nThat's better than the previous 4709.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can get even higher. Let's see, what if instead of adding B32, I add another item.\n\nAfter B86 (516) and B35 (140), I have 516+140=656 effort. Remaining from 1173 is 1173-656=517.\n\nWait, 1173 is after the first four items: 2853.\n\nSo after adding B86 (516), that's 2853+516=3369. Remaining: 4026-3369=657.\n\nThen adding B35: 140, total 3369+140=3509. Remaining: 517.\n\nNow, can I add B32:448. 448 ≤517. So total effort would be 3509+448=3957. Then remaining: 4026-3957=69, which is less than 77, so nothing else.\n\nImportance: 868+780+822+808+668+783+484= same as before, 5213.\n\nAlternatively, after B86 and B35, can I add A87 (319) instead? That would be 516+140+319=975. That would make the total effort 2853+975=3828. Remaining: 4026-3828=198.\n\nThen, what items are left? Let's see: B32 (448), which is too big. C54:587 too big. B33:694, nope. C17:780, no. A03:513, no. A04:383, no. A77:77, which can fit. So total effort 3828+77=3905. Remaining 4026-3905=121.\n\nAny other items with effort ≤121? A04:383 is too big. A03:513, too big. So just A77. So items would be A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, A87, A77.\n\nImportance: 868+780+822+808+668+783+461+65= Let's add:\n\n868+780=1648.\n\n+822=2470.\n\n+808=3278.\n\n+668=3946.\n\n+783=4729.\n\n+461=5190.\n\n+65=5255.\n\nBut effort:997+825+665+366+516+140+319+77= let's add:\n\n997+825=1822.\n\n+665=2487.\n\n+366=2853.\n\n+516=3369.\n\n+140=3509.\n\n+319=3828.\n\n+77=3905.\n\nSo importance is 5255, which is better than 5213.\n\nBut wait, is this feasible? Let me check, because I added A87 and A77 along with B86 and B35.\n\nWait, the total effort is 3905, which is under the limit, leaving 121 unused. However, I can't add any more items because the remaining items have higher effort than 121 except A77 which I've already added.\n\nSo, that's a better total. But does this make sense? Because I'm including A87 and A77, which have lower importance for me, but B86 and B35 have higher importance. However, in this case, swapping B32 (484) for A87 (461) and adding A77 (65) gives me more total (5255 vs 5213), but I have to give up B32.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, I'm adding A87 and A77 instead of B32, but the effort is actually lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the first case, the set was A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, B32 with importance 5213.\n\nIn the second case, A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, A87, A77 with 5255.\n\nSo higher importance but more items.\n\nBut I think that's better. So perhaps that's a better combination.\n\nWait, but let me check the effort again:\n\n997+825=1822.\n\n+665=2487.\n\n+366=2853.\n\n+516 (B86)=3369.\n\n+140 (B35)=3509.\n\n+319 (A87)=3828.\n\n+77 (A77)=3905.\n\nYes, that's correct. So remaining effort is 4026-3905=121.\n\nSo that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to swap something else? For example, could I include B32 instead of A87 and A77? Let's see:\n\nIf I take A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, B32: effort is 997+825+665+366+516+140+448= Let's add:\n\n997+825=1822.\n\n+665=2487.\n\n+366=2853.\n\n+516=3369.\n\n+140=3509.\n\n+448=3957.\n\nRemaining:4026-3957=69. Can't add anything else.\n\nImportance:868+780+822+808+668+783+484=5213.\n\nSo, even though I can add more items by including A87 and A77, giving me a higher total importance, but I don't know the other person's preferences. Perhaps they value A87 or A77 highly, so including them might make the proposal more acceptable.\n\nBut my goal is to maximize my own total, so I should prioritize my own importance. So, even if it's just me, getting a higher total for myself is better.\n\nSo, I think the set including B86, B35, A87, A77 is better for me, giving me 5255.\n\nBut wait, can I fit both B32 and A87 and A77? Let me see.\n\nAfter A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, that's 2853+516+140=3509.\n\nThen adding B32:448, which would bring it to 3957, and then adding A77:77, total 3957+77=4034, which is over the limit. So that's not possible.\n\nSo I have to choose between adding B32 or adding A87 and A77.\n\nBetween those, adding A87 and A77 gives me more points, so that's better.\n\nSo, I think the best set for me would be A71, C01, C00, A10, B86, B35, A87, A77.\n\nBut I also need to consider that the other player might not agree to this set because it's quite a heavy selection. Maybe they have different priorities. Alternatively, I could consider other combinations that might be more balanced but still beneficial for me.\n\nAnother approach could be to aim for a more moderate selection that the other player might find acceptable, but I don't know their priorities. So perhaps I should make a proposal that includes high-importance items for me but also leaves some room for items that might be high for the other player.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for items that have both high importance for me and low effort, as these are more likely to be acceptable.\n\nLet me think: which items have the best ratio of importance to effort for me?\n\nCalculating importance/effort:\n\nA71:868/997≈0.87\n\nC01:780/825≈0.945\n\nC00:822/665≈1.237\n\nA10:808/366≈2.21\n\nB41:583/742≈0.786\n\nB35:783/140≈5.59\n\nA77:65/77≈0.844\n\nA03:262/513≈0.511\n\nA04:121/383≈0.316\n\nC54:508/587≈0.866\n\nA87:461/319≈1.445\n\nB32:484/448≈1.08\n\nB86:668/516≈1.295\n\nB33:389/694≈0.56\n\nC17:138/780≈0.177\n\nSo the highest ratios are:\n\nB35:5.59 → by far the highest.\n\nA10:2.21\n\nC00:1.237\n\nA87:1.445\n\nB86:1.295\n\nB32:1.08\n\nC54:0.866\n\nC01:0.945\n\nA71:0.87\n\nSo B35 has the highest ratio, so including it is a no-brainer.\n\nThen A10, C00, A87, B86, etc.\n\nSo a possible proposal is to include B35 (140), which is very efficient. Then A10 (366), which is also very efficient.\n\nAdding those two: total effort 140+366=506. Remaining effort 4026-506=3520.\n\nThen next highest ratio is C00 (665, imp 822). Adding that: total effort 506+665=1171. Remaining:4026-1171=2855.\n\nNext, A87:319. Adding that: total 1171+319=1490. Remaining:4026-1490=2536.\n\nNext, B86:516. Adding that: 1490+516=2006. Remaining:4026-2006=2020.\n\nNext, C01:825. Adding that:2006+825=2831. Remaining:4026-2831=1195.\n\nNext, A71:997, which would exceed. So skip.\n\nNext, B32:448. Adding that:2831+448=3279. Remaining:4026-3279=747.\n\nNext, C54:587. Adding that:3279+587=3866. Remaining:4026-3866=160.\n\nNo more items can fit. So the items would be: B35, A10, C00, A87, B86, C01, B32, C54.\n\nTotal importance:783+A10:808+C00:822+A87:461+B86:668+B32:484+C54:508.\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list them all:\n\nB35:783\n\nA10:808\n\nC00:822\n\nA87:461\n\nB86:668\n\nC01:780\n\nB32:484\n\nC54:508\n\nAdding these: 783+808=1591+822=2413+461=2874+668=3542+780=4322+484=4806+508=5314.\n\nThat's a high total for me. Let's check the effort:\n\nB35:140\n\nA10:366 → total 506\n\nC00:665 → 1171\n\nA87:319 →1490\n\nB86:516 →2006\n\nC01:825 →2831\n\nB32:448 →3279\n\nC54:587 →3866\n\nRemaining:4026-3866=160. Can't add anything else.\n\nSo this selection gives me a total importance of 5314, which is higher than the previous 5255.\n\nThis seems even better. But wait, does this selection include all these items without exceeding the effort limit? 3866 ≤4026, yes. But wait, adding all these: B35, A10, C00, A87, B86, C01, B32, C54. That's 8 items. Let me confirm the efforts:\n\n140+366=506 → C00:665 →506+665=1171.\n\nA87:319 →1490.\n\nB86:516 →2006.\n\nC01:825 →2831.\n\nB32:448 →3279.\n\nC54:587 →3866.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo this selection gives me a higher importance:5314.\n\nIs there a way to include even more?\n\nAfter 3866, 4026-3866=160 left. Are there any items with effort ≤160?\n\nLooking back, A77:77, which can be added. So adding A77:77, total effort 3866+77=3943, remaining 4026-3943=83. Can't add anything else. So including A77 adds 65 importance, making it 5314+65=5379.\n\nSo the proposal would be: B35, A10, C00, A87, B86, C01, B32, C54, A77.\n\nEffort:3866+77=3943. Importance:5314+65=5379.\n\nThat's even better.\n\nWait, is there another item I can include? Let me check. After 3943, I have 4026-3943=83. Are there any items with effort ≤83? Looking at the list, the smallest effort is A77:77, which is already included. So no.\n\nSo the final set would include these 9 items. This gives me the highest total importance of 5379.\n\nBut perhaps the other participant would prefer some items that I'm not including, and may not agree to this. So I should consider whether they would accept this set.\n\nAlternatively, I might need to make a proposal and see how they respond.\n\nBut since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should start by proposing the set that gives me the highest possible, even if it's a bit aggressive.\n\nSo my initial proposal would be: {'B35', 'A10', 'C00', 'A87', 'B86', 'C01', 'B32', 'C54', 'A77'}.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the total effort.\n\n140+366=506.\n\n+665=1171.\n\n+319=1490.\n\n+516=2006.\n\n+825=2831.\n\n+448=3279.\n\n+587=3866.\n\n+77=3943.\n\nYes, 3943 ≤4026.\n\nAnd the importance is 783+808+822+461+668+780+484+508+65= let's add:\n\n783+808=1591.\n\n+822=2413.\n\n+461=2874.\n\n+668=3542.\n\n+780=4322.\n\n+484=4806.\n\n+508=5314.\n\n+65=5379.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nI think this is the best I can do without knowing the other player's preferences. So I'll propose this set.\n"

So, the goal is to maximize my own total importance while ensuring the total effort doesn't exceed 4026. I don't know the other player's importance values, so I need to make strategic choices based on my own priorities and anticipate what the opponent might prefer.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the items with their effort and my importance. I need to prioritize items that give me the highest importance per unit of effort because that will allow me to maximize my total importance without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nLooking at each item:\n\n- A10: 366 effort, 808 importance\n- A03: 513, 262\n- A04: 383, 121\n- A77: 77, 65\n- A71: 997, 868\n- A87: 319, 461\n\nFor B items:\n\n- B35: 140, 783\n- B32: 448, 484\n- B41: 742, 583\n- B33: 694, 389\n- B86: 516, 668\n\nFor C items:\n\n- C00: 665, 822\n- C01: 825, 780\n- C17: 780, 138\n- C54: 587, 508\n\nI should sort them by importance per effort. Let's calculate that ratio for each item:\n\n- B35: 783/140 ≈ 5.59\n- A10: 808/366 ≈ 2.21\n- B86: 668/516 ≈ 1.29\n- C00: 822/665 ≈ 1.24\n- C54: 508/587 ≈ 0.866\n- B32: 484/448 ≈ 1.08\n- B41: 583/742 ≈ 0.786\n- A71: 868/997 ≈ 0.871\n- A87: 461/319 ≈ 1.445\n- C01: 780/825 ≈ 0.945\n- B33: 389/694 ≈ 0.561\n- C17: 138/780 ≈ 0.177\n- A04: 121/383 ≈ 0.316\n- A03: 262/513 ≈ 0.511\n- A77: 65/77 ≈ 0.844\n\nSo, the order from highest to lowest importance per effort is:\n\n1. B35 (5.59)\n2. A10 (2.21)\n3. A87 (1.445)\n4. B86 (1.29)\n5. C00 (1.24)\n6. B32 (1.08)\n7. C54 (0.866)\n8. A71 (0.871) – wait, actually, this is higher than B32\n9. C01 (0.945)\n10. B41 (0.786)\n11. A87 was already placed, so moving on\n12. A77 (0.844)\n13. B33 (0.561)\n14. A03 (0.511)\n15. C17 (0.177)\n16. A04 (0.316)\n17. A04 is lower than A03.\n\nWait, I need to correct the order. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. B35\n2. A10\n3. A87\n4. B86\n5. C00\n6. A71 (since 0.871 > B32's 1.08? Wait, no. 0.871 is less than 1.08. So B32 comes next.\nWait, no. B86 is 1.29, C00 is 1.24, then B32 is 1.08, then A71 is 0.871.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to sort them correctly.\n\nWait, the correct order by importance per effort descending:\n\n1. B35 (5.59)\n2. A10 (2.21)\n3. A87 (1.445)\n4. B86 (1.29)\n5. C00 (1.24)\n6. B32 (1.08)\n7. C01 (0.945)\n8. A71 (0.871)\n9. C54 (0.866)\n10. B41 (0.786)\n11. A77 (0.844)\n12. B33 (0.561)\n13. A03 (0.511)\n14. A04 (0.316)\n15. C17 (0.177)\n\nWait, A77 (0.844) comes after C54 (0.866). So actually, it would be:\n\nAfter B32 (1.08), then C01 (0.945), then A71 (0.871), then C54 (0.866), then A77 (0.844), etc.\n\nSo the order is:\n\n1. B35\n2. A10\n3. A87\n4. B86\n5. C00\n6. B32\n7. C01\n8. A71\n9. C54\n10. A77\n11. B41\n12. B33\n13. A03\n14. A04\n15. C17\n\nNow, starting to pick items in this order until the total effort reaches the limit.\n\nStart with B35: effort 140, total=140, importance=783\n\nAdd A10: 140+366=506, total importance 783+808=1591\n\nAdd A87: 506+319=825, importance 1591+461=2052\n\nAdd B86: 825+516=1341, importance 2052+668=2720\n\nAdd C00: 1341+665=2006, importance 2720+822=3542\n\nAdd B32: 2006+448=2454, importance 3542+484=4026\n\nNext item is C01: effort 825, which would bring total effort to 2454+825=3279, which is over the limit. So we can't add it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can skip B32 and add C01? Let's see:\n\nAfter C00, total effort 2006, importance 3542.\n\nAdding C01: 2006 + 825 = 2831, which is within the limit. Importance 3542 + 780 = 4322. That's better than adding B32 which would give 3542 + 484 = 4026 and effort 2454, leaving more space.\n\nWait, but C01 has 780 importance vs B32's 484, so C01 is better. So perhaps it's better to pick C01 over B32. Let's recalculate.\n\nSo after adding C00, total effort 2006, add C01: 2006 + 825 = 2831, under 4026. Now total importance 3542 + 780 = 4322.\n\nNext, can we add more items? Let's see how much effort is left: 4026 - 2831 = 1195.\n\nLooking at the next items in priority: A71 (997). Adding A71 would exceed the limit (2831 + 997 = 3828 > 4026? 4026 - 2831 is 1195, and 997 is less than that. So adding A71: total effort 2831 + 997 = 3828, and importance 4322 + 868 = 5190.\n\nRemaining effort: 4026 - 3828 = 198.\n\nNext, see what items can fit. Next in line is C54 (587), which is too big. Then A77 (77). Let's add A77: 3828 + 77 = 3905, importance 5190 + 65 = 5255.\n\nRemaining effort: 4026 - 3905 = 121. Next, B41 (742) is too big. B33 (694) is too big. A03 (513). No. A04 (383). No. C17 (780). No. So maybe we can't add anything else. So the set is B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, C01, A71, A77. Effort 3905, importance 5255.\n\nBut wait, maybe after adding C00 and C01, adding A71, A77, and maybe other small items. Let's check if after adding C01, we have effort 2831, adding A71 (997) brings to 3828, then adding A77 (77) to 3905. Then, with 121 left, nothing else fits except maybe A04 (383) is too big. So yes, total items: B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, C01, A71, A77.\n\nBut is there a better combination? Maybe swapping C01 with B32 and adding more.\n\nWait, what's the total if I go back and instead of adding C01 after C00, add B32 and then others.\n\nSo after C00, effort 2006, add B32 (448) for total 2454. Importance 3542 + 484 = 4026. Remaining effort: 4026 - 2454 = 1572. Then add C01 (825), total 2454 + 825 = 3279, importance 4026 + 780 = 4806. Remaining effort: 4026 - 3279 = 747.\n\nNext, can we add A71 (997)? 3279 + 997 = 4276 which exceeds limit. So no. What's next? C54 (587). 3279 + 587 = 3866. Importance 4806 + 508 = 5314. Remaining effort: 4026 - 3866 = 160. Can't add any more.\n\nSo the set is B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, B32, C01, C54. Total effort 3866, which is under.\n\nAnother option is to see if adding both B32 and C01 and C54 gives a higher total than the previous set.\n\nWait, in the previous path with C01, A71, A77, total importance is 5255, which is higher than 5314? No, 5314 is higher than 5255. So 5314 is better.\n\nWait, 5314 vs 5255? 5314 is higher, so this combination is better.\n\nSo the set would be B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, B32, C01, C54. Let's check total effort: B35=140, A10=366, A87=319, B86=516, C00=665, B32=448, C01=825, C54=587. Wait, adding all these: 140+366=506, +319=825, +516=1341, +665=2006, +448=2454, +825=3279, +587=3866. Yes, that's correct. So 3866 effort, within limit.\n\nImportance: 783 + 808 = 1591, +461=2052, +668=2720, +822=3542, +484=4026, +780=4806, +508=5314.\n\nNow, what about adding A77? 3866 +77=3943, which is under 4026. So adding A77: importance 5314 +65=5379. That's better. So total items: B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, B32, C01, C54, A77. Total effort: 3866+77=3943, which is under 4026.\n\nRemaining effort: 4026 -3943=83. Any other small items left? A04 is 383, too big. A03 is 513, too big. So nothing else fits. So total importance is 5379.\n\nIs that the maximum? Let me check another path.\n\nWhat if after B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, instead of adding B32 and C01, I add C01 first? Let's see:\n\nTotal after C00: 2006. Adding C01 (825): 2829. Importance: 3542 +780=4322. Then add B32 (448): 2829+448=3277. Importance: 4322 +484=4806. Then add A71 (997): over limit. Or add C54 (587): 3277 +587=3864. Then add A77 (77): 3941. Then add nothing else. So importance 4806+508+65=5379. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, could I add A71 instead of B32 and C54? Let's see:\n\nAfter C01: 2829 effort, importance 4322. Adding A71 (997) would bring to 3826, importance 4322 +868=5190. Remaining effort: 4026-3826=200. Then add C54 (587) is too big. Add B32 (448): 3826+448=4274, importance 5190 +484=5674. Then add A77: 4274+77=4351. Remaining: 4026-4351 is negative, so can't. So, with this path, effort is 3826 (after adding A71) and remaining effort 200. Could add A77 (77) and have 3826 +77=3903, importance 5190+65=5255. Then remaining effort 4026-3903=123. Can't add anything else. So the total importance is 5255, which is less than the 5379 from the other path.\n\nTherefore, the better set is B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, C01, B32, C54, A77 with total importance 5379.\n\nIs there any other combination that gives higher importance? What if I swap C54 for something else? Let's see: after adding C01, B32, C54, and A77, the effort is 3866+77=3943. Remaining 83. Is there any other item that gives higher importance than C54? Let me check C54: importance 508 for 587 effort. If I remove C54 and see if any other items can be added. For example, adding B41 (742, importance 583). 3943 -587 +742= 3943+155=4100, which exceeds the limit. No, can't. Alternatively, removing C54 and A77 and adding a higher importance item? Let's see, perhaps B41. 3866 +742=4608, over limit. So no. So C54 and A77 are better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not adding B32 and instead adding more items. Let me see: after C00, C01, effort 2006 +825=2829, importance 3542 +780=4322. Instead of adding B32 (448), perhaps adding B86 is already included, can't. Maybe adding A71 (997). 2829 +997=3826, importance 4322 +868=5190. Then adding C54 (587) would make 3826 +587=4413, over limit. So can't. Alternatively, adding A04 (383). 3826 +383=4209, remaining 4026-4209 is negative. So no. Alternatively, adding A03 (513). 3826 +513=4339, over limit. So no. Adding A77 (77) to 3826: 3903, remaining 4026-3903=123. Can't add anything. So total is 5190 +65=5255, which is less than 5379.\n\nSo the earlier combination is better.\n\nAnother consideration: what if I take B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, C01, C54, B32, A77. Wait, that's the same as before.\n\nI think the maximum I can get is 5379.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to include A71 without excluding other high-importance items? Let's see: perhaps swapping some lower importance items.\n\nFor example, if I remove C54 (508) and include A71 (868). Let's see the effort: 3866 -587 +997= 3866 +410=4276, which is over the limit (4276>4026). So can't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove C54 and B32 (508+484=992), then add A71 (868) and something else? 992 -868=124 saved. So if I remove B32 and C54 (total effort 448+587=1035) and add A71 (997), saving 38. Then I could add other items? Let's recalculate:\n\nWithout B32 and C54, the total effort would be 3866 -448 -587= 3830. Adding A71: 3830 +997=4827, over limit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe drop lower importance items. For example, if I remove A77 (65 importance) and C54 (508), total importance loss is 573, but then add A71 (868) and perhaps something else. The effort saved is 587 +77=664. So total effort would be 3866 -664=3202, then add A71: 3202 +997=4199, which is under limit. Then add other items: what's left? The remaining effort is 4026-4199=negative, so no. So the new set would be B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, C01, A71, B32. Effort: 140+366+319+516+665+825+997+448 = let's calculate step by step.\n\n140+366=506, +319=825, +516=1341, +665=2006, +825=2831, +997=3828, +448=4276. Which is over the limit. So I can't do that.\n\nThis seems tricky. It looks like the initial set I have is the best possible in terms of maximizing my importance without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nSo, I'll go with the set: B35, A10, A87, B86, C00, C01, B32, C54, A77. Let me check the total effort: 140+366=506, +319=825, +516=1341, +665=2006, +448=2454, +825=3279, +587=3866, +77=3943. Yes, that's within 4026. Importance is 783+808+461+668+822+780+484+508+65= Let's calculate: 783+808=1591, +461=2052, +668=2720, +822=3542, +780=4322, +484=4806, +508=5314, +65=5379. That's the maximum I can achieve.\n\nI think I should propose this set, but maybe the other player will have their own priorities, so they might refuse it. I need to be ready to adjust, perhaps by swapping some items if the other player’s PROPOSAL is better for me or if I need to compromise.\n\nAnother thought: the other player might prioritize different items, maybe they have high importance for some items I consider low. So they might not accept a proposal that excludes their high-importance items. But since I don't know their priorities, I have to start with my best possible set and be prepared to negotiate further.\n\nMaybe I can try to include items that I think are also valuable to them, but not sure. Alternatively, I can propose my best set and see their response.\n\nIn the initial PROPOSAL, the items were {'A10', 'B32', 'B35', 'B86', 'C00', 'C01', 'C54', 'A77', 'A87'}, which includes the same as my optimized set except it's missing A71 and includes A77. Wait, no, in my optimized set, I included A77. So maybe the initial proposal was already good, but let me check.\n\nWait, in my initial message, I proposed {'A10', 'B32', 'B35', 'B86', 'C00', 'C01', 'C54', 'A77', 'A87'}, which includes 9 items. The total effort: A10=366, B32=448, B35=140, B86=516, C00=665, C01=825, C54=587, A77=77, A87=319.\n\nCalculating total effort: 366+448=814, +140=954, +516=1470, +665=2135, +825=2960, +587=3547, +77=3624, +319=3943. Total effort 3943, which is within 4026. Importance: A10=808, B32=484, B35=783, B86=668, C00=822, C01=780, C54=508, A77=65, A87=461. Total importance: 808+484=1292, +783=2075, +668=2743, +822=3565, +780=4345, +508=4853, +65=4918, +461=5379.\n\nSo this set gives me 5379, same as my optimized set. So the initial PROPOSAL is already the best I can get. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.\n"
