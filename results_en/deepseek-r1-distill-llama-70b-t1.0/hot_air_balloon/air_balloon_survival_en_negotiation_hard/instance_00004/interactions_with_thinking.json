So, the goal is to pick a set of items that maximize my total importance without exceeding the total effort limit of 5138. I don't know the other player's importance values, which makes it a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the items along with both their effort and my importance for each. That way, I can see which items are most valuable to me relative to their cost. Let me jot them down:\n\n- C17: Effort 903, Importance 138\n- B41: 757, 583\n- A71: 850, 868\n- C00: 746, 822\n- B35: 524, 783\n- A77: 204, 65\n- A03: 946, 262\n- A04: 473, 121\n- C54: 616, 508\n- C01: 855, 780\n- A87: 530, 461\n- B32: 419, 484\n- B86: 960, 668\n- B33: 763, 389\n- A10: 730, 808\n\nLooking at this, I notice that some items have a higher importance per unit of effort. For example, B41 has an importance of 583 with effort 757, which is a decent ratio. Others, like A77, have very low importance (65) despite low effort (204), so it's probably not worth including unless necessary.\n\nI think the best way to maximize my total importance is to prioritize items with the highest importance per effort ratio. So, I should calculate that ratio for each item:\n\n- B41: 583/757 \u2248 0.77\n- A71: 868/850 \u2248 1.02\n- C00: 822/746 \u2248 1.10\n- B35: 783/524 \u2248 1.49\n- A77: 65/204 \u2248 0.32\n- A03: 262/946 \u2248 0.277\n- A04: 121/473 \u2248 0.256\n- C54: 508/616 \u2248 0.825\n- C01: 780/855 \u2248 0.912\n- A87: 461/530 \u2248 0.87\n- B32: 484/419 \u2248 1.15\n- B86: 668/960 \u2248 0.70\n- B33: 389/763 \u2248 0.51\n- A10: 808/730 \u2248 1.11\n\nFrom this, the top ratios are B35 (1.49), C00 (1.10), A71 (1.02), B32 (1.15), A10 (1.11), and B41 (0.77). It seems like B35 is the most efficient, followed by C00, B32, A10, A71, and B41.\n\nNow, I need to select a combination of these items without exceeding the effort limit of 5138. I'll try adding them one by one starting from the highest ratio.\n\n1. Start with B35 (524). Total effort so far: 524.\n2. Add C00 (746). Total: 524 + 746 = 1270.\n3. Next, A71 (850). Total: 1270 + 850 = 2120.\n4. Then, B32 (419). Total: 2120 + 419 = 2539.\n5. Add A10 (730). Total: 2539 + 730 = 3269.\n6. Next, B41 (757). Total: 3269 + 757 = 4026.\n7. Now, check if we can add another high-ratio item. A87 is next with 530. Adding it would bring total to 4026 + 530 = 4556, which is under 5138. So, include A87.\n8. Total now: 4556. Next, check if any other items can fit. C54 has effort 616. Adding it would bring total to 4556 + 616 = 5172, which is over the limit. Maybe swap C54 for lower effort items? Alternatively, consider C01 (855) or C17 (903). But both are too big. Maybe omit A87 and include C54? Let's see:\n\nIf I remove A87 (530), the total is 4026. Then add C54 (616): 4026 + 616 = 4642. Now, perhaps add another item. Let's see, next is C01 (855) which would bring it to 5497\u2014too much. Alternatively, B86 (960 is too high). Maybe C17 (903) brings total to 4642 + 903 = 5545\u2014no. So, perhaps keeping A87 is better because it gives me more importance than C54.\n\nAlternatively, let me calculate the total importance of the current selection:\n\nB35 (783) + C00 (822) + A71 (868) + B32 (484) + A10 (808) + B41 (583) + A87 (461) = Let me add these up step by step:\n\n783 + 822 = 1605\n1605 + 868 = 2473\n2473 + 484 = 2957\n2957 + 808 = 3765\n3765 + 583 = 4348\n4348 + 461 = 4809\n\nTotal importance: 4809.\n\nAlternatively, if I swap A87 (461) for C54 (508), the total would be 4809 - 461 + 508 = 4856. That's an increase of 47. Then, check if total effort allows. So, removing A87 (530) and adding C54 (616) would increase effort by 86. So total effort becomes 4556 - 530 + 616 = 4642. That's under 5138, and total importance is higher: 4348 + 508 - 461 = 4348 + 47 = 4395? Wait, wait, no\u2014wait. Original total without A87 is 4348 (from 783+822+868+484+808+583). Then, adding C54 (508) brings it to 4348 + 508 = 4856, and effort is 4026 + 616 = 4642. That's better in terms of importance, and under the limit. So maybe this is a better combination.\n\nBut then, can I add more? Let me check the remaining effort: 4642. 5138 - 4642 = 496. Are there any items with effort <=496 that I haven't included yet? Let's see:\n\nA77: 204, importance 65\nC17: 903 (too big)\nA03: 946 (too big)\nA04: 473\nB33: 763 (too big)\nB86: 960 (too big)\nC01: 855 (too big)\nSo remaining items with effort under 496: A77 (204, 65), A03 (too big), A04 (473), B32 is already included. Wait, A04:473 is over 496? No, 473 is under 496. So can I add A04? Let's see:\n\nAdding A04: effort +473, total becomes 4642 + 473 = 5115, which is under 5138. Total importance becomes 4856 + 121 = 4977.\n\nIs that better? 121 more importance for 473 effort. It's a lower ratio, but since we can fit it, it's better to include. So now the set would be:\n\nB35, C00, A71, B32, A10, B41, C54, A04.\n\nTotal effort: 524 + 746 + 850 + 419 + 730 + 757 + 616 + 473 = Let me add:\n\n524 + 746 = 1270\n1270 + 850 = 2120\n2120 + 419 = 2539\n2539 + 730 = 3269\n3269 + 757 = 4026\n4026 + 616 = 4642\n4642 + 473 = 5115\n\nTotal effort is 5115, leaving 23 unused. Total importance is 783+822+868+484+808+583+508+121= 783+822=1605; 1605+868=2473; 2473+484=2957; 2957+808=3765; 3765+583=4348; 4348+508=4856; 4856+121=4977.\n\nAlternatively, could I include A04 and perhaps another item? The remaining effort after adding A04 is 23, which is too small for any other item. So perhaps adding A04 is beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could include A77 instead for 65 importance with 204 effort. But 204 is more than 23, so I can't add both A04 and A77. Let me check:\n\nIf I remove A04 (473) and add A77 (204), then the effort would be 5115 - 473 + 204 = 5115 - 269 = 4846, and importance would be 4977 - 121 + 65 = 4921, which is worse. So adding A04 is better.\n\nAnother thought: maybe instead of including A87, C54, and A04, there might be a better combination. Let me consider what happens if I include both A04 and C54 without A87. So the set would be B35, C00, A71, B32, A10, B41, C54, A04.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Alternatively, could I include A77 and A04? No, because A04 alone gives more importance than A77.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a better combination by swapping some items. For example, if I drop B41 (effort 757, importance 583) and instead include items that together give more importance with less effort.\n\nLet me see: if I remove B41 (effort 757, importance 583), I can add:\n\nB41's effort is 757. If I remove it, I free up 757 effort. What's the best way to use that?\n\nI could perhaps add A04 (473, 121) and another item. Let's check if anything else can fit. The remaining effort would be 757. Let's see, adding A87 (530, 461) would take 530, leaving 227. I could add B32 (419, 484) but that's too big. Wait, no, B32 is already included. Alternatively, after adding A87, I have 227 left. Can I add something like C17? No, 903 too big. A03? 946 too big. C54 is 616, which is less than 757. Wait, if I remove B41 and add C54 and A87, let's see:\n\nC54: 616, A87:530. Together, 616+530=1146, which is less than 757? No, 1146 is more than 757, so I can't do that. So, perhaps it's better to stick with B41.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swapping B41 with a combination of A04 and A87. Let's calculate the total effort and importance:\n\nB41 is 757 effort, 583 importance.\n\nIf I remove B41, maybe add A87 (530, 461) and A04 (473, 121). But their combined effort is 530+473=1003. Since B41 was 757, I can't add both because 1003>757. Alternatively, maybe add one of them.\n\nIf I add A87, effort becomes 530, leaving 757-530=227. But I can't add anything else with 227 except A77 (204, 65). So the total effort becomes 530+204=734, which is acceptable (under 757). But the importance is 461+65=526, which is less than B41's 583. So it's worse.\n\nAlternatively, add A04 (473,121) and with remaining effort 757-473=284, I can't add anything except A77 (204,65). So total effort 473+204=677, leaving 80 unused. Total importance 121+65=186, which is way less than 583. So again, worse.\n\nSo keeping B41 is better.\n\nAnother approach: Let me try to prioritize the top items and see if I can fit as many as possible without exceeding the limit.\n\nStart with B35 (524, 783). Remaining effort: 5138-524=4614.\n\nAdd C00 (746,822). Remaining: 4614-746=3868.\n\nAdd A71 (850,868). Remaining: 3868-850=3018.\n\nAdd B32 (419,484). Remaining: 3018-419=2599.\n\nAdd A10 (730,808). Remaining: 2599-730=1869.\n\nAdd B41 (757,583). Remaining: 1869-757=1112.\n\nAt this point, I can consider adding items with effort \u22641112.\n\nC54 is 616, which is under 1112. Let's add C54 (616,508). Remaining: 1112-616=496.\n\nNow, can I add A04 (473,121). 473 is under 496. Adding it would leave 496-473=23. So total effort is 524+746+850+419+730+757+616+473= let me add:\n\n524+746=1270\n+850=2120\n+419=2539\n+730=3269\n+757=4026\n+616=4642\n+473=5115\n\nRemaining effort: 23. Total importance: 783+822+868+484+808+583+508+121= 783+822=1605; +868=2473; +484=2957; +808=3765; +583=4348; +508=4856; +121=4977.\n\nIs there any way to improve this? Maybe swap some lower importance items.\n\nLooking at the current set, the items with the lowest importance per effort are A04 (121/473\u22480.256) and A77 isn't even included yet. Wait, perhaps including A77 instead of A04 would give more importance, but A77's importance is 65, which is lower than A04's 121. So better to keep A04.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove A04 and A87 and include C54, but I think that was considered earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include C01 instead of some other item. C01 has 780 importance and 855 effort. Let's see if swapping C01 for B41 would be better.\n\nB41: 757 effort, 583 importance.\n\nC01: 855 effort, 780 importance.\n\nDifference in effort: 855-757=98 more. Importance difference: 780-583=197 more. So, even though it uses more effort, it gives more importance. Let's see if we can fit it.\n\nCurrent total without B41: 524+746+850+419+730+616+473= Wait, no, I need to remove B41 and see the new total. If I remove B41 (757), I have to adjust the set.\n\nLet me recalculate the set without B41:\n\nInclude B35, C00, A71, B32, A10, C54, A04, and add C01.\n\nBut wait, B35 (524) + C00 (746) = 1270.\n\n+ A71 (850) = 2120.\n\n+ B32 (419) = 2539.\n\n+ A10 (730) = 3269.\n\n+ C54 (616) = 4642.\n\n+ A04 (473) = 5115.\n\nNow, to add C01 (855), which would bring effort to 5115 + 855 = 5970, which exceeds 5138. So I can't include C01 without removing some items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace some items to include C01.\n\nLet me see, replacing B41 (757) with C01 (855). The difference is +98 effort, but +197 importance.\n\nSo, if I remove B41 and add C01, the total effort becomes 524+746+850+419+730+855+616+473.\n\nLet me add:\n\n524+746=1270\n\n+850=2120\n\n+419=2539\n\n+730=3269\n\n+855=4124\n\n+616=4740\n\n+473=5213.\n\nWait, that's 5213, which is under 5138? No, 5213 is above 5138. So that would exceed the limit. So I can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can remove more than one item to fit C01. Suppose I remove B41 and A04.\n\nSo, total effort would be 524+746+850+419+730+616= 524+746=1270 +850=2120 +419=2539 +730=3269 +616=3885. Now, adding C01 (855) brings it to 3885+855=4740, which is under 5138. Then, I can also add A04 (473) because 4740+473=5213, which is over. Alternatively, perhaps add A04 without C01, but that's what I had before.\n\nWait, no, the goal is to include as much as possible. So including C01 and A04 would exceed, so maybe just C01 and see if other items can fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remove both B41 and another low-importance item to fit C01.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what's the total importance if I include C01 instead of B41 and A04.\n\nIf I remove B41 (583) and A04 (121), I lose 704 importance. If I add C01 (780), I gain 780, but I have to consider if I can fit it with other items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's not worth it because the effort increase is significant, and the gain in importance is 780 - 583 = 197, but only with more effort. But since it's over the limit, maybe it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include C01 and A04 instead of B41. Let me check:\n\nTotal effort without B41: 524+746+850+419+730+616+473= as before, 5115.\n\nIf I remove A04 (473) and add C01 (855), the effort becomes 5115 - 473 + 855 = 5115 + 382 = 5497, which is over 5138. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remove both B41 and A04, add C01 and see if other items can be included.\n\nTotal effort after removing B41 and A04: 524+746+850+419+730+616= Let me add:\n\n524+746=1270 +850=2120 +419=2539 +730=3269 +616=3885.\n\nNow, adding C01 (855): 3885+855=4740. Then, I have 5138-4740=398 left. Can I add something else? A04 is already removed, but A87 is 530, which is too big. Alternatively, maybe add B33 (763), but that's over. Alternatively, B86 (960) is too big. So, maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nTotal importance in this scenario: 783 (B35) +822 (C00) +868 (A71) +484 (B32) +808 (A10) +780 (C01) = Let me add:\n\n783+822=1605 +868=2473 +484=2957 +808=3765 +780=4545.\n\nThat's lower than the previous total of 4977, so it's worse. Therefore, it's better to stick with the previous set.\n\nAnother idea: What if I include A77? It's only 204 effort for 65 importance. It's not great, but perhaps if I can fit it, it's better than nothing. Let me see.\n\nIn the current set with total effort 5115, I have 23 left. A77 needs 204, which I can't fit. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove A04 (473) to free up effort. Then I can add A77 (204), but that would leave me with 473-204=269 unused. Alternatively, is there anything else I can add?\n\nBut since I can't fit more than A77 (204) into the remaining effort, and it's better to have A04 (121) than nothing, I think it's better to keep A04.\n\nWait, 473-204=269, but I can't add anything else with that. So, perhaps it's better to just include A77 instead of A04, but since 121 >65, it's better to keep A04.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps excluding both A04 and A77 and keeping the effort lower. But 473 is a lot of effort for just 121, but it's better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider if I can swap A04 for another item. Let's see, if I remove A04, the effort saved is 473. What can I add with that? Maybe add A87 (530, 461) but that's 530, which is more than 473, so can't. Alternatively, add A77 (204,65) and have 473-204=269 left, but nothing else fits. So, better to keep A04.\n\nI think the initial set is the best I can do, giving me a total importance of 4977 with effort 5115, leaving 23 unused.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of including A87 as well, but that would push effort beyond. So, perhaps my initial selection without A04 and replacing with C54 is actually better.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nEarlier, I thought of including B35, C00, A71, B32, A10, B41, C54, and A04, which gave a total importance of 783+822+868+484+808+583+508+121=4977, effort 5115.\n\nAlternatively, swapping A04 and C54 for something else? Or perhaps adding another item.\n\nWait, another thought: A87 (530, 461). It's a decent importance. If I could include it without exceeding the limit, that would be better.\n\nSo, let me see. If I remove A04 (473,121) and add A87 (530,461), the effort changes by 530-473=57 more. So total effort becomes 5115 - 473 +530=5115+57=5172, which is under 5138? No, 5172>5138. So that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, if I can remove another item along with A04 to fit A87.\n\nFor example, remove B32 (419,484) and add A87. Let's see:\n\neffort change: 530-419=111 more. So total effort becomes 5115 -419 +530=5115 +111=5226, which is over.\n\nAlternatively, remove B32 and A04, and add A87. That frees up 419+473=892, and adds 530, so net change -362. Total effort becomes 5115 -892 +530=5115-362=4753. Then, can I add other items?\n\nTotal effort is now 4753, with 5138-4753=385 left. Can I add C54 (616) which is over 385? No. Or B33 (763) which is over. Alternatively, A77 (204) and have 385-204=181 left, but nothing else fits. So, the total importance in this scenario would be:\n\n783+B35, 822+C00, 868+A71, 808+A10, 583+B41, 461+A87, 121+A04. Wait, no\u2014I removed B32 and A04, but added A87. So the total importance is 783+822+868+808+583+461= 783+822=1605 +868=2473 +808=3281 +583=3864 +461=4325. Then, with the remaining effort, I added A77 (65) and A04 is removed. Wait, no, in this case, I removed A04 as well. So total is 4325 -121 (from A04) +65 (A77) but wait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating it.\n\nThis approach seems to lower the total importance, so it's not beneficial.\n\nI think I should stick with the initial set: B35, C00, A71, B32, A10, B41, C54, A04, totaling 4977 importance and 5115 effort.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's the maximum. Let me consider if I can include another high-value item without removing anything.\n\nLooking back, the only item I haven't included yet that could add more importance is B86 (960,668), but its effort is too high. Even if I remove some items to include it, the effort required (960) would need to be balanced by removing items with total effort >=960. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nFor example, if I remove B41 (757), A04 (473), and A77 (204), that's 757+473+204=1434. Then I can add B86 (960), and have 1434-960=474 left. But that would require removing multiple items, which may not be efficient. The importance change would be:\n\nRemove B41 (583), A04 (121), A77 (65): total removed 583+121+65=769.\n\nAdd B86 (668). Net change: 668-769= -101. So it's worse.\n\nAlternatively, remove fewer items. Maybe remove A04 and A77 (473+204=677), add B86 (960). But that would exceed the effort by 677 -960= -283, which isn't allowed. So I can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, remove B41 (757), add B86 (960). That would increase effort by 203. Since the current effort is 5115, adding 203 would make it 5318, which is over 5138. So no.\n\nTherefore, including B86 isn't feasible without reducing the total importance.\n\nSimilarly, C17 has 903 effort, 138 importance, which isn't worth it.\n\nAnother thought: Let me see if I can include both B35 and B32, which are both B items. Maybe there's a way to include more high-importance items. But I think the current selection is already optimal.\n\nSo, I think the best set is:\n\n{'B35', 'C00', 'A71', 'B32', 'A10', 'B41', 'C54', 'A04'}\n\nTotal effort: 5115.\n\nTotal importance: 4977.\n\nI don't think I can get anything better than this without exceeding the effort limit. So I'll propose this set.\n",

                    "content": "Alright, let's figure out the best way to approach this negotiation. I need to maximize my importance while keeping the total effort under 5138. I'll start by looking at each item's importance and effort.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item to see which ones give me the most bang for the buck. \n\n- B35: 783/524 = ~1.49\n- C00: 822/746 = ~1.10\n- A71: 868/850 = ~1.02\n- B32: 484/419 = ~1.15\n- A10: 808/730 = ~1.11\n- B41: 583/757 = ~0.77\n- C54: 508/616 = ~0.82\n- A04: 121/473 = ~0.256\n\nFrom this, B35 is my top priority because it has the highest ratio. I'll include that first. Next, A71 is important, but its ratio is lower than some others, so maybe I need to prioritize based on importance and effort combined.\n\nI'll consider the total effort if I include B35, C00, and A71:\n903 (C17) seems high but B35, C00, A71, etc., might add up. Let me add up their efforts:\n\nB35: 524\nC00: 746\nA71: 850\nB32: 419\nA10: 730\nB41: 757\nC54: 616\nA04: 473\n\nWait, that's already 5,146, which is way over the limit. I need to be more careful.\n\nLet me start selecting step by step:\n\n1. B35 (524) - Total effort: 524\n2. A71 (850) - Total: 1,374\n3. A10 (730) - Total: 2,104\n4. C00 (746) - Total: 2,850\n5. B32 (419) - Total: 3,269\n6. C54 (616) - Total: 3,885\n7. B41 (757) - Total: 4,642\n8. A04 (473) - Total: 5,115. Oops, that's over. So maybe drop A04.\n\nNow, total effort would be 4,642, which is under 5138. Total importance would be 783+868+808+822+484+508+583= Let me add: 783+868=1651, +808=2459, +822=3281, +484=3765, +508=4273, +583=4856.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can include C17 instead of B41? C17 has effort 903 and importance 138. That's a low ratio, so probably not worth it.\n\nMaybe I should consider replacing lower importance items. For example, A04 is low importance, so it's better to drop it.\n\nAlternatively, could I include another high importance item? Let's see: If I remove B41 (effort 757, importance 583) and add something else. Let's see what else is left. A03 has high effort but low importance. A77 is low. Maybe C01 has 855 effort and 780 importance. But adding C01 instead of B41: B41 is 757 effort, C01 is 855. So, replacing B41 with C01 would increase effort by 98 but add 780-583=197 importance. Let me check total effort: 4,642 -757=3,885 +855=4,740, which is still under 5,138. So total effort 4,740, importance 4,856 -583 +780=5,053. That's better.\n\nSo now the set is B35, A71, A10, C00, B32, C54, C01.\n\nTotal effort: 524+850+730+746+419+616+855 = Let me add:\n\n524+850=1374, +730=2104, +746=2850, +419=3269, +616=3885, +855=4740. That's within the limit.\n\nImportance: 783+868+808+822+484+508+780 = Let's add step by step:\n\n783+868=1651, +808=2459, +822=3281, +484=3765, +508=4273, +780=5053. So total 5,053.\n\nIs there room for more? The remaining effort is 5138-4740=398.\n\nWhat items are left? Maybe B33 (763), but that's too big. B86 is 960, too big. A77 is 204, but importance 65. Maybe include A77? 204 effort, total becomes 4740+204=4944. Importance +65: 5053+65=5118. That's okay, but is there a better item? A77 is only 65, not great. Alternatively, C17 is 903, which won't fit. A03 is 946, too big. A04 is 473, which would bring effort to 4740+473=5213, which is over the limit. So the only possible addition is A77. So let's include it.\n\nNow total effort is 4944, importance 5118.\n\nCan we include A77? Let's see if it's worth. It's low importance, but it's the only one that fits. Alternatively, maybe we can swap out a lower importance item for it, but the others have higher importance, so it's better to include it.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of adding A77, could we swap out a lower importance item for a slightly higher one? For example, C54 has 508 importance, which is lower than some others. If I remove C54 (effort 616) and add A77 (204) + checking if there's another item with higher importance that can fit into the remaining effort.\n\nAfter removing C54, effort is 4740-616=4124. Then adding A77 (204) makes it 4328. Then remaining effort is 5138-4328=810.\n\nLooking for items with effort \u2264810 that can add importance. Let's see:\n\n- B33: 763 effort, 389 importance\n- B35 is already included\n- C00 included\n- A03: 946 too big\n- C17: 903 too big\n- A04:473, but importance 121\n- B32: included\n- B41:757\n- C01 included\n- So B33 with 763 is an option. Adding B33 would make effort 4328+763=5091, under 5138. Importance 389. So total importance would be 5053 -508 (since we removed C54) +389 = 5053-508=4545 +389=4934. That's less than before, so not better. So including C54 is better.\n\nSo perhaps it's best to stick with adding A77. So total set is B35, A71, A10, C00, B32, C54, C01, A77. Total effort 4944, total importance 5053+65=5118.\n\nIs there any better combination? Let me see. Maybe instead of adding A77, could I include a higher importance item.\n\nWait, let's see the effort if I add B33 instead. Without C54 and adding B41. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recast.\n\nAlternative approach: start with the highest importance. A71 has the highest importance, 868. Then A10 808, C00 822, B35 783, C01 780, B32 484, C54 508, B41 583, B33 389, B86 668, C17 138, A03 262, A04 121, A77 65.\n\nSo if I include A71 (850). Next, A10 (730), total effort 850+730=1580. Then C00 (746) makes it 2326. Then B35 (524) brings to 2850. Then C01 (855) makes 3705. Then B32 (419) to 4124. Then B41 (757) brings to 4881. Then I have 5138-4881=257 left. Any item under 257? A77 is 204, so include that. So total effort: 4881+204=5085, under limit. Importance:868+808+822+783+780+484+583+65= Let's add: 868+808=1676, +822=2498, +783=3281, +780=4061, +484=4545, +583=5128, +65=5193.\n\nWait, that's a high total importance. Let me check the items: A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B41, A77.\n\nEffort: 850+730+746+524+855+419+757+204 = Let me add:\n\n850+730=1580\n+746=2326\n+524=2850\n+855=3705\n+419=4124\n+757=4881\n+204=5085\n\nYes, within limit. Total importance is 5193, which is higher than the previous 5118.\n\nSo this seems better. So the items are A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B41, A77.\n\nBut wait, I included 8 items already, but some of them might have lower importance than others. Is there a way to include higher importance items? Let me see if any other combination can give higher importance without exceeding effort.\n\nAlternatively, could I swap B41 (effort 757, imp 583) with B86 (effort 960, imp 668). But 960 is too high, since 5085-757=4328 +960=5288, which exceeds 5138. So no.\n\nAlternatively, can I include B32 (419) and B33 (763) instead of B41 and B32? Let me see.\n\nIf I include B33 (763) instead of B41 (757), the effort would be 5085 -757 +763 =5091, which is still under. But B33 has lower importance (389 vs. 583), so total importance would decrease by 194, making it worse.\n\nSo including B41 is better.\n\nAnother thought: could I include B86 instead of, say, C00? Let's see. B86 effort 960 vs. C00 effort 746. The difference is 214. If I remove C00 and add B86: total effort 5085 -746 +960 = 5299, which is over. So no.\n\nAlternatively, could I remove a lower importance item and add a higher one. For example, remove A77 (65) and add something else. But the only items left are low importance ones.\n\nAlternatively, could I include C54 (508, 616) instead of A77. Let's see: 5085 -204 +616= 54897? No, that's wrong. Wait, 5085 - A77 (204) + C54 (616) = 5085 -204=4881 +616=5497, which is over 5138. So no.\n\nAlternatively, could I include C54 with some other swaps.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of including B32 (419) and A77 (204), I could include C54 (616). Let's see:\n\nCurrent total effort: 5085.\n\nIf I remove B32 (419) and A77 (204): total subtraction 623, so new effort 5085-623=4462. Then include C54 (616): 4462+616=5078, which is under. Importance would be 5193 -484 -65 +508 = 5193-549 +508=5152.\n\nThat's better by 41. So the new set is A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B41, C54.\n\nTotal effort:850+730+746+524+855+757+616= Let's add:\n\n850+730=1580\n+746=2326\n+524=2850\n+855=3705\n+757=4462\n+616=5078\n\nYes, within limit. Total importance:868+808+822+783+780+583+508= Let me add:\n\n868+808=1676\n+822=2498\n+783=3281\n+780=4061\n+583=4644\n+508=5152.\n\nThis is better than the previous 5193? No, wait, 5152 is less than 5193. So including B32 and A77 gave a higher total importance of 5193, while removing them and adding C54 gives 5152, which is worse. So better to stick with the previous set.\n\nWait, but C54 is 508 importance, which is higher than A77's 65, but lower than B32's 484. So swapping B32 and A77 for C54 reduces the total importance. So it's better to keep B32 and A77.\n\nWait, 484 (B32) +65 (A77) = 549 vs. 508 (C54). So 549 >508, so it's better to keep B32 and A77.\n\nTherefore, the initial set seems better: A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B41, B32, A77, with effort 5085 and importance 5193.\n\nIs there any other way to include higher importance items? Let's see, what's left: C17 (138), B33 (389), B86 (668), A03 (262), A04 (121).\n\nB86 has high importance 668, but effort 960. If I can include it without exceeding the limit. Let's see: total effort 5085. If I remove some items to make space.\n\nSuppose I remove B32 (419) and A77 (204), total subtraction 623, so effort becomes 5085 -623=4462. Then I can include B86 (960), which would put effort at 4462+960=5422, which is over 5138. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, remove more items. Maybe remove B41 (757), B32 (419), A77 (204). Total subtraction 757+419+204=1380. Then include B86 (960) and perhaps others. 5085 -1380=3705. Then add B86 (960), making it 3705+960=4665. Can I add more? Effort left:5138 -4665=473. Maybe C54 (616), but 616>473. So no. So total effort would be 4665, and importance would be 5193 -583(B41) -484(B32) -65(A77) +668(B86). So 5193 - (583+484+65)=5193-1132=4061 +668=4729. But 4729 is less than 5193, so worse.\n\nAnother idea: remove lower importance items to fit B86. Like remove A77 (204), A03 (946), but too much. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, try to include B86 by swapping out multiple lower importance items. For example, remove A77, A04, A03, etc., but it's getting too complicated.\n\nSo perhaps it's best to stick with the initial set of A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B41, A77, with total importance 5193 and effort 5085. But wait, the total effort is 5085, which is under 5138. There's still 5138-5085=53 left. Is there a small item that can fit? A04 has 473, which is too big. A77 is already included. A04 has 473, which would make effort 5085+473=5558, over. So nothing else can be added.\n\nIs there a way to include another high importance item by swapping?\n\nWait, I have B32 (484), B41 (583), and B35 (783). If I can swap B32 and B41 with higher importance items, but I think I've already included the highest ones.\n\nAlternatively, could I include B86 by removing lower priority items. Let me try:\n\nSuppose I remove B32 (419) and A77 (204): total subtraction 623, making effort 5085-623=4462. Then include B86 (960): 4462+960=5422, which is over. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove B41 (757) and A77 (204): 5085-757-204=5085-961=4124. Then include B86 (960): 4124+960=5084, which is under. Now, importance would be 5193 -583(B41) -65(A77) +668(B86) = 5193 -648 +668= 5193+20=5213. That's slightly better.\n\nWait, 5193 -583=4610, -65=4545, +668=5213.\n\nEffort: 4124+960=5084, under limit. So now the set is A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B86.\n\nWait, no, because B32 is still in. Let me clarify the set:\n\nAfter removing B41 and A77, and adding B86, the set includes B32. Yes. So the set is A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B86.\n\nEffort:850+730+746+524+855+419+960= let's calculate:\n\n850+730=1580\n+746=2326\n+524=2850\n+855=3705\n+419=4124\n+960=5084.\n\nYes, within limit. Importance:868+808+822+783+780+484+668= Let's add:\n\n868+808=1676\n+822=2498\n+783=3281\n+780=4061\n+484=4545\n+668=5213.\n\nThat's higher than the previous 5193. So this is better.\n\nIs this better? Yes, 5213 is higher. So this is a better set.\n\nWait, did I remove B41 and A77 and add B86, but what about B32? Oh no, because in the initial set, B32 was included, so after removal, B32 is still there.\n\nYes, so this seems better.\n\nIs there any better combination? Let me see.\n\nAnother thought: include B86 and B41.\n\nWait, B86 is 960, B41 is 757. Together, their effort is 1717. If I can include both, but with other items.\n\nBut the total effort would be too high. Let's check:\n\nA71 (850), A10 (730), C00 (746), B35 (524), C01 (855), B32 (419), B86 (960), B41 (757). Let's add efforts:\n\n850+730=1580\n+746=2326\n+524=2850\n+855=3705\n+419=4124\n+960=5084\n+757=58341? No, wait, 5084+757=5841, which is way over 5138. So can't include both.\n\nSo the best I can do is to include either B41 or B86, but not both.\n\nSo choosing B86 gives me higher importance. So better to include B86 instead of B41 and A77.\n\nSo the final set is A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B86.\n\nEffort:5084, importance:5213.\n\nCan I include anything else? The remaining effort is 5138-5084=54. No item has effort that small except maybe A77 (204), but I've already removed it. So nothing else can be added.\n\nThus, the best proposal is to include A71, A10, C00, B35, C01, B32, B86.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total importance again:\n\nA71:868, A10:808, C00:822, B35:783, C01:780, B32:484, B86:668.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n868+808=1676\n+822=2498\n+783=3281\n+780=4061\n+484=4545\n+668=5213. Yes.\n\nI think that's the highest I can get. So my proposal is this set.\n\nI should also consider if the other player might have different priorities and try to maximize my own without revealing my importance. I need to make a strong case for this set, highlighting the high importance and efficiency.\n\nSo my final step is to propose this set and explain why it's beneficial.\n",

                    "content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to maximize my total importance in this negotiation game. The goal is to propose a set of items that gives me the highest possible importance without exceeding the effort limit of 5138. Each item has both an effort and an importance value, but I don't know the other player's importance values, so I have to base my decisions solely on my own.\n\nFirst, I think I should prioritize the items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios. That makes sense because those items give me the most importance per unit of effort, which should help me maximize my total importance. Let me list out all the items with their importance and effort to calculate these ratios.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- C17: importance 138, effort 903 \u2192 ratio \u2248 0.1527\n- B41: 583 / 757 \u2248 0.7695\n- A71: 868 / 850 \u2248 1.021\n- C00: 822 / 746 \u2248 1.102\n- B35: 783 / 524 \u2248 1.493\n- A77: 65 / 204 \u2248 0.318\n- A03: 262 / 946 \u2248 0.276\n- A04: 121 / 473 \u2248 0.256\n- C54: 508 / 616 \u2248 0.826\n- C01: 780 / 855 \u2248 0.912\n- A87: 461 / 530 \u2248 0.869\n- B32: 484 / 419 \u2248 1.154\n- B86: 668 / 960 \u2248 0.695\n- B33: 389 / 763 \u2248 0.510\n- A10: 808 / 730 \u2248 1.106\n\nLooking at these ratios, the top ones are:\n\n1. B35: ~1.493\n2. A71: ~1.021\n3. C00: ~1.102\n4. A10: ~1.106\n5. B32: ~1.154\n6. C01: ~0.912\n7. B41: ~0.7695\n8. C54: ~0.826\n9. A87: ~0.869\n10. B86: ~0.695\n\nI'll start by selecting the highest ratio items first and see how much effort that uses, then keep adding the next highest until I can't add any more without exceeding the limit.\n\nStarting with B35 (effort 524). Total effort so far: 524.\n\nNext, A71 (effort 850). Total effort: 524 + 850 = 1374.\n\nNext, C00 (746). Total: 1374 + 746 = 2120.\n\nNext, A10 (730). Total: 2120 + 730 = 2850.\n\nNext, B32 (419). Total: 2850 + 419 = 3269.\n\nNext, C01 (855). Total: 3269 + 855 = 4124.\n\nNext, B41 (757). Total: 4124 + 757 = 4881.\n\nSo far, that's B35, A71, C00, A10, B32, C01, B41. Total effort is 4881, which leaves us with 5138 - 4881 = 257 effort left.\n\nLooking for the next highest ratio items within the remaining effort. The next in line is C54 with effort 616, which is too big. Then A87 with 530, also too big. B86 is 960, too big. So the only remaining items with effort under 257 are maybe A04 (473) which is too big, or A77 (204). 204 is within the limit.\n\nAdding A77: effort 204. Total effort becomes 4881 + 204 = 5085. That leaves us with 5138 - 5085 = 53, which isn't enough for any other item except maybe A04 (473) is way too big, or any other items.\n\nSo the set would be: B35, A71, C00, A10, B32, C01, B41, A77.\n\nLet me check the total effort again:\n\n524 + 850 = 1374\n\n1374 + 746 = 2120\n\n2120 + 730 = 2850\n\n2850 + 419 = 3269\n\n3269 + 855 = 4124\n\n4124 + 757 = 4881\n\n4881 + 204 = 5085\n\nThat's under the limit. Total importance for this set would be the sum of their importances:\n\n783 (B35) + 868 (A71) + 822 (C00) + 808 (A10) + 484 (B32) + 780 (C01) + 583 (B41) + 65 (A77) =\n\nLet's add these up:\n\n783 + 868 = 1651\n\n1651 + 822 = 2473\n\n2473 + 808 = 3281\n\n3281 + 484 = 3765\n\n3765 + 780 = 4545\n\n4545 + 583 = 5128\n\n5128 + 65 = 5193.\n\nThat's a total importance of 5193.\n\nIs this the maximum possible? Let's see if there's a way to replace some items to get a higher total importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swapping A77 (65 importance) with a higher importance item that fits within the remaining effort.\n\nWait, after adding up to B41, we had 4881 effort and 5128 importance. The remaining 257 effort could have been used for a higher importance item.\n\nLooking back, perhaps instead of adding A77, which only gives 65 importance, maybe using some other combination.\n\nLet me check if I can add a different item instead of A77 to get more importance. The remaining effort is 257. Are there any items with effort \u2264 257 that have higher importance than 65?\n\nLooking through the effort list:\n\nThe only items under 257 effort are:\n\nA77: 204, 65 importance\n\nA04: 473 (too big)\n\nA3: 946 (too big)\n\nSo, no, A77 is the only one with effort under 257, and it only adds 65 importance.\n\nSo maybe the initial selection is the best we can do in terms of maximizing importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we swap out some items with lower importance to make room for higher ones, but I don't think there's a higher importance item that can fit within the remaining effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we substitute an item with a slightly lower ratio but higher overall importance after considering the swap.\n\nFor example, if I remove A77 (65) and add... nothing, because nothing else fits. So, keeping A77 is better than nothing.\n\nTherefore, the proposal I made seems to be the best possible: {'B35', 'A71', 'C00', 'A10', 'B32', 'C01', 'B41', 'A77'}.\n\nBut in my previous attempt, I proposed a different set: {'A71', 'A10', 'C00', 'B35', 'C01', 'B32', 'B86'}, which had a total effort of:\n\nA71:850 + A10:730 = 1580\n\nC00:746 \u2192 2326\n\nB35:524 \u2192 2850\n\nC01:855 \u2192 3705\n\nB32:419 \u2192 4124\n\nB86:960 \u2192 5084.\n\nThat's within the limit. The total importance here would be:\n\nA71:868 + A10:808 = 1676\n\nC00:822 \u2192 2498\n\nB35:783 \u2192 3281\n\nC01:780 \u2192 4061\n\nB32:484 \u2192 4545\n\nB86:668 \u2192 5213.\n\nThis gives a total importance of 5213, which is slightly higher than the previous 5193.\n\nWait, but the effort is 5084, leaving 54 unused. Maybe I can add an item with effort \u226454? No, the smallest effort is 204, so no.\n\nTherefore, the second proposal gives a higher total importance than the first one.\n\nBut wait, in this proposal, I didn't include B41 (583), which was in the first one. Instead, I included B86 (668). So overall, the total importance is higher.\n\nSo it seems that the second proposal is better for me.\n\nTherefore, I should go with that set: {'A71', 'A10', 'C00', 'B35', 'C01', 'B32', 'B86'} with a total importance of 5213.\n\nBut let me double-check the effort:\n\nA71:850, A10:730 (1580)\n\nC00:746 (2326)\n\nB35:524 (2850)\n\nC01:855 (3705)\n\nB32:419 (4124)\n\nB86:960 (5084). Yep, that's correct.\n\nTotal effort:5084, which is under 5138. So that's better.\n\nAlternatively, could I add another small item? Effort left is 54, which isn't enough for any other item. So no.\n\nThus, I should make this my proposal because it gives me a higher total importance than the previous one.\n",
