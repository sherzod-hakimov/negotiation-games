    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation. I&#x27;m given a list of items with their effort values and my own importance scores. The goal is to agree on a set of items with the other player that maximizes my total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 7605. <br/><br/>First, I need to understand the problem. Each item has an effort required and an importance value specific to me. The other player has their own importance values, which I don&#x27;t know. We need to agree on a common set of items. My task is to strategize and propose a set that benefits me as much as possible.<br/><br/>I think the key here is to maximize the sum of my importance values while keeping the total effort under 7605. The challenge is that I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s priorities, so any proposal I make needs to be attractive enough that they would agree, but also maximize my own gain.<br/><br/>I should probably start by evaluating which items are most important to me and how much effort they require. Let me make a list sorted by the ratio of importance to effort because that would give me the items that give me the most bang for the buck.<br/><br/>So, first, I&#x27;ll calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item:<br/><br/>- B00: 583/951 ≈ 0.613<br/>- A08: 868/156 ≈ 5.564<br/>- B21: 138/369 ≈ 0.373<br/>- A27: 822/266 ≈ 3.091<br/>- B94: 783/581 ≈ 1.348<br/>- B53: 65/287 ≈ 0.226<br/>- A23: 262/866 ≈ 0.303<br/>- C65: 121/180 ≈ 0.672<br/>- A89: 508/800 ≈ 0.635<br/>- B67: 780/739 ≈ 1.055<br/>- B45: 461/637 ≈ 0.724<br/>- C34: 484/86 ≈ 5.628<br/>- C12: 668/749 ≈ 0.892<br/>- A05: 389/370 ≈ 1.051<br/>- B60: 808/345 ≈ 2.342<br/>- C92: 215/951 ≈ 0.226<br/>- B69: 97/147 ≈ 0.660<br/>- A84: 500/265 ≈ 1.887<br/>- C06: 30/262 ≈ 0.114<br/>- B12: 915/259 ≈ 3.534<br/>- A16: 856/358 ≈ 2.393<br/>- B85: 400/394 ≈ 1.015<br/>- C35: 444/286 ≈ 1.551<br/>- B10: 623/580 ≈ 1.074<br/>- C15: 781/479 ≈ 1.631<br/>- B09: 786/14 ≈ 56.143<br/>- B16: 3/153 ≈ 0.020<br/>- C81: 713/977 ≈ 0.729<br/>- A58: 457/134 ≈ 3.414<br/>- C24: 273/982 ≈ 0.278<br/>- A30: 739/259 ≈ 2.853<br/>- A66: 822/232 ≈ 3.543<br/>- B75: 235/202 ≈ 1.163<br/>- B46: 606/73 ≈ 8.301<br/>- C70: 968/821 ≈ 1.179<br/><br/>Looking at these ratios, the highest are:<br/><br/>1. B09: 56.143<br/>2. B46: 8.301<br/>3. A08: 5.564<br/>4. C34: 5.628<br/>5. B12: 3.534<br/>6. A27: 3.091<br/>7. A58: 3.414<br/>8. A66: 3.543<br/>9. B60: 2.342<br/>10. A16: 2.393<br/><br/>Wow, B09 has an extremely high ratio because its effort is very low (14) and importance is high (786). That seems like a must-have item because it&#x27;s so efficient. Similarly, B46 has a high ratio because its effort is very low (73) and importance is high (606). These two are probably crucial to include as they give a lot of importance with little effort.<br/><br/>Next, I notice that C34 has a high ratio too. It&#x27;s 484 importance for 86 effort, so that&#x27;s a good pick. A08 and A27 are also important, so including them would be beneficial.<br/><br/>I should prioritize including items with the highest ratios first, then see how much effort is used, and then fill in with other high-importance, lower ratio items if needed.<br/><br/>But wait, I can&#x27;t just pick all the high-ratio items because the total effort might exceed 7605. I need to select a combination that stays within the limit while maximizing my total importance.<br/><br/>So, let&#x27;s try to build a set step by step.<br/><br/>Start with B09 (effort 14, importance 786).<br/><br/>Next, B46 (effort 73, importance 606). Cumulative effort: 14+73=87. Importance: 786+606=1392.<br/><br/>Next, C34 (86). Effort total: 87+86=173. Importance: 1392+484=1876.<br/><br/>Then, A08 (156). Effort: 173+156=329. Importance: 1876+868=2744.<br/><br/>Next, B12 (259). Effort: 329+259=588. Importance: 2744+915=3659.<br/><br/>Then, A66 (232). Effort: 588+232=820. Importance: 3659+822=4481.<br/><br/>Next, A27 (266). Effort: 820+266=1086. Importance: 4481+822=5303.<br/><br/>Then, A58 (134). Effort: 1086+134=1220. Importance: 5303+457=5760.<br/><br/>Next, B60 (345). Effort: 1220+345=1565. Importance: 5760+808=6568.<br/><br/>Then, A16 (358). Effort: 1565+358=1923. Importance: 6568+856=7424.<br/><br/>At this point, adding another item like B85 (394) would bring effort to 1923+394=2317 and importance to 7424+400=7824.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should consider adding higher importance items instead of lower ones as I proceed.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should also consider items like B67, which has a moderate ratio but high importance. B67 has an effort of 739 and importance of 780, so ratio of ~1.055. But perhaps it&#x27;s better to include items with higher ratios.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s think about including B10 (623/580=1.074) or C15 (781/479=1.631). These have higher ratios. However, their effort is higher than some others.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can include multiple small-effort, high-importance items.<br/><br/>Let me try a different approach. Start with the highest ratio items and keep adding until I reach the limit.<br/><br/>B09 (14), B46 (73), C34 (86), A08 (156), B12 (259), A66 (232), A27 (266), A58 (134), B60 (345), A16 (358), B85 (394), B10 (580), C15 (479), and so on.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s calculate total effort:<br/><br/>14 (B09) +73=87, +86=173, +156=329, +259=588, +232=820, +266=1086, +134=1220, +345=1565, +358=1923, +394=2317, +580=2897, +479=3376.<br/><br/>Wait, but 3376 is under 7605, so perhaps I can include more items. But I might be missing other high importance items that could give me a better total.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the top 10 or 15 highest ratio items and then see if I can include more.<br/><br/>Let me list the items sorted by importance/effort ratio:<br/><br/>1. B09: 56.143<br/>2. B46: 8.301<br/>3. C34: 5.628<br/>4. B12: 3.534<br/>5. A66: 3.543<br/>6. A27: 3.091<br/>7. A58: 3.414<br/>8. A16: 2.393<br/>9. B60: 2.342<br/>10. C15: 1.631<br/>11. A84: 1.887<br/>12. C35: 1.551<br/>13. B10: 1.074<br/>14. C70: 1.179<br/>15. B67: 1.055<br/>16. B85: 1.015<br/>17. A05: 1.051<br/>18. A30: 2.853<br/>19. B00: 0.613<br/>20. C92: 0.226<br/>... and so on.<br/><br/>Wait, I think I missed some in my earlier list. So, A30 has a ratio of 2.853, which is high, so that&#x27;s important. Let me adjust the sorted list.<br/><br/>So, highest ratio items are:<br/><br/>1. B09<br/>2. B46<br/>3. C34<br/>4. A66 (3.543)<br/>5. B12 (3.534)<br/>6. A58 (3.414)<br/>7. A27 (3.091)<br/>8. A30 (2.853)<br/>9. A16 (2.393)<br/>10. B60 (2.342)<br/>11. A84 (1.887)<br/>12. C15 (1.631)<br/>13. C35 (1.551)<br/>14. B10 (1.074)<br/>15. C70 (1.179)<br/>16. B67 (1.055)<br/>17. A05 (1.051)<br/>18. B85 (1.015)<br/>19. B94 (1.348)<br/>... and so on.<br/><br/>Wait, I think I messed up the ordering. For example, A30 has 2.853, which is higher than A16&#x27;s 2.393.<br/><br/>So, after A27, which is 3.091, comes A30 at 2.853, then A16 at 2.393, B60 at 2.342.<br/><br/>So, let&#x27;s redo the sorted list:<br/><br/>1. B09<br/>2. B46<br/>3. C34<br/>4. A66<br/>5. B12<br/>6. A58<br/>7. A27<br/>8. A30<br/>9. A16<br/>10. B60<br/>11. A84<br/>12. C15<br/>13. C35<br/>14. B94<br/>15. B45<br/>16. C12<br/>17. A05<br/>18. B10<br/>19. C70<br/>20. B67<br/>... and so on.<br/><br/>Now, I&#x27;ll try to include as many high-ratio items as possible without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Let me try adding them step by step:<br/><br/>1. B09: 14, total effort=14, importance=786<br/>2. B46: +73=87, importance=606, total=786+606=1392<br/>3. C34: +86=173, importance=484, total=1876<br/>4. A66: +232=405, importance=822, total=2698<br/>5. B12: +259=664, importance=915, total=3613<br/>6. A58: +134=798, importance=457, total=4070<br/>7. A27: +266=1064, importance=822, total=4892<br/>8. A30: +259=1064+259=1323, importance=739, total=5631<br/>9. A16: +358=1681, importance=856, total=6487<br/>10. B60: +345=2026, importance=808, total=7295<br/>11. A84: +265=2291, importance=500, total=7795<br/>12. C15: +479=2770, importance=781, total=8576<br/><br/>Wait, but 2770 is way under the 7605 limit. So I can add more.<br/><br/>13. C35: +286=3056, importance=444, total=8576+444=9020<br/>But 9020 is still under 7605? No, wait, 3056 is the effort, which is under 7605. Wait, effort is 3056, which is way under.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I&#x27;m miscalculating. Let&#x27;s recalculate:<br/><br/>Wait, after step 11, total effort was 2291. Adding C15&#x27;s 479 makes it 2291+479=2770. So, still under 7605.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I include more items, the total effort could go up, but we have to stay under 7605. So, let&#x27;s continue.<br/><br/>14. C35: +286=2770+286=3056, importance=444, total=9020<br/>15. B10: +580=3056+580=3636, importance=623, total=9020+623=9643<br/>16. C70: +821=3636+821=4457, importance=968, total=9643+968=10611<br/>Wait, that&#x27;s way over the limit of 7605.<br/><br/>Wait, no, 4457 is still under 7605. But the total importance is getting too high, but I think I&#x27;m misunderstanding. The limit is 7605 for effort, not importance. So, I can include items as long as the total effort is ≤7605.<br/><br/>Wait, but I think I&#x27;m adding too many. Let me correct the steps.<br/><br/>Starting over:<br/><br/>1. B09: 14, total effort=14<br/>2. B46: +73=87<br/>3. C34: +86=173<br/>4. A66: +232=405<br/>5. B12: +259=664<br/>6. A58: +134=798<br/>7. A27: +266=1064<br/>8. A30: +259=1323<br/>9. A16: +358=1681<br/>10. B60: +345=2026<br/>11. A84: +265=2291<br/>12. C15: +479=2770<br/>13. C35: +286=3056<br/>14. B10: +580=3636<br/>15. C70: +821=4457<br/>16. B94: +581=5038<br/>17. B67: +739=5777<br/>18. B45: +637=6414<br/>19. C12: +749=7163<br/>20. A23: +866=8030, which is over 7605.<br/><br/>Wait, so up to step 19, effort is 7163, which is under 7605. Let&#x27;s see how much importance we have so far:<br/><br/>Total importance would be sum of all the individual importances. Let me list each step&#x27;s importance:<br/><br/>1. 786<br/>2. +606=1392<br/>3. +484=1876<br/>4. +822=2698<br/>5. +915=3613<br/>6. +457=4070<br/>7. +822=4892<br/>8. +739=5631<br/>9. +856=6487<br/>10. +808=7295<br/>11. +500=7795<br/>12. +781=8576<br/>13. +444=9020<br/>14. +623=9643<br/>15. +968=10611<br/>16. +783=11394<br/>17. +780=12174<br/>18. +461=12635<br/>19. +668=13303<br/><br/>So, at step 19, total effort is 7163, which is under 7605, and total importance is 13303. Then, perhaps I can add more items.<br/><br/>Next high ratio items after C12 would be A05 (importance 389, effort 370). Adding that would bring effort to 7163+370=7533, which is still under 7605. Importance would be 13303+389=13692.<br/><br/>Next, B94 has effort 581, but adding that would exceed the limit (7533+581=8114&gt;7605), so we can&#x27;t include it. So the next option is perhaps lower effort, high importance items that fit.<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort ≤ (7605-7533)=72.<br/><br/>Looking through the remaining items, what has effort ≤72?<br/><br/>From the effort list:<br/><br/>B46:73 (already included)<br/>B09:14 (included)<br/>A58:134 (included)<br/>B16:153, C34:86 (included), C34 is already included. A08:156 (included). Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Wait, B46 is 73, which we have, B09 is 14, B69 is 147, which is &gt;72, B12:259, included. Hmm, perhaps C34 is already included.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps items not yet included with effort ≤72 could be B16:153 is too high, B46 is 73, which is just over. Wait, perhaps I can swap out some lower importance items with smaller effort but higher importance per effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to include A05 as above, and then see if any small effort items are left.<br/><br/>But in this case, after including A05, the effort is 7533, leaving 72 remaining. Are there any items not included with effort ≤72 that have high importance?<br/><br/>Looking back, the items not yet included with effort ≤72:<br/><br/>B46 is 73, which is over. So perhaps none. So, perhaps A05 is the last addition.<br/><br/>So total effort would be 7533, total importance 13692.<br/><br/>Wait, but perhaps I can find a better combination by swapping some items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe including B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, B67, C15, etc. But I think the current set is already quite optimized.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A27, A58, B60, A84, C15, C35, B10, C70, C12, and A05.<br/><br/>But let me check the effort:<br/><br/>14 (B09) +73 (B46) +86 (C34) = 173<br/>+156 (A08) = 329<br/>+259 (B12)=588<br/>+232 (A66)=820<br/>+266 (A27)=1086<br/>+134 (A58)=1220<br/>+345 (B60)=1565<br/>+265 (A84)=1830<br/>+479 (C15)=2309<br/>+286 (C35)=2595<br/>+580 (B10)=3175<br/>+821 (C70)=3996<br/>+749 (C12)=4745<br/>+370 (A05)=5115<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 5115 effort, which is way under 7605. So we could include more items.<br/><br/>But perhaps adding higher-effort, high-importance items.<br/><br/>Wait, but the effort is 5115, leaving 7605-5115=2490 remaining.<br/><br/>So we could add items with effort up to 2490, but we need to pick those with the highest importance per effort.<br/><br/>Looking for items not yet included with highest importance/effort ratios:<br/><br/>A89:508/800=0.635, effort 800. So 800 is manageable.<br/><br/>Adding A89: effort=800, importance=508. Total effort=5115+800=5915. Importance=13692+508=14200.<br/><br/>Next, B00:583/951=0.613, effort=951. Adding it would bring effort to 5915+951=6866, which is under 7605. Importance=14200+583=14783.<br/><br/>Then, B94:783/581=1.348, effort=581. Adding it would bring effort to 6866+581=7447. Importance=14783+783=15566.<br/><br/>Then, B85:400/394=1.015, effort=394. Adding it brings effort to 7447+394=7841, which is over 7605. So can&#x27;t add B85.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps adding B45:461/637=0.724, effort=637. 7447+637=8084&gt;7605, so can&#x27;t add.<br/><br/>Alternatively, C92:215/951=0.226, effort=951, which is over. So not useful.<br/><br/>Alternatively, B67:780/739=1.055, effort=739. 7447+739=8186&gt;7605, can&#x27;t add.<br/><br/>Alternatively, B10 is already included. So perhaps B94 is the last item to add, bringing effort to 7447, which is under 7605.<br/><br/>Thus, total effort=7447, total importance=15566.<br/><br/>So, the items included are:<br/><br/>B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A27, A58, B60, A84, C15, C35, B10, C70, C12, A05, A89, B00, B94.<br/><br/>Let me check the effort sum:<br/><br/>14 +73=87<br/>+86=173<br/>+156=329<br/>+259=588<br/>+232=820<br/>+266=1086<br/>+134=1220<br/>+345=1565<br/>+265=1830<br/>+479=2309<br/>+286=2595<br/>+580=3175<br/>+821=3996<br/>+749=4745<br/>+370=5115<br/>+800=5915<br/>+951=6866<br/>+581=7447.<br/><br/>Total=7447, which is under 7605.<br/><br/>Total importance is 15566.<br/><br/>But is this the maximum possible? Maybe not. Perhaps there are other combinations that could include more high-importance items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including A89 earlier might allow including more items. Or perhaps substituting lower importance items with higher ones within the effort limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including B09 and B46 is a must because of their high ratios, and then focusing on other high-importance, high-ratio items.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps including B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A27, A58, B60, A84, C15, C35, B10, C70, C12, A05, A89, B00, B94, and within the remaining effort, maybe include more items.<br/><br/>Wait, but after B94, the effort is 7447, leaving 7605-7447=158.<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort ≤158 and high importance. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>From the remaining items, the ones not included yet:<br/><br/>A23:866, which is too high.<br/>A05:370 (already included)<br/>B75:202, effort=202 ≤158? No, 202&gt;158.<br/>B16:153, effort=153, which is ≤158. Its importance is 3, so not useful.<br/>B69:147, effort=147 ≤158. Importance=97.<br/>B53:287, which is &gt;158.<br/>B09:14, included.<br/>B16:153, effort=153, importance=3.<br/>B69:147, importance=97.<br/>C06:30, importance=30.<br/>B16:3, which is low.<br/>B46:73, included.<br/><br/>So, the only items with effort ≤158 that are not included and have decent importance are B69 (97) with effort 147, and C06 (30) with 262, but that&#x27;s too high. So, B69: effort=147, importance=97.<br/><br/>Adding B69 would bring effort to 7447+147=7594, which is under 7605. So total effort=7594, and importance=15566+97=15663.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s better. So, include B69 as well.<br/><br/>Thus, the final set would be:<br/><br/>B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A27, A58, B60, A84, C15, C35, B10, C70, C12, A05, A89, B00, B94, B69.<br/><br/>Let me verify each addition:<br/><br/>1. Start with B09 (14)<br/>2. +B46 (73) =87<br/>3. +C34 (86)=173<br/>4. +A08 (156)=329<br/>5. +B12 (259)=588<br/>6. +A66 (232)=820<br/>7. +A27 (266)=1086<br/>8. +A58 (134)=1220<br/>9. +B60 (345)=1565<br/>10. +A84 (265)=1830<br/>11. +C15 (479)=2309<br/>12. +C35 (286)=2595<br/>13. +B10 (580)=3175<br/>14. +C70 (821)=3996<br/>15. +C12 (749)=4745<br/>16. +A05 (370)=5115<br/>17. +A89 (800)=5915<br/>18. +B00 (951)=6866<br/>19. +B94 (581)=7447<br/>20. +B69 (147)=7594<br/><br/>Total effort=7594, under 7605. Total importance=15566+97=15663.<br/><br/>I think this is a solid set because it includes the highest ratio items and uses almost all the available effort limit. The total importance is 15663, which is quite high.<br/><br/>However, perhaps there&#x27;s a way to tweak this to include even more high-importance items. For example, swapping out some lower importance items for higher ones that fit within the effort limit. But given the time constraints, I think this is a good starting proposal.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll propose this set, and see how the other player reacts. If they refuse, I can try to adjust by adding or removing items that might be more appealing to them without sacrificing too much of my own importance.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I need to collaborate with another participant to select a set of items. The goal is to maximize my own total importance while staying under the effort limit of 7605. I don&#x27;t know how the other person values these items, but I know their effort values and my own importance values.<br/><br/>First, I should assess the situation. The other participant made a PROPOSAL, which I need to respond to. My job is to evaluate whether their proposal is acceptable or if I need to refuse it. If I refuse, I should think about why and how to argue against it, maybe pointing out that their proposal might not be optimal for me or maybe exceeds the effort limit.<br/><br/>So, let me start by analyzing their proposal. Their proposed set is {&#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;C34&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;A58&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;A84&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;C35&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C12&#x27;, &#x27;A05&#x27;, &#x27;A89&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;}. I need to check the total effort and total importance of this set.<br/><br/>Calculating the total effort: I&#x27;ll add up each item&#x27;s effort value from the given data.<br/><br/>- B09: 14<br/>- B46: 73<br/>- C34: 86<br/>- A08: 156<br/>- B12: 259<br/>- A66: 232<br/>- A27: 266<br/>- A58: 134<br/>- B60: 345<br/>- A84: 265<br/>- C15: 479<br/>- C35: 286<br/>- B10: 580<br/>- C70: 821<br/>- C12: 749<br/>- A05: 370<br/>- A89: 800<br/>- B00: 951<br/>- B94: 581<br/>- B69: 147<br/><br/>Let me add these up step by step:<br/><br/>14 + 73 = 87<br/><br/>87 + 86 = 173<br/><br/>173 + 156 = 329<br/><br/>329 + 259 = 588<br/><br/>588 + 232 = 820<br/><br/>820 + 266 = 1086<br/><br/>1086 + 134 = 1220<br/><br/>1220 + 345 = 1565<br/><br/>1565 + 265 = 1830<br/><br/>1830 + 479 = 2309<br/><br/>2309 + 286 = 2595<br/><br/>2595 + 580 = 3175<br/><br/>3175 + 821 = 3996<br/><br/>3996 + 749 = 4745<br/><br/>4745 + 370 = 5115<br/><br/>5115 + 800 = 5915<br/><br/>5915 + 951 = 6866<br/><br/>6866 + 581 = 7447<br/><br/>7447 + 147 = 7594<br/><br/>Total effort is 7594, which is under the limit of 7605, so that&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Now, calculating the total importance for me:<br/><br/>- B09: 786<br/>- B46: 606<br/>- C34: 484<br/>- A08: 868<br/>- B12: 915<br/>- A66: 822<br/>- A27: 822<br/>- A58: 457<br/>- B60: 808<br/>- A84: 500<br/>- C15: 781<br/>- C35: 444<br/>- B10: 623<br/>- C70: 968<br/>- C12: 668<br/>- A05: 389<br/>- A89: 508<br/>- B00: 583<br/>- B94: 783<br/>- B69: 97<br/><br/>Adding these up:<br/><br/>786 + 606 = 1392<br/><br/>1392 + 484 = 1876<br/><br/>1876 + 868 = 2744<br/><br/>2744 + 915 = 3659<br/><br/>3659 + 822 = 4481<br/><br/>4481 + 822 = 5303<br/><br/>5303 + 457 = 5760<br/><br/>5760 + 808 = 6568<br/><br/>6568 + 500 = 7068<br/><br/>7068 + 781 = 7849<br/><br/>7849 + 444 = 8293<br/><br/>8293 + 623 = 8916<br/><br/>8916 + 968 = 9884<br/><br/>9884 + 668 = 10552<br/><br/>10552 + 389 = 10941<br/><br/>10941 + 508 = 11449<br/><br/>11449 + 583 = 12032<br/><br/>12032 + 783 = 12815<br/><br/>12815 + 97 = 12912<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a total importance of 12,912 for me. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high number. But I need to consider whether I can get a better deal by refusing this proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can do better. Maybe by adding or swapping some items to increase my total importance further without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Let me check if there are items in the proposal that have lower importance to me but high effort, which I could potentially swap out for other items that have higher importance and not too much effort.<br/><br/>Looking at the items in the proposal, B09 has high importance (786) but low effort (14), so that&#x27;s a good one. B46 has 606 importance and 73 effort—also good. C34 is 484 importance, 86 effort. That&#x27;s a decent ratio but maybe could be better.<br/><br/>Looking at the items not in the proposal: maybe there are items with higher importance to me that aren&#x27;t included. Let&#x27;s see: A23 has 262 importance, 866 effort. That&#x27;s low importance. A05 is included. A30 is not in the proposal, has 259 importance, 259 effort—not too great. B53: 65, 287. A16: 856, but with effort 358. That&#x27;s a high importance, maybe worth considering.<br/><br/>Wait, A16 has effort 358 and importance 856. That&#x27;s an importance of 856, which is higher than some items in the current proposal. Let me check if swapping some lower importance items with A16 would help.<br/><br/>For example, in the current proposal, A58 is included, which has 457 importance for me and effort 134. If I remove A58 (effort 134) and add A16 (effort 358), the total effort would go up by 358 - 134 = 224. Since the current total effort is 7594, adding 224 would make it 7818, which is still under 7605? Wait, 7594 + 224 = 7818, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can remove a higher effort item. Let&#x27;s see, maybe C70 has high effort (821) and importance 968. But that&#x27;s a high importance, so maybe better to keep. Alternatively, perhaps remove C15: 781 importance, effort 479. If I remove C15 (effort 479) and add A16 (effort 358), that would decrease effort by 121, allowing me to maybe add more items.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the proposal, the effort is 7594. Removing C15 (479) and adding A16 (358) would save 121, so total effort becomes 7594 - 479 + 358 = 7594 - 121 = 7473. Then, with the saved 121, perhaps I can add another item. Let&#x27;s see, what&#x27;s the next high importance item not included.<br/><br/>Looking at items not included: A16, B53, C06, B16, C92, etc. A16 is high importance. Maybe adding A16 and removing something else.<br/><br/>But perhaps I can think of other combinations. Alternatively, maybe the current proposal is already pretty good for me, giving me 12,912 importance. I wonder if the other player would accept a slight modification, but I don&#x27;t know their importance values. Maybe it&#x27;s better to accept if I can&#x27;t find a better combination quickly.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can refuse the proposal and make a counter-proposal that includes A16 instead of some lower importance items. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better for me.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s see: if I remove A58 (457 importance, 134 effort) and add A16 (856 importance, 358 effort), the net change in importance is +399, and the net change in effort is +224. Since the current total effort is 7594, adding 224 would make it 7818, which is over the limit. So I can&#x27;t do that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can remove multiple items to make space. Suppose I remove A58 and C34, which have total effort 134 + 86 = 220, and add A16 (358), that would require 358, so 220 - 358 = -138. Then I have 220 - 358 = -138, meaning I could add other items. Wait, no, the effort would decrease by 138, allowing me to add more items.<br/><br/>Wait, I&#x27;m getting confused. Let me recalculate.<br/><br/>Current effort: 7594.<br/><br/>If I remove A58 (134) and C34 (86), that&#x27;s 220 effort removed.<br/><br/>Then I can add A16 (358). So total effort becomes 7594 - 220 + 358 = 7594 - 220 is 7374 + 358 is 7732, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove more items. Suppose I remove A58, C34, and A05 (370). That&#x27;s 134 + 86 + 370 = 590 effort. Then I can add A16 (358). So effort becomes 7594 - 590 + 358 = 7594 - 232 = 7362, which is under the limit. But that would remove 457 (A58) + 484 (C34) + 389 (A05) = 1330 importance, and add 856 (A16), so net loss of 1330 - 856 = 474. That&#x27;s worse for me, so not worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps remove lower importance items to make space for higher ones. Let me look for items in the proposal with lower importance.<br/><br/>Looking at the proposal items:<br/><br/>- B69: 97 importance, effort 147. That&#x27;s a low importance, high effort. Maybe I can remove this.<br/><br/>If I remove B69 (147 effort), that would free up 147. Then, I could add an item with higher importance and effort &lt;=147. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>A16 has effort 358, which is too high. B53: 65 importance, 287 effort. Not great. C92: 215 importance, 951 effort—too high. B10: 580 effort—too high. Hmm. Maybe there&#x27;s no high importance item with effort under 147. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to keep B69.<br/><br/>Alternatively, B12 is in the proposal with 915 importance and 259 effort. That&#x27;s a high importance. Maybe I can see if I can swap that with something else, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.<br/><br/>Given the time I&#x27;ve spent and the fact that the proposal is already yielding a high importance for me, maybe it&#x27;s best to accept it. Alternatively, I could try to negotiate further, but I don&#x27;t want to risk losing this good deal.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I should AGREE to this proposal. But wait, maybe I can argue that the proposal is good but suggest a small tweak if possible. Although, I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s priorities.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could refuse the proposal, stating that while it&#x27;s good, I think we can include more high-importance items. But without knowing the other player&#x27;s preferences, it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Given that the effort is 7594, just under the limit, and the importance is 12,912 for me, which seems quite high, I think it&#x27;s a strong proposal. So I&#x27;ll AGREE to it.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: After carefully evaluating the proposed set and calculating both the total effort and my total importance, I realized that the proposed set is efficient and maximizing my benefit significantly. Although I considered potential swaps, the high importance and manageable effort of the current set make it an optimal choice. Therefore, I choose to accept the proposal.<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;C34&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;A58&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;A84&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;C35&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C12&#x27;, &#x27;A05&#x27;, &#x27;A89&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;}</p>

        <p>Alright, I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the user&#x27;s correction. The user pointed out that my previous messages didn&#x27;t start with the proper STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. They emphasized that the very first structured format must be of the correct form. I need to make sure that my response strictly follows the given protocol.<br/><br/>Looking back, I realize that in the initial interaction, I included the STRATEGIC REASONING tag, but perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the very first thing or was incorrectly formatted. The user&#x27;s correction indicates that my subsequent messages didn&#x27;t adhere to this rule, so I need to correct that.<br/><br/>I should start the next message with STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by a structured proposal that&#x27;s within the effort limit. I also need to ensure that I include an ARGUMENT tag to defend my proposal or explain my reasoning. Remember, the goal is to maximize my own importance without revealing my scores, so I&#x27;ll prioritize high-importance, low-effort items.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll recalculate the total effort and ensure it doesn&#x27;t exceed 7605. Then, I&#x27;ll structure my message correctly, starting with the strategic reasoning, followed by the proposal and an argument justifying it.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set of items effectively maximizes my personal importance while adhering to the effort limit. By selecting items with high importance-to-effort ratios, I ensure that each item contributes significantly to my total without overextending the effort capacity. This strategic approach allows me to secure a favorable outcome without compromising on the total effort constraint.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;C34&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;A58&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;A84&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;C35&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C12&#x27;, &#x27;A05&#x27;, &#x27;A89&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: This proposal optimally balances effort and importance, ensuring maximum benefit for me while staying within the effort limit.</p>
