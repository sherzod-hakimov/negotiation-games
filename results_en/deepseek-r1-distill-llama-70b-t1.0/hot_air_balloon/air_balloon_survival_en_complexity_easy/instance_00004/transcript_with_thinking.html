        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 9612<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;B21&quot;: 935, &quot;B00&quot;: 928, &quot;A08&quot;: 725, &quot;A27&quot;: 218, &quot;B94&quot;: 839, &quot;B53&quot;: 970, &quot;A23&quot;: 394, &quot;C65&quot;: 677, &quot;A89&quot;: 946, &quot;B67&quot;: 530, &quot;B45&quot;: 138, &quot;C34&quot;: 834, &quot;C12&quot;: 734, &quot;A05&quot;: 593, &quot;B60&quot;: 261, &quot;C92&quot;: 743, &quot;B69&quot;: 4, &quot;A84&quot;: 735, &quot;C06&quot;: 124, &quot;B12&quot;: 829, &quot;A16&quot;: 207, &quot;B85&quot;: 782, &quot;C35&quot;: 577, &quot;B10&quot;: 388, &quot;C15&quot;: 679, &quot;B09&quot;: 494, &quot;B16&quot;: 559, &quot;C81&quot;: 629, &quot;A58&quot;: 237, &quot;C24&quot;: 275, &quot;A30&quot;: 39, &quot;A66&quot;: 654, &quot;B75&quot;: 172, &quot;B46&quot;: 688, &quot;C70&quot;: 687}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;B21&quot;: 138, &quot;B00&quot;: 583, &quot;A08&quot;: 868, &quot;A27&quot;: 822, &quot;B94&quot;: 783, &quot;B53&quot;: 65, &quot;A23&quot;: 262, &quot;C65&quot;: 121, &quot;A89&quot;: 508, &quot;B67&quot;: 780, &quot;B45&quot;: 461, &quot;C34&quot;: 484, &quot;C12&quot;: 668, &quot;A05&quot;: 389, &quot;B60&quot;: 808, &quot;C92&quot;: 215, &quot;B69&quot;: 97, &quot;A84&quot;: 500, &quot;C06&quot;: 30, &quot;B12&quot;: 915, &quot;A16&quot;: 856, &quot;B85&quot;: 400, &quot;C35&quot;: 444, &quot;B10&quot;: 623, &quot;C15&quot;: 781, &quot;B09&quot;: 786, &quot;B16&quot;: 3, &quot;C81&quot;: 713, &quot;A58&quot;: 457, &quot;C24&quot;: 273, &quot;A30&quot;: 739, &quot;A66&quot;: 822, &quot;B75&quot;: 235, &quot;B46&quot;: 606, &quot;C70&quot;: 968}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

All tactics are allowed!<br/><br/>Interaction Protocol:<br/><br/>You may only use the following structured formats in a message:<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Propose keeping exactly those items.<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Explicitly reject opponent&#x27;s proposal.<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;...&#x27;}<br/>Defend your last proposal or argue against the player&#x27;s proposal.<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, …}<br/>Accept the opponent&#x27;s proposal which ends the game.<br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;...&#x27;}<br/>	Describe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>You may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>You may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>Total effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.<br/>Do NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.<br/>A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Alright, let&#x27;s break this down step by step. First, I need to understand the negotiation scenario I&#x27;m in. I have to work with another participant to agree on a set of items that maximizes my total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 9612. Both of us have different importance values for each item, and we don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s preferences. My goal is to get the best possible deal for myself.<br/><br/>Looking at the item efforts, I see that each item has a specific effort value. My personal importance for each is also given, so I need to find a balance between the items that are most important to me and the effort they require.<br/><br/>Let me list out all the items with their effort and my importance to get a clearer picture:<br/><br/>- B21: Effort 935, Importance 138<br/>- B00: Effort 928, Importance 583<br/>- A08: Effort 725, Importance 868<br/>- A27: Effort 218, Importance 822<br/>- B94: Effort 839, Importance 783<br/>- B53: Effort 970, Importance 65<br/>- A23: Effort 394, Importance 262<br/>- C65: Effort 677, Importance 121<br/>- A89: Effort 946, Importance 508<br/>- B67: Effort 530, Importance 780<br/>- B45: Effort 138, Importance 461<br/>- C34: Effort 834, Importance 484<br/>- C12: Effort 734, Importance 668<br/>- A05: Effort 593, Importance 389<br/>- B60: Effort 261, Importance 808<br/>- C92: Effort 743, Importance 215<br/>- B69: Effort 4, Importance 97<br/>- A84: Effort 735, Importance 500<br/>- C06: Effort 124, Importance 30<br/>- B12: Effort 829, Importance 915<br/>- A16: Effort 207, Importance 856<br/>- B85: Effort 782, Importance 400<br/>- C35: Effort 577, Importance 444<br/>- B10: Effort 388, Importance 623<br/>- C15: Effort 679, Importance 781<br/>- B09: Effort 494, Importance 786<br/>- B16: Effort 559, Importance 3<br/>- C81: Effort 629, Importance 713<br/>- A58: Effort 237, Importance 457<br/>- C24: Effort 275, Importance 273<br/>- A30: Effort 39, Importance 739<br/>- A66: Effort 654, Importance 822<br/>- B75: Effort 172, Importance 235<br/>- B46: Effort 688, Importance 606<br/>- C70: Effort 687, Importance 968<br/><br/>Now, I need to prioritize items that give me the highest importance per effort. This will help me maximize my total importance without exceeding the limit. Calculating the importance per effort ratio for each item:<br/><br/>- A30: 739 / 39 ≈ 18.9487<br/>- B69: 97 / 4 = 24.25<br/>- C06: 30 / 124 ≈ 0.2419<br/>- B45: 461 / 138 ≈ 3.340<br/>- A27: 822 / 218 ≈ 3.770<br/>- B75: 235 / 172 ≈ 1.367<br/>- A16: 856 / 207 ≈ 4.139<br/>- A58: 457 / 237 ≈ 1.928<br/>- C24: 273 / 275 ≈ 0.9918<br/>- B60: 808 / 261 ≈ 3.097<br/>- A05: 389 / 593 ≈ 0.656<br/>- A23: 262 / 394 ≈ 0.665<br/>- B10: 623 / 388 ≈ 1.606<br/>- C35: 444 / 577 ≈ 0.769<br/>- B12: 915 / 829 ≈ 1.104<br/>- B46: 606 / 688 ≈ 0.881<br/>- C70: 968 / 687 ≈ 1.407<br/>- A08: 868 / 725 ≈ 1.197<br/>- C12: 668 / 734 ≈ 0.909<br/>- C15: 781 / 679 ≈ 1.150<br/>- B67: 780 / 530 ≈ 1.472<br/>- A84: 500 / 735 ≈ 0.680<br/>- B00: 583 / 928 ≈ 0.628<br/>- B09: 786 / 494 ≈ 1.591<br/>- C81: 713 / 629 ≈ 1.133<br/>- B85: 400 / 782 ≈ 0.512<br/>- C92: 215 / 743 ≈ 0.289<br/>- C34: 484 / 834 ≈ 0.580<br/>- B94: 783 / 839 ≈ 0.933<br/>- A89: 508 / 946 ≈ 0.537<br/>- B21: 138 / 935 ≈ 0.147<br/>- B53: 65 / 970 ≈ 0.067<br/>- C65: 121 / 677 ≈ 0.179<br/>- B16: 3 / 559 ≈ 0.005<br/>- A66: 822 / 654 ≈ 1.257<br/>- B70 isn&#x27;t listed here, I think I miscalculated earlier—no, I don&#x27;t have that item.<br/><br/>Wait, I see that in the effort list, some items might have higher importance for me. Let me correct that:<br/><br/>A30 seems great, as it has a very high importance per effort. Then B69 is also excellent with the highest ratio. A16 and A27 are also good. I need to consider including these high-ratio items first.<br/><br/>Let me start by considering the top items based on their ratio:<br/><br/>1. B69: 4 / 97 is actually wrong. Wait, B69 has effort 4 and importance 97. So ratio is 97/4 = 24.25.<br/>2. A30: 39 effort, 739 importance: ~18.9487.<br/><br/>So B69 is actually the highest. Then A30. Then maybe A27, A16.<br/><br/>But wait, B69 only gives 97 importance but with very low effort, which is good, but the total importance isn&#x27;t that high. Maybe including it is beneficial because it frees up effort for more important items.<br/><br/>Similarly, A30 is high importance at low effort. These items are great picks.<br/><br/>Let me consider building a set that includes these high-importance, low-effort items.<br/><br/>First, let&#x27;s consider A30: effort 39, importance 739.<br/><br/>If I take A30, I have 9612 - 39 = 9573 left.<br/><br/>Next, B69: effort 4, total used 43, remaining 9569. Importance now 739 + 97 = 836.<br/><br/>Then, let&#x27;s look for other high-ratio items. A16: effort 207, importance 856. So adding that, total effort 207 + 43 = 250. Remaining 9362. Importance 836 + 856 = 1692.<br/><br/>A27: effort 218, importance 822. Adding that, total effort 218 + 250 = 468. Remaining 9144. Importance 1692 + 822 = 2514.<br/><br/>Next, B60: 261 effort, 808 importance. Adding that, total effort 261 + 468 = 729. Remaining 8883. Importance 2514 + 808 = 3322.<br/><br/>B45: effort 138, importance 461. Adding that, total effort 138 + 729 = 867. Remaining 8745. Importance 3322 + 461 = 3783.<br/><br/>A08: 725 effort, 868 importance. Adding that, total effort 725 + 867 = 1592. Remaining 8020. Importance 3783 + 868 = 4651.<br/><br/>C15: 679 effort, 781 importance. Adding that, total effort 679 + 1592 = 2271. Remaining 7341. Importance 4651 + 781 = 5432.<br/><br/>B09: 494 effort, 786 importance. Adding that, total effort 494 + 2271 = 2765. Remaining 6847. Importance 5432 + 786 = 6218.<br/><br/>B67: 530 effort, 780 importance. Adding that, total effort 530 + 2765 = 3295. Remaining 6317. Importance 6218 + 780 = 6998.<br/><br/>A66: 654 effort, 822 importance. Adding that, total effort 654 + 3295 = 3949. Remaining 5663. Importance 6998 + 822 = 7820.<br/><br/>Wait, this is getting me high importance, but I still have 5k+ effort left. Let me see if I can include more.<br/><br/>B12: 829 effort, 915 importance. Adding that, total effort 829 + 3949 = 4778. Remaining 4834. Importance 7820 + 915 = 8735.<br/><br/>C81: 629 effort, 713 importance. But 629 &gt; 4834? No, 629 is less than 4834. Adding that: 629 + 4778 = 5407. Remaining 4205. Importance 8735 + 713 = 9448.<br/><br/>Now, what&#x27;s next? Let me check other high-ratio items. C06 is very low, so no. B16 is also low.<br/><br/>B10: 388 effort, 623 importance. Adding that: 388 + 5407 = 5795. Remaining 3817. Importance 9448 + 623 = 10071.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s over 9612? No, 5795 effort, so 9612 - 5795 = 3817 left. No, not over. Importance is 10071, which is fine.<br/><br/>What&#x27;s the total now: 5795 effort, which is within limit.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can add more. Let&#x27;s check remaining effort: 3817.<br/><br/>Looking for next high-value items. Maybe B94: 839, 783 importance. 839 is within 3817. Adding it, effort becomes 5795 + 839 = 6634. Remaining 2978. Importance 10071 + 783 = 10854.<br/><br/>Is there anything else? Let&#x27;s see. B85: 782, 400. Adding that would take effort to 6634 + 782 = 7416. Remaining 2196. Importance 10854 + 400 = 11254.<br/><br/>C34: 834, but 834 is larger than 2196, so can&#x27;t add. Next, B46: 688, 606 importance. 688 &lt; 2196. Adding that: effort 7416 + 688 = 8104. Remaining 1508. Importance 11254 + 606 = 11860.<br/><br/>Still, 1508 left. Next, C70: 687, 968. But 687 &gt; 1508? No, 687 is less. Adding that: effort 8104 + 687 = 8791. Remaining 821. Importance 11860 + 968 = 12828.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 821. Can I add anything else? Let me check. C24: 275, 273. So adding that: 275 + 8791 = 9066. Remaining 546. Importance 12828 + 273 = 13101.<br/><br/>B75: 172, 235. Adding that: 172 + 9066 = 9238. Remaining 374. Importance 13101 + 235 = 13336.<br/><br/>C35: 577, but effort left is 374, can&#x27;t add. B09 is already included. Maybe C06: 124, 30. Adding that: 124 + 9238 = 9362. Remaining 250. Importance 13336 + 30=13366.<br/><br/>Any remaining? 250. Let me see if any small items can fit. B45:138, already included. A05:593, too big. B60 is included. B16: 3, already included. Wait, no, B16 is low importance. So maybe not.<br/><br/>Wait, let me tally up the total effort to ensure it&#x27;s under 9612.<br/><br/>Wait, initial additions: A30 (39), B69 (4), A16 (207), A27 (218), B60 (261), B45 (138), A08 (725), C15 (679), B09 (494), B67 (530), A66 (654), B12 (829), C81 (629), B10 (388), B94 (839), B85 (782), B46 (688), C70 (687), C24 (275), B75 (172), C06 (124).<br/><br/>Calculating total effort: Let me add them one by one.<br/><br/>Start with A30 (39), B69 (4) = 43.<br/><br/>+ A16 (207): 250.<br/><br/>+ A27 (218): 468.<br/><br/>+ B60 (261): 729.<br/><br/>+ B45 (138): 867.<br/><br/>+ A08 (725): 1592.<br/><br/>+ C15 (679): 2271.<br/><br/>+ B09 (494): 2765.<br/><br/>+ B67 (530): 3295.<br/><br/>+ A66 (654): 3949.<br/><br/>+ B12 (829): 4778.<br/><br/>+ C81 (629): 5407.<br/><br/>+ B10 (388): 5795.<br/><br/>+ B94 (839): 6634.<br/><br/>+ B85 (782): 7416.<br/><br/>+ B46 (688): 8104.<br/><br/>+ C70 (687): 8791.<br/><br/>+ C24 (275): 9066.<br/><br/>+ B75 (172): 9238.<br/><br/>+ C06 (124): 9362.<br/><br/>Total effort used: 9362. Remaining: 9612 - 9362 = 250. So I can include one more item that&#x27;s 250 or less. Looking for items not yet included with effort ≤250.<br/><br/>Looking through the list, what&#x27;s left? A27, A16, A30, B69 are already in. Let me see:<br/><br/>- B75 is 172, already included. C24 is included. C06 is included.<br/><br/>Left are items not included: B53, B12? Wait, B12 is included. Let me check all items.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I&#x27;ve missed some high-importance items that are within the remaining effort.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps A05: effort 593. Too big. B00:928, too big. B53:970, too big. B94:839 included. B67:530 included. B46 included.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe B00:928 is too big, but I haven&#x27;t included it. Wait, maybe I should reconsider my selection because B00 has high importance for me: 583.<br/><br/>But it&#x27;s effort is 928, which is high. Alternatively, perhaps I should prioritize B00 instead of some lower importance items.<br/><br/>Let me think again: my initial selection includes a lot of items but maybe it&#x27;s better to include higher importance ones.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should have selected B00 earlier. Let me recalculate, maybe taking B00 instead of some other items.<br/><br/>B00: effort 928, importance 583.<br/><br/>If I include B00 instead of, say, C81 (629, 713). But C81 has higher importance than B00. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, B00&#x27;s importance is 583, C81 is 713. So C81 is better for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can swap some items. But I think the initial selection is quite good.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should consider including B00 to get its 583 importance, even if it takes up 928 effort.<br/><br/>But I have to see if it&#x27;s worth replacing some other items.<br/><br/>Wait, let me check the current selection&#x27;s total: 9362, with 250 left. If I exclude some items that together use 928, and include B00, would that be better?<br/><br/>For example, if I remove items that use X effort where X ≥928, but I need to ensure the total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed. But 9362 is already close to 9612.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can adjust by removing some lower importance items and adding B00.<br/><br/>But I need to calculate whether the net gain is positive.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let me think about the overall approach: perhaps I should prioritize more on high importance items, even if their effort is high, as long as the total stays within limit.<br/><br/>Since my initial approach focuses on high importance per effort, which is good, but perhaps including B00 is better because 583 is a big chunk, even with high effort.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the total importance if I include B00 in the initial selection.<br/><br/>Suppose I take B00 (928) instead of, say, C81 (629). So, total effort would be:<br/><br/>Previous total effort without C81: 5407 (before adding C81). Adding B00 would make it 5407 + 928 = 6335. Remaining effort 9612 - 6335 = 3277.<br/><br/>But then I can add other items. Let me see.<br/><br/>After B00: effort 928, importance 583.<br/><br/>Then add A30 (39), B69 (4), A16 (207), A27 (218), B60 (261), B45 (138), A08 (725), C15 (679), B09 (494), B67 (530), A66 (654), B12 (829).<br/><br/>Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should approach this differently.<br/><br/>Let me use a step-by-step selection process, prioritizing higher importance per effort, but also considering absolute importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should list all items sorted by (importance / effort) descending, then pick from the top until I reach the limit.<br/><br/>Let me create a sorted list:<br/><br/>Item            Effort    Importance    Ratio (Imp/Eff)<br/>B69             4            97           24.25<br/>A30             39           739           ~18.9487<br/>A16             207          856           ~4.139<br/>A27             218          822           ~3.770<br/>B60             261          808           ~3.097<br/>B45             138          461           ~3.34<br/>C15             679          781           ~1.150<br/>B09             494          786           ~1.591<br/>B67             530          780           ~1.472<br/>C70             687          968           ~1.407<br/>A66             654          822           ~1.257<br/>B10             388          623           ~1.606<br/>B12             829          915           ~1.104<br/>C81             629          713           ~1.133<br/>B46             606          688           ~0.881<br/>A08             725          868           ~1.197<br/>B85             782          400           ~0.512<br/>B94             839          783           ~0.933<br/>C34             834          484           ~0.580<br/>C12             734          668           ~0.909<br/>A84             735          500           ~0.680<br/>B00             928          583           ~0.628<br/>A23             394          262           ~0.665<br/>A05             593          389           ~0.656<br/>C35             577          444           ~0.769<br/>B75             172          235           ~1.367<br/>C24             275          273           ~0.991<br/>C06             124          30            ~0.242<br/>A58             237          457           ~1.928<br/>B70             (not in list)<br/>...<br/>Wait, I think I missed some items. Let me correct that.<br/><br/>Ok, so after B69, A30, then A16, A27, B60, B45, C15, B09, B67, C70, A66, B10, B12, C81, B46, A08, B85, B94, C34, C12, A84, B00, A23, A05, C35, B75, C24, C06, A58, and so on.<br/><br/>So first, B69 and A30 are must-haves because of their high ratio.<br/><br/>Then, A16, A27, B60, B45.<br/><br/>After that, C15, B09, B67, C70, A66, B10, B12, C81, B46.<br/><br/>Wait, but these add up quickly. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Start selecting step by step:<br/><br/>1. B69: effort 4, total used 4, importance 97.<br/><br/>2. A30: 39, total used 43, importance 739. Total so far: 4+39=43, importance 836.<br/><br/>3. A16: 207, total effort 250, importance 856. Total importance: 836 + 856 = 1692.<br/><br/>4. A27: 218, total effort 468, importance 822. Total importance: 2514.<br/><br/>5. B60: 261, total effort 729, importance 808. Total importance: 2514 + 808 = 3322.<br/><br/>6. B45: 138, total effort 867, importance 461. Total importance: 3783.<br/><br/>Now, remaining effort: 9612 - 867 = 8745.<br/><br/>7. C15: 679, total effort 867+679=1546, importance 781. Total importance: 3783+781=4564.<br/><br/>Wait, that can&#x27;t be. Wait, 3783 + 781 is 4564? Wait, no, 3783 + 781 is actually 4564? Wait, no, 3000 + 700 = 3700, 783 + 81 = 864, so yes, 4564.<br/><br/>Wait, but 4564 is less than the previous 3783 + 781. Hmm, I must be making a mistake in addition.<br/><br/>Wait, 3783 + 781: 3000 + 700 = 3700, 700 + 81 is 781. So 3700 + 864? Wait, no, 3783 + 781: 3783 + 700 = 4483, +81=4564. Correct.<br/><br/>Proceeding:<br/><br/>8. B09: 494, total effort 1546 + 494 = 2040, importance 786. Total importance: 4564 + 786 = 5350.<br/><br/>9. B67: 530, total effort 2040 + 530 = 2570, importance 780. Total importance: 5350 + 780 = 6130.<br/><br/>10. C70: 687, total effort 2570 + 687 = 3257, importance 968. Total importance: 6130 + 968 = 7098.<br/><br/>11. A66: 654, total effort 3257 + 654 = 3911, importance 822. Total importance: 7098 + 822 = 7920.<br/><br/>12. B10: 388, total effort 3911 + 388 = 4299, importance 623. Total importance: 7920 + 623 = 8543.<br/><br/>13. B12: 829, total effort 4299 + 829 = 5128, importance 915. Total importance: 8543 + 915 = 9458.<br/><br/>14. C81: 629, total effort 5128 + 629 = 5757, importance 713. Total importance: 9458 + 713 = 10171.<br/><br/>15. B46: 688, total effort 5757 + 688 = 6445, importance 606. Total importance: 10171 + 606 = 10777.<br/><br/>16. A08: 725, total effort 6445 + 725 = 7170, importance 868. Total importance: 10777 + 868 = 11645.<br/><br/>17. B85: 782, total effort 7170 + 782 = 7952, importance 400. Total importance: 11645 + 400 = 12045.<br/><br/>18. B94: 839, total effort 7952 + 839 = 8791, importance 783. Total importance: 12045 + 783 = 12828.<br/><br/>19. C34: 834, but effort left is 9612 - 8791 = 821. So can&#x27;t add. Next, B00: 928, too big. A05:593, too big. Maybe B75: 172, importance 235. Adding that: total effort 8791 + 172 = 8963, importance 12828 + 235 = 13063. Remaining effort: 9612 - 8963 = 649.<br/><br/>20. C24:275, importance 273. Adding that: total effort 8963 + 275 = 9238, importance 13063 + 273 = 13336. Remaining effort: 9612 - 9238 = 374.<br/><br/>21. C06:124, importance 30. Adding that: total effort 9238 + 124 = 9362, importance 13336 +30=13366. Remaining: 250.<br/><br/>22. Check if any small items can fit. Maybe B16:3, but it&#x27;s already included? Wait, I don&#x27;t think I added B16 yet. Wait, in this selection, did I include B16? No, I don&#x27;t think so. B16 has effort 559, which is too big for the remaining 250.<br/><br/>Wait, no, B16 has effort 559, which is larger than 250, so can&#x27;t add. So I can&#x27;t include it. So total effort is 9362, remaining 250, but no more items to add.<br/><br/>Total importance is 13366.<br/><br/>Is this the maximum I can get? Alternatively, perhaps swapping some items can give me a better total.<br/><br/>Let me think: perhaps by including B00 instead of some lower importance items.<br/><br/>B00: effort 928, importance 583. If I include B00, I need to remove items whose total effort is at least 928. But in my current selection, the effort used is 9362, and including B00 would require keeping B00 and adding others within the limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, starting over, let me try including B00 early on.<br/><br/>1. B69:4, importance 97.<br/><br/>2. A30:39, importance 739. Total 43, importance 836.<br/><br/>3. B00:928, total effort 43+928=971, importance 583. Total importance 836+583=1419.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 9612 -971=8641.<br/><br/>4. A16:207, total effort 971+207=1178, importance 856. Total importance 1419+856=2275.<br/><br/>5. A27:218, total 1178+218=1396, importance 822. Total 2275+822=3097.<br/><br/>6. B60:261, 1396+261=1657, importance 808. Total 3097+808=3905.<br/><br/>7. B45:138, 1657+138=1795, importance 461. Total 3905+461=4366.<br/><br/>8. C15:679, 1795+679=2474, importance 781. Total 4366+781=5147.<br/><br/>9. B09:494, 2474+494=2968, importance 786. Total 5147+786=5933.<br/><br/>10. B67:530, 2968+530=3498, importance 780. Total 5933+780=6713.<br/><br/>11. C70:687, 3498+687=4185, importance 968. Total 6713+968=7681.<br/><br/>12. A66:654, 4185+654=4839, importance 822. Total 7681+822=8503.<br/><br/>13. B10:388, 4839+388=5227, importance 623. Total 8503+623=9126.<br/><br/>14. B12:829, 5227+829=6056, importance 915. Total 9126+915=10041.<br/><br/>15. C81:629, 6056+629=6685, importance 713. Total 10041+713=10754.<br/><br/>16. B46:688, 6685+688=7373, importance 606. Total 10754+606=11360.<br/><br/>17. A08:725, 7373+725=8098, importance 868. Total 11360+868=12228.<br/><br/>18. B85:782, 8098+782=8880, importance 400. Total 12228+400=12628.<br/><br/>19. B94:839, 8880+839=9719, importance 783. Total 12628+783=13411.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 9612-9719= -107. Wait, that&#x27;s over. So can&#x27;t do that.<br/><br/>Oops, that&#x27;s a problem. So including B00 made me go over the effort. So I need to check the total effort and see where I went wrong.<br/><br/>Wait, total effort after including A27:1396, B60:1657, B45:1795, C15:2474, B09:2968, B67:3498, C70:4185, A66:4839, B10:5227, B12:6056, C81:6685, B46:7373, A08:8098, B85:8880, B94:9719.<br/><br/>Wait, 9719 &gt;9612. So can&#x27;t include B94. Let me stop before that.<br/><br/>After including B85, effort is 8880, which is under 9612.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 9612 -8880=732.<br/><br/>Now, can I add B94? 839, which is within 732? No. 839 &gt;732. So can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>Other options: Maybe C34:834, which is too big. B46:688, which is over.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can include C70:687? No, already included.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe add smaller items instead of some others.<br/><br/>But this approach is getting too time-consuming. Maybe my initial selection is better with a higher total.<br/><br/>In the initial selection without B00, I have 13366 importance. If I try to include B00 and adjust, perhaps the total importance is lower because of the effort constraints.<br/><br/>Therefore, it&#x27;s better to stick with the initial selection without B00, achieving 13366 importance.<br/><br/>Now, perhaps I can check if there are other items that can be swapped to get a higher total.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including B00 and removing some items with lower importance per effort.<br/><br/>Wait, let me try including B00, and then see what else I can include.<br/><br/>But with B00, I have effort 928, so remaining 9612-928=8684.<br/><br/>Then, proceed to pick the next best items:<br/><br/>A30:39, total effort 928+39=967, importance 583+739=1322.<br/><br/>B69:4, total effort 967+4=971, importance 1322+97=1419.<br/><br/>A16:207, total effort 971+207=1178, importance 1419+856=2275.<br/><br/>A27:218, total effort 1178+218=1396, importance 2275+822=3097.<br/><br/>B60:261, total effort 1396+261=1657, importance 3097+808=3905.<br/><br/>B45:138, total effort 1657+138=1795, importance 3905+461=4366.<br/><br/>C15:679, total 1795+679=2474, importance 4366+781=5147.<br/><br/>B09:494, total 2474+494=2968, importance 5147+786=5933.<br/><br/>B67:530, total 2968+530=3498, importance 5933+780=6713.<br/><br/>C70:687, total 3498+687=4185, importance 6713+968=7681.<br/><br/>A66:654, total 4185+654=4839, importance 7681+822=8503.<br/><br/>B10:388, total 4839+388=5227, importance 8503+623=9126.<br/><br/>B12:829, total 5227+829=6056, importance 9126+915=10041.<br/><br/>C81:629, total 6056+629=6685, importance 10041+713=10754.<br/><br/>B46:688, total 6685+688=7373, importance 10754+606=11360.<br/><br/>A08:725, total 7373+725=8098, importance 11360+868=12228.<br/><br/>B85:782, total 8098+782=8880, importance 12228+400=12628.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 9612-8880=732.<br/><br/>Now, can I include any more items? Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s left.<br/><br/>Looking for items not yet included with effort ≤732.<br/><br/>B94:839 &gt;732, no.<br/><br/>C34:834&gt;732, no.<br/><br/>B46 already included.<br/><br/>B00 already included.<br/><br/>B09 included.<br/><br/>What about C92:743 &gt;732, no.<br/><br/>So perhaps I can&#x27;t add anything else. Total importance is 12628.<br/><br/>But in my initial selection without B00, I had 13366, which is higher. So including B00 gives me less total importance because I have to skip other high-importance items due to effort constraints.<br/><br/>Therefore, it&#x27;s better to not include B00 and instead include other items with higher importance per effort.<br/><br/>So, my initial selection gives higher total importance.<br/><br/>Therefore, I should proceed with the initial selection, which includes:<br/><br/>A30, B69, A16, A27, B60, B45, A08, C15, B09, B67, A66, B12, C81, B46, B94, B85, C70, C24, B75, C06.<br/><br/>Effort total: 9362.<br/><br/>Importance: 13366.<br/><br/>Is there any way to optimize further? Maybe by swapping out lower importance items to include higher ones.<br/><br/>Looking at the included items, let&#x27;s see the importance:<br/><br/>- A30:739<br/>- B69:97<br/>- A16:856<br/>- A27:822<br/>- B60:808<br/>- B45:461<br/>- A08:868<br/>- C15:781<br/>- B09:786<br/>- B67:780<br/>- A66:822<br/>- B12:915<br/>- C81:713<br/>- B46:606<br/>- B94:783<br/>- B85:400<br/>- C70:968<br/>- C24:273<br/>- B75:235<br/>- C06:30.<br/><br/>Looking at the lower importance items: B45 (461), B46 (606), B85 (400), C24 (273), B75 (235), C06 (30). These are the ones with lower individual importance. If I can replace them with higher importance items not included, that might help.<br/><br/>For example, perhaps excluding some of them to include others.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the total effort of these items: B45 (138), B46 (688), B85 (782), C24 (275), B75 (172), C06 (124).<br/><br/>Total effort:138+688=826 +782=1608 +275=1883 +172=2055 +124=2179.<br/><br/>If I remove these items (total effort 2179), I free up 2179 effort. What can I include instead?<br/><br/>What high-importance items did I exclude? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>- B00:928, 583<br/>- A23:394,262<br/>- A05:593,389<br/>- C35:577,444<br/>- C92:743,215<br/>- B53:970,65<br/>- C65:677,121<br/>- B21:935,138<br/>- B53:970,65<br/><br/>Looking for items not included with high importance.<br/><br/>B00:928, importance 583. That&#x27;s significant. So including B00 would take 928 effort, leaving me with 2179 -928=1251.<br/><br/>What&#x27;s left: 1251 effort.<br/><br/>Looking for items not included with high importance:<br/><br/>- A05:593, importance 389. Adding that, effort left:1251-593=658.<br/><br/>- C35:577, importance 444. But 577 &gt;658? No, 577 is within. Adding that, effort used:593+577=1170. Total effort 928+593+577=2098, which is less than the freed 2179. Importance:583+389+444=1416.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the original selection, the removed items gave me total importance of 461+606+400+273+235+30=2005. The proposed new items give 1416, which is less than that. So this swap reduces total importance.<br/><br/>Therefore, not beneficial.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include B00 (928,583) and replace some other items.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps it&#x27;s better to stick with the original set since the proposed swap reduces total importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, think of replacing C06 (30) with a higher importance item.<br/><br/>But C06 is only 30 importance, so perhaps swapping it with a higher one, even if higher effort.<br/><br/>But the effort is small:124. So perhaps replace C06 with an item that has higher importance but slightly higher effort.<br/><br/>Looking for items not included with importance &gt;30 and effort ≤124+ some.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps B16 has effort 559, which is higher than 124, so can&#x27;t. Alternatively, A58:237, which is higher than 124. Maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps replace B75 (172 effort, 235 importance) with a higher importance item.<br/><br/>Looking for items not included with importance &gt;235, effort ≤172.<br/><br/>What&#x27;s available? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>A58:237 effort, 457 importance. 237&gt;172, can&#x27;t include.<br/><br/>A05:593&gt;172.<br/><br/>A23:394&gt;172.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe C06 isn&#x27;t helpful, but it&#x27;s better to keep it for the 30 importance than leave it empty.<br/><br/>Alternatively, it&#x27;s probably best to stick with the original selection as the total is quite high.<br/><br/>So, the final set is:<br/><br/>{&#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;B45&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;B67&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;C81&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B85&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B75&#x27;, &#x27;C06&#x27;}<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: I considered maximizing my total importance by selecting items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios first. I included items like A30, B69, and A16 early due to their high importance relative to their effort. I then added other high-value items while ensuring the total effort remained under the limit, avoiding low-importance items to optimize my total. After evaluating possible swaps and additions, I concluded that the initial selection provides the highest overall importance without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;B45&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;B67&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;C81&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;B85&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B75&#x27;, &#x27;C06&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: This proposal maximizes my total importance within the effort limit by prioritizing high-importance items and efficiently using available effort.</p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I need to work with another participant to agree on a set of items. The goal is to maximize my own total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 9612. Each of us has our own importance values for the items, but we don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s, and we have to negotiate.<br/><br/>First, I think the best approach is to prioritize items that give me the highest importance per unit of effort. That way, I can get the most value without using too much effort. So I&#x27;ll start by calculating the importance-to-effort ratio for each item I have.<br/><br/>Looking at my items, A30 has an importance of 739 and effort of 39. That&#x27;s a really high ratio, so that&#x27;s definitely a top priority. Next, B69 has an importance of 97 and effort of 4, so that&#x27;s also a great ratio. A16 is next with importance 856 and effort 207, which is still a good ratio.<br/><br/>I also notice items like B12 with importance 915 and effort 829. While the ratio isn&#x27;t as high as the first few, it&#x27;s still a high importance item that I should include if possible. Similarly, C70 has a very high importance for me at 968, and its effort is 687. But I need to make sure including it doesn&#x27;t exceed the limit.<br/><br/>I should continue down the list, adding the next highest ratio items until I hit the effort limit. I need to check the total effort as I go. Maybe I can include some middle-range items to fill in without overshooting. Also, I should consider if swapping a lower ratio item with a slightly lower importance but much lower effort could allow me to include more high-importance items elsewhere.<br/><br/>I have to make sure not to reveal my strategy to the other participant, so I&#x27;ll present a proposal that includes these high-value items for me, while hoping the other participant sees the value in it too. I should defend my proposal by arguing that it maximizes efficiency and importance, making it a fair choice for both parties.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to respond in this negotiation game. The user mentioned that their previous attempt didn&#x27;t include the proper strategic reasoning at the very beginning, so I need to make sure I format my response correctly this time.<br/><br/>First, I remember that the interaction protocol has specific tags like STRATEGIC REASONING, PROPOSAL, REFUSE, ARGUMENT, and AGREE. The user emphasized that the very first thing I write must be the STRATEGIC REASONING tag followed by a set. So, I&#x27;ll start my response with that.<br/><br/>Looking at the problem, both participants are trying to maximize their own total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 9612. The user&#x27;s personal importance and the effort for each item are given. My task is to help the user come up with a good proposal that meets the criteria and is likely to be accepted by the opponent.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to strategically select items that have the highest importance-to-effort ratio for the user. This way, the user can get the most importance without using up too much of the effort limit. I&#x27;ll go through each item and calculate the ratio of importance to effort.<br/><br/>For example, items like A30 have high importance (739) with very low effort (39), making their ratio really high. Similarly, B69 has an importance of 97 with an effort of 4, which is also a great ratio. I&#x27;ll prioritize these items first.<br/><br/>Then, I&#x27;ll continue adding other high-ratio items like A16, B12, C70, A08, B60, B94, A66, C81, B46, B85, B67, B09, A27, B45, C24, B75, and C06. I need to ensure that the total effort of all selected items doesn&#x27;t exceed 9612.<br/><br/>After selecting these items, I must check the total effort. If it&#x27;s under the limit, great. If not, I need to consider removing some lower priority items or swapping them with ones that have a better ratio without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Once I have a solid proposal, I&#x27;ll present it using the PROPOSAL tag. I&#x27;ll also include an ARGUMENT tag to explain why this proposal is beneficial, focusing on how it maximizes the user&#x27;s total importance efficiently.<br/><br/>I need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first thing in my response and that I&#x27;m not making any mistakes in the tags or the sets. Also, I should avoid revealing the user&#x27;s importance scores, as per the rules.<br/><br/>So, putting it all together, I&#x27;ll start with the STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, and then the ARGUMENT, all in the correct format. This should help the user negotiate effectively and increase their chances of getting a favorable outcome.<br/></p>
