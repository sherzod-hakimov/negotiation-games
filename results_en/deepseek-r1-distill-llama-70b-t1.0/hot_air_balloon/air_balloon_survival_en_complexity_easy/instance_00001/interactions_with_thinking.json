The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

So, I'm in this negotiation game where I need to agree with another participant on a set of items to keep, without exceeding the effort limit of 8170. Each item has an effort value and an importance value, but I can only see my own importance values. The other person's are hidden. My goal is to maximize my total importance while staying within the effort limit.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what my best possible set of items would be if I were making the choice alone. This is my maximum utility scenario. I'll start by sorting the items based on their importance-to-effort ratio. This ratio tells me which items give me the most importance per unit of effort, so they're more valuable to include.\n\nLooking at my importance values and the effort required for each item, I calculate the importance divided by effort for each. Let me list them out:\n\n- B12: 915 / 80 = 11.4375\n- A16: 856 / 157 \u2248 5.456\n- A30: 739 / 141 \u2248 5.241\n- C15: 781 / 31 \u2248 25.193\n- A08: 868 / 634 \u2248 1.368\n- B67: 780 / 592 \u2248 1.317\n- B00: 583 / 551 \u2248 1.057\n- B10: 623 / 59 \u2248 10.576\n- A27: 822 / 204 \u2248 4.029\n- C81: 713 / 392 \u2248 1.819\n- B94: 783 / 765 \u2248 1.023\n- C34: 484 / 568 \u2248 0.853\n- B85: 400 / 806 \u2248 0.496\n- C24: 273 / 699 \u2248 0.390\n- B21: 138 / 594 \u2248 0.232\n- A05: 389 / 401 \u2248 0.970\n- B60: 808 / 729 \u2248 1.108\n- C92: 215 / 201 \u2248 1.069\n- B69: 97 / 85 = 1.141\n- A84: 500 / 641 \u2248 0.780\n- C06: 30 / 958 \u2248 0.031\n- A23: 262 / 734 \u2248 0.357\n- B53: 65 / 440 \u2248 0.148\n- C35: 444 / 684 \u2248 0.649\n- B45: 461 / 143 \u2248 3.222\n- B09: 786 / 865 ??? Wait, B09's effort is 765, so 786 / 765 \u2248 1.027\n- B16: 3 / 416 \u2248 0.007\n- A58: 457 / 428 \u2248 1.068\n- B75: 235 / 612 \u2248 0.384\n- B46: 606 / 133 \u2248 4.556\n- C70: 105 / 689 \u2248 0.152\n\nHmm, I see that C15 has an extremely high ratio, so I should definitely include that. Also, B12, A16, A30, B10, B45, B46, and B12 are all high. Let me pick the top ones until I reach the effort limit.\n\nStarting with C15: effort 31, importance 781. Total effort so far: 31, total importance: 781.\n\nNext, B12: effort 80, total effort 111, importance +915 = 1696.\n\nThen B10: effort 59, total effort 170, importance +623 = 2319.\n\nNext, B46: 133, total effort 303, importance +606 = 2925.\n\nThen A16: 157, total effort 460, importance +856 = 3781.\n\nA30: 141, effort 601, importance +739 = 4520.\n\nB45: 143, effort 744, importance +461 = 4981.\n\nB21: 594 would push effort to 1338, which is way over. So maybe stop here? Wait, let me check the total effort: 31 + 80 + 59 +133 +157 +141 +143. Let me add them:\n\n31+80=111, +59=170, +133=303, +157=460, +141=601, +143=744. Total effort 744.\n\nBut the effort limit is 8170, so I have a lot of room left. So maybe I can include more items.\n\nNext high ratio items:\n\nLooking back, B12, B10, B46, A16, A30, B45 are already included. Next would be B09: 765 effort, but that's a large chunk. 744 +765 way exceeds 8170? Wait, 744 +765 is 1509, still way under. But maybe other higher ratio items are better.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize items with the highest ratio first. Let me re-examine the sorted list.\n\nAfter C15 comes B12, then A30, then B10, then A16, then B46, then B45, then A27, then C81, then B67, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me correct the order properly.\n\nLet me list all the items with their ratio:\n\n1. C15: 25.193\n2. B12: 11.4375\n3. B10: 10.576\n4. B45: 3.222\n5. B46: 4.556 (Wait, 4.556 is higher than B45's 3.222)\nWait, no: 4.556 is higher than 3.222, so the order would be:\n\n1. C15\n2. B12\n3. B10\n4. B46\n5. A16\n6. A30\n7. B45\n8. A27\n9. C81\n10. B09\n11. B67\n12. B00\n13. B60\n14. C92\n15. B69\n16. B94\n17. A84\n18. B21\n19. A05\n20. C34\n21. A58\n22. B09 again? Maybe I have a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a more accurate list.\n\nLet me sort all items properly:\n\n1. C15: 781 / 31 \u224825.193\n2. B12:915 /80=11.4375\n3. B10:623 /59\u224810.576\n4. B46:606 /133\u22484.556\n5. A16:856 /157\u22485.456\n6. A30:739 /141\u22485.241\n7. B45:461 /143\u22483.222\n8. A27:822 /204\u22484.029\n9. C81:713 /392\u22481.819\n10. B67:780 /592\u22481.317\n11. B00:583 /551\u22481.057\n12. B60:808 /729\u22481.108\n13. C92:215 /201\u22481.069\n14. B69:97 /85=1.141\n15. B94:783 /765\u22481.023\n16. A05:389 /401\u22480.970\n17. B09:786 /765\u22481.027\n18. A84:500 /641\u22480.780\n19. C34:484 /568\u22480.853\n20. B85:400 /806\u22480.496\n21. C24:273 /699\u22480.390\n22. A23:262 /734\u22480.357\n23. B53:65 /440\u22480.148\n24. C35:444 /684\u22480.649\n25. B21:138 /594\u22480.232\n26. A58:457 /428\u22481.068\n27. B75:235 /612\u22480.384\n28. C70:105 /689\u22480.152\n29. B16:3 /416\u22480.007\n30. C06:30 /958\u22480.031\n\nNow, I can see the correct order.\n\nSo, starting with C15 (31 effort, 781 imp), then B12 (80, 915), then B10 (59,623), then B46 (133,606), then A16 (157,856), A30 (141,739), then A27 (204,822), then B45 (143,461), then C81 (392,713), then B67 (592,780), etc.\n\nAdding these one by one until effort reaches 8170.\n\nLet me start selecting:\n\n1. C15: Effort=31, Imp=781. Total:31, 781.\n2. B12: +80=111, +915=1696.\n3. B10: +59=170, +623=2319.\n4. B46: +133=303, +606=2925.\n5. A16: +157=460, +856=3781.\n6. A30: +141=601, +739=4520.\n7. A27: +204=805, +822=5342.\n8. B45: +143=948, +461=5803.\n9. C81: +392=1340, +713=6516.\n10. B67: +592=1932, +780=7296.\n11. B00: +551=2483, +583=7879. Now, 2483+551=3034, and 7879.\n12. Next, B60:729. Adding 729 to 3034 is 3763, which is under 8170. Imp +808=8687.\n13. Next, B69:85. Total effort 3763+85=3848. Imp +97=8784.\n14. B94:765. 3848+765=4613. Imp +783=9567.\n15. B09:765. 4613+765=5378. Imp +786=10353.\n16. C92:201. 5378+201=5579. Imp +215=10568.\n17. A05:401. 5579+401=5980. Imp +389=10957.\n18. A84:641. 5980+641=6621. Imp +500=11457.\n19. C34:568. 6621+568=7189. Imp +484=11941.\n20. B85:806. 7189+806=7995. Imp +400=12341.\n21. Now, remaining effort is 8170-7995=175. Let me check items not yet added with effort \u2264175. \n\nLooking for items not yet included, with effort <=175.\n\nLooking at the list, perhaps items like B21 (594) is too big. Maybe B53 (440) too big. Wait, no: effort left is 175, so need items with effort \u2264175.\n\nCheck items not added yet: A05 is 401, which is too big. B16:416 is too big. C35:684 too big. C24:699 too big. A23:734 too big. C06:958 too big. B75:612 too big. C70:689 too big. B16:416. So, are there any items with effort \u2264175 left?\n\nLooking back, items already added up to B85. What's left? Let's see the remaining items:\n\n- B21:594 (too big)\n- B53:440 (too big)\n- C35:684 (too big)\n- B09 is already added. Wait, no, B09 was added earlier. What about C24:699 (too big). A23:734. B53:440.\n\nWait, are there any small effort items left? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the initial list, are there items with effort \u2264175 that I haven't added yet?\n\nYes, for example, B16 has effort 416 which is too big, but wait, maybe C92 is 201, which I added earlier. So maybe there's no more items left with effort \u2264175 except perhaps those with very low importance.\n\nWait, B16: effort 416 is still too big. What about A27 is already added. B69 is 85, added. B09 is 765, added.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some small effort items. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all items again:\n\n- A16:157 (already added)\n- A27:204 (added)\n- B12:80 (added)\n- B10:59 (added)\n- B46:133 (added)\n- B45:143 (added)\n- C92:201 (added)\n- B69:85 (added)\n- B16:416 (too big)\n- etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can't add any more items without exceeding the effort limit. So the total effort is 7995, with total importance 12341.\n\nWait, but maybe I can swap some items to include more high-importance items with lower effort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if any items not in my current set have higher importance per effort and see if swapping can give me more total importance.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. For the purpose of this negotiation, I probably don't need to compute the optimal, but knowing that my best case is around 12341 importance.\n\nNow, the other participant's perspective is unknown. Since I don't know their importance values, it's hard to predict what they might prioritize. However, they might be trying to do the same\u2014maximize their own importance. Therefore, the negotiation may involve including items that are more valuable to both of us or trading off items where one values highly and the other doesn't.\n\nMy strategy should be to start by proposing a set that includes my highest importance items while leaving room for compromise. Perhaps I can start with a smaller set and see how the other responds, or go for a larger set and be willing to adjust based on their feedback.\n\nAnother approach is to find items that have high importance for me but low effort, as these are efficient.Including them would allow me to save effort for other items. For example, B10 (effort 59, imp 623), B12 (80,915), C15 (31,781) are all high ratio and low effort, so it's good to include them.\n\nConsidering that, my initial proposal might include these high-value items and see if the other accepts. If not, I can try adding or removing items based on their counterproposals.\n\nI should also consider that the other might have some must-have items, so perhaps including some of their high-importance items (if I can guess) or being flexible could help reach an agreement.\n\nBut without knowing their priorities, I'll proceed by making a strong initial proposal that maximizes my own utility while leaving some room for negotiation.\n\nI'll start with the set: C15, B12, B10, B46, A16, A30, A27, B45, C81, B67, B00, B60, B69, B94, B09, C92, A05, A84, C34, B85.\n\nWait, but the effort sum was 7995, leaving 175 left. Perhaps I can try adding another item if possible. Let's check if any item has effort \u2264175 that I haven't included yet.\n\nLooking back, B09 is 765 (already included). B16 is 416. Hmm, maybe B16 is 416, which is too big. What about other small effort items?\n\nWait, I have B69:85, which is included. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps I can include an additional item with effort 175 or less. For example, C92 is 201, which I have already included. Any other?\n\nWait, maybe C35:684 which is too big. C24:699 too big. So perhaps I can't add any more. So my best set is as above, totaling 7995 effort and 12341 importance.\n\nBut in the negotiation, I might not need to include all these. Maybe starting with a smaller set and seeing how the other reacts could be better. Alternatively, propose a set that uses most of the effort limit to show willingness to compromise.\n\nNow, perhaps I should make a PROPOSAL of this set and see how the opponent responds. Or maybe make a PROPOSAL that is a bit less, leaving some room for the opponent to add their important items.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that the total effort doesn't exceed 8170. So in my best case, I have 7995, leaving 175. Maybe I can include one more small item.\n\nLooking through the remaining items: what's left? A05 is 401, which is too big. B53 is 440, too big. C35:684 too big. So I can't add any more items without exceeding 8170? Wait, 7995 + 175 is 8170. So if I have an item with effort 175 or less, I can add it. Do I have any left? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the items not yet included:\n\nFrom the effort list, perhaps items like B21:594 (too big), B53:440 (too big), C35:684 (too big), etc. Are there any smaller ones? Wait, the only small ones were already included, like B10, B12, B46, etc. So I think I can't add any more.\n\nThus, my best possible proposal is the set as above, totaling 7995 effort. Now, I'll proceed to make this proposal and see how the game goes.\n",

                    "content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's mistake. They forgot to start their message with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag, which is a rule in this negotiation game. I remember the rules say that every message must begin with that tag, hidden from the other player, and it's only used once. \n\nFirst, I should probably point out the error so they can correct it. But I can't just tell them directly; I have to follow the structure. So I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. Maybe I should explain why their previous attempt didn't work and guide them on how to fix it. \n\nI also need to think about their approach. They proposed a set of items, which is good, but without starting with the strategic reasoning, it's invalid. So in my response, I should make sure I start correctly and then perhaps continue with their proposal and argument. \n\nWait, no, they were the one who made the mistake, so I should correct them and perhaps make a counter-proposal. Or maybe just adhere strictly to the structure they were supposed to follow. Since they included a PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT, I might need to respond appropriately by refusing or agreeing or making a counter offer.\n\nHmm, but in their message, they included PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT, so perhaps I should respond as per the game rules. Since it's my turn now, maybe I should propose my own set of items after starting with the strategic reasoning.\n\nI should list out the items I want to keep, making sure their total effort doesn't exceed the limit, and choose the ones that are most important to me. Maybe I should prioritize items where my importance is high and their effort is low. \n\nWait, but the user didn't provide the other player's importance, so I need to base it on my own. Let me check the item importances again.\n\nLooking at the items, A16 has high importance, 856, and effort 157. B12 has 915 importance and effort 80, which is really good. B10 has 623 importance with effort 59. A30 is 739 with 141. So including these would make sense.\n\nBut I should try to include as many high-importance, low-effort items as possible. Let me calculate the total effort for the set they proposed. Let's see:\n\nC15:781, effort 31  \nB12:915, 80  \nB10:623, 59  \nB46:606, 133  \nA16:856, 157  \nA30:739, 141  \nA27:822, 204  \nB45:461, 143  \nC81:713, 392  \nB67:780, 592  \nB00:583, 551  \nB60:808, 729  \nB69:97, 85  \nB94:783, 557  \nB09:786, 765  \nC92:215, 201  \nA05:389, 401  \nA84:500, 641  \nC34:484, 568  \nB85:400, 806  \n\nWait, adding these up: \n\n31 +80=111, +59=170, +133=303, +157=460, +141=601, +204=805, +143=948, +392=1340, +592=1932, +551=2483, +729=3212, +85=3297, +557=3854, +765=4619, +201=4820, +401=5221, +641=5862, +568=6430, +806=7236.\n\nWait, that way over the limit of 8170? No, 7236 is under, but wait, is that correct? Wait, 31+80=111, +59=170, +133=303, +157=460, +141=601, +204=805, +143=948, +392=1340, +592=1932, +551=2483, +729=3212, +85=3297, +557=3854, +765=4619, +201=4820, +401=5221, +641=5862, +568=6430, +806=7236. Yep, 7236 which is under 8170.\n\nSo their proposal is under the effort limit. Now, considering that, perhaps I should accept it, but maybe I can try to get more value. Alternatively, I can refuse and make my own proposal.\n\nBut in their response, they had a mistake, so perhaps I should point that out. But according to the rules, the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by other tags like PROPOSAL, ARGUMENT, etc.\n\nIn my next message, I should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then perhaps make a PROPOSAL or argue against theirs.\n\nSo, to correct their mistake, I should structure my response properly. Let me outline the strategic reasoning: I need to maximize my own importance while not exceeding the effort limit. I'll prioritize items with high importance and low effort.\n\nThen, I can propose a set of items that fit within the limit and have high total importance for me. Alternatively, I can accept their proposal if it's beneficial to me.\n\nWait, looking at their proposed set, the total effort is 7236, leaving some room. Maybe I can add more items to increase my total importance. Let me see which items are left.\n\nLooking at the items not in their proposal:\n\nA08:868 importance, effort 634  \nA23:262,734  \nA58:457,428  \nA66:822,606  \nA05:389,401  \nB53:65,440  \nB16:3,416  \nC06:30,958  \nC24:273,699  \nC35:444,684  \nC70:105,689  \n\nWait, some of these might be possible to include. For example, A08 has high importance but high effort. Maybe adding some smaller ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can replace some of their items with others to get a better total for myself. But since I don't know their importance values, it's tricky. But as the other player, I should focus on my own gains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept their proposal since it's a good set. Or make a counter proposal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should Refuse their proposal and make a better one. Let me think about which items I can include with high importance and lower effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to start fresh, selecting the items that give me the highest total importance without exceeding the limit.\n\nLet me prioritize based on my importance divided by effort.\n\nCalculating importance per effort for each item:\n\n- B12:915 /80=11.4375  \n- A30:739/141\u22485.24  \n- B10:623/59\u224810.56  \n- A16:856/157\u22485.45  \n- C15:781/31\u224825.19  \n- B46:606/133\u22484.56  \n- B00:583/551\u22481.06  \n- A27:822/204\u22484.03  \n- B45:461/143\u22483.22  \n- C81:713/392\u22481.82  \n- B67:780/592\u22481.32  \n- B60:808/729\u22481.11  \n- B94:783/557\u22481.40  \n- B09:786/765\u22481.03  \n- C92:215/201\u22481.07  \n- A05:389/401\u22480.97  \n- A84:500/641\u22480.78  \n- C34:484/568\u22480.85  \n- B85:400/806\u22480.496  \nAlso, other items not in their proposal:\n\nA08:868/634\u22481.37  \nA23:262/734\u22480.357  \nA58:457/428\u22481.07  \nA66:822/606\u22481.355  \nB53:65/440\u22480.148  \nB16:3/416\u22480.007  \nC06:30/958\u22480.031  \nC24:273/699\u22480.390  \nC35:444/684\u22480.649  \nC70:105/689\u22480.152  \n\nSo the best ratios are for C15, B12, B10, A30, A16, etc.\n\nIn their proposal, they have C15, B12, B10, B46, A16, A30, etc., which are mostly high ratio items. So perhaps their proposal is already quite efficient. But maybe I can tweak it by replacing some lower ratio items with others to get a better total.\n\nFor example, maybe remove B00, which has a low importance per effort, and add A66, which has a higher importance per effort. Let's see: effort of B00 is 551, which would be freed up. Adding A66 which is 606. So the net effort would be -551 +606=55. The limit is 8170, their total effort is 7236, so adding 55 would make it 7291, still under.\n\nSo replace B00 with A66. Let's check the total importance change: removing B00 (583) and adding A66 (822) increases total importance by 239.\n\nSo that would be better for me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace multiple low ratio items. Let's see.\n\nLooking at their proposal, B00 is 583/551\u22481.06, which is lower than some other items. Also, C92 is 215/201\u22481.07, which is also low. A05 is 389/401\u22480.97. B60 is 808/729\u22481.11.\n\nSo perhaps removing B00, C92, A05, and B60, and replacing them with higher ratio items.\n\nTotal effort freed: 551 +201 +401 +729 = 1882.\n\nIf I can add items with total effort up to 1882, which would not exceed the limit.\n\nLooking for items not in their proposal that have high importance per effort:\n\nA08:868/634\u22481.37  \nA66:822/606\u22481.355  \nA58:457/428\u22481.07  \nC35:444/684\u22480.649  \nC70:105/689\u22480.152  \n\nWait, C35 and C70 are low. So perhaps adding A66 and A08.\n\nWait, A08 has effort 634, and A66 is 606. Together, 634+606=1240, which is under the freed 1882.\n\nSo replacing those four items (total effort 1882) with A08 and A66 (total effort 1240) would free up 642 effort. Then, perhaps add more items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps add A08, A66, and another small one. But A08 and A66 require 634+606=1240.\n\nSo I can add those, and with the remaining effort (1882-1240=642), perhaps add A23 (734) but that's too high. Or A58 (428). \n\nA58's effort is 428, so adding that would bring total effort to 1240+428=1668, which is still under 1882.\n\nSo replacing B00, C92, A05, B60 with A08, A66, A58 would free up effort and increase importance.\n\nLet me calculate the total effort:\n\nOriginal set: 7236\n\nReplacing 551(B00)+729(B60)+401(A05)+201(C92)=1882\n\nAdding 634(A08)+606(A66)+428(A58)=1668\n\nNet change: 1668-1882= -214\n\nNew total effort: 7236 - 1882 + 1668= 7236 -214=7022, which is still under 8170.\n\nImportance change: removing 583(B00)+808(B60)+389(A05)+215(C92)=583+808=1391 +389=1780 +215=1995.\n\nAdding 868(A08)+822(A66)+457(A58)=868+822=1690 +457=2147.\n\nTotal importance gain: 2147 -1995=152.\n\nSo that's better for me. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can add more items with the remaining effort.\n\nAfter replacing, I have 7022. The remaining effort is 8170-7022=1148.\n\nLooking for items not in the set yet: \n\nA23:734, A58:428 (already added in this scenario), B53:440, B16:416, C06:958, C24:699, C35:684, C70:689.\n\nWait,  A58 is now included, so the remaining items are those. Let's see, which of these can fit into 1148.\n\nA23:734, if I add that, effort becomes 7022+734=7756, leaving 8170-7756=414.\n\nThen, perhaps add B53:440, total effort 7756+440=8196, which is over by 26. Alternatively, B16:416, total 7756+416=8172, which is over by 2.\n\nHmm, close. Maybe not ideal. Alternatively, perhaps add C24:699, which would make 7022+699=7721, leaving 8170-7721=449. Then maybe add B53:440, total 7721+440=8161, leaving 9. Not enough for anything. So total effort 8161, which is under.\n\nSo adding A23 and C24, that would be 734+699=1433, bringing total effort to 7022+1433=8455, which is way over. Wait no, I think I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no: 7022 (after initial replacement) + A23 (734) = 7756, then adding B53 (440) would be 8196, which is over. But if I just add B53, 440, then 7022+440=7462, leaving 708. Then perhaps add C24:699, total 7462+699=8161, which is under. So total effort 8161, with items: A23, B53, C24.\n\nSo that way, the total set would be the original proposal minus B00, B60, A05, C92, plus A08, A66, A58, A23, B53, C24.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to make a new clean proposal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial proposal made by the user is already quite good, but I can suggest modifications to improve it for both parties.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's priorities, I have to focus on mine. So perhaps I should make a counter-proposal that maximizes my own importance.\n\nIn any case, I should start my message with STRATEGIC REASONING, then make a PROPOSAL.\n\nSo, I'll start with STRATEGIC REASONING, outlining my plan to maximize my own importance by selecting high-importance, low-effort items, and then make a PROPOSAL accordingly.\n",

They proposed a set of items, and I have to decide whether to accept it, refuse it, or make a counter-proposal. But before doing anything, I need to remember the rules and the structure I must follow.\n\nFirst, my main goal is to maximize my own total importance while staying under the effort limit of 8170. I don't know what the other player values, so I can't directly compare our priorities. But I can focus on my own importance scores and the effort required for each item.\n\nLooking at the previous interaction, I proposed a set, and the other player refused it. Then I got a message that said my response didn't start with the proper strategic reasoning tag. That means the last time I tried to make a move, I probably made a formatting mistake. I need to avoid that this time.\n\nSo, the first thing in my response must be a STRATEGIC REASONING tag. This is where I outline my thoughts without revealing my importance scores. I have to make sure that this is the very first thing in my message.\n\nNext, I need to evaluate the opponent's proposal. They proposed a set of items, and I have to check two things: does the total effort stay within the limit, and does it maximize my importance?\n\nI should list out the items in their proposal, sum up their efforts, and ensure it's \u22648170. Then, I'll calculate the total importance of those items from my perspective. If the total effort is within the limit and I can't find a better combination that gives me a higher importance without exceeding the effort limit, maybe I should agree. If not, I should either refuse or make a better proposal.\n\nBut wait, in my last attempt, I might have forgotten to include the strategic reasoning, so the system probably didn't process my move correctly. This time, I need to make sure I follow the structure strictly.\n\nSo, for this response, I'll start with the STRATEGIC REASONING, then decide whether to AGREE, PROPOSE, or REFUSE based on my calculations.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total effort of the opponent's last proposal. If it's over the limit, I can safely refuse it. If it's under, check if I can get a higher total importance with another set without exceeding the effort.\n\n2. Since I don't have the opponent's response yet, I might not have a specific proposal to react to, so I might need to propose a new set that benefits me more.\n\n3. Make sure my proposal doesn't reveal my importance scores but considers the effort and my priorities.\n\nI think the best move is to create a new proposal that includes the items I value most but stays within the effort limit. I'll prioritize items with high importance to me and lower effort. This way, I can maximize my total without using too much effort.\n\nLet me list all the items with their effort and my importance:\n\n- B21: 594, 138\n- B00: 551, 583\n- A08: 634, 868\n- A27: 204, 822\n- B94: 557, 783\n- B53: 440, 65\n- A23: 734, 262\n- C65: 893, 121\n- A89: 246, 508\n- B67: 592, 780\n- B45: 143, 461\n- C34: 568, 484\n- C12: 472, 668\n- A05: 401, 389\n- B60: 729, 808\n- C92: 201, 215\n- B69: 85, 97\n- A84: 641, 500\n- C06: 958, 30\n- B12: 80, 915\n- A16: 157, 856\n- B85: 806, 400\n- C35: 684, 444\n- B10: 59, 623\n- C15: 31, 781\n- B09: 765, 786\n- B16: 416, 3\n- C81: 392, 713\n- A58: 428, 457\n- C24: 699, 273\n- A30: 141, 739\n- A66: 606, 822\n- B75: 612, 235\n- B46: 133, 606\n- C70: 689, 105\n\nLooking through these, items like B12 has high importance (915) and low effort (80), so that's a good pick. A16, A30, A27, B00, etc., also have high importance relative to their effort.\n\nI think including these high-importance, low-effort items first would be best. Then see how much effort is left and fill in with other high-importance items.\n\nLet me try to calculate a possible set:\n\nStart with B12 (80), A16 (157), B10 (59), B46 (133), A30 (141), A27 (204), B45 (143), C81 (392), B67 (592) \u2013 that's 9 items.\n\nTotal effort so far: 80 + 157 + 59 + 133 + 141 + 204 + 143 + 392 + 592 = Let me add step by step:\n\n80 + 157 = 237\n\n237 +59 = 296\n\n296 +133= 429\n\n429 +141=570\n\n570 +204=774\n\n774 +143=917\n\n917 +392=1309\n\n1309 +592=1901\n\nSo total effort is 1901. That's way under 8170. I can definitely add more.\n\nNext, A08 (634, 868) \u2013 important but high effort. Maybe include it.\n\n1901 +634=2535.\n\nAdding A66 (606, 822) \u2013 high importance.\n\n2535+606=3141\n\nAdding B00 (551,583) \u2013 high importance.\n\n3141+551=3692\n\nAdding B94 (557,783)\n\n3692+557=4249\n\nAdding A66 is already added; next could be C15 (31,781)\n\n4249 +31=4280\n\nAdding C92 (201,215)\n\n4280+201=4481\n\nAdding A84 (641,500)\n\n4481+641=5122\n\nAdding B09 (765,786) \u2013 important, but high effort.\n\n5122+765=5887\n\nThat's still under 8170 (5887). Maybe add C34 (568,484)\n\n5887+568=6455\n\nStill have space. Next, B60 (729,808)\n\n6455+729=7184\n\nClose to limit. Maybe add B85 (806,400) but that would exceed (7184+806=7990). Hmm, no, wait, 7184+806=7990, which is under 8170.\n\n7990. Then maybe add more? Let's see what's left.\n\nLooking at efforts left: 8170-7990=180.\n\nLooking for items with effort \u2264180. Maybe C70 (689,105) is too high. B16 (416,3) is possible but low importance. B69 (85,97) \u2013 low importance. B53 (440,65) too high. B09 is already included. C24 (699,273) too high. B75 (612,235) too high. C06 (958,30) too high. B21 (594,138) too high. A23 (734,262) too high. A05 (401,389) might be possible if effort left. Wait, 8170 -7990=180. A05 is 401, which is too big.\n\nSo maybe stop here.\n\nThis gives a total importance from my perspective: sum all the importance of selected items.\n\nCalculating:\n\nB12:915\n\nA16:856\n\nB10:623\n\nB46:606\n\nA30:739\n\nA27:822\n\nB45:461\n\nC81:713\n\nB67:780\n\nA08:868\n\nA66:822\n\nB00:583\n\nB94:783\n\nC15:781\n\nC92:215\n\nA84:500\n\nB09:786\n\nC34:484\n\nB60:808\n\nB85:400\n\nAdding them up:\n\n915 +856 = 1771\n\n+623=2394\n\n+606=3000\n\n+739=3739\n\n+822=4561\n\n+461=5022\n\n+713=5735\n\n+780=6515\n\n+868=7383\n\n+822=8205\n\n+583=8788\n\n+783=9571\n\n+781=10352\n\n+215=10567\n\n+500=11067\n\n+786=11853\n\n+484=12337\n\n+808=13145\n\n+400=13545\n\nEffort total:7990; Importance total:13,545.\n\nBut maybe I can find a better combination with higher importance. Let me check if I can swap some items.\n\nFor example, B85 requires 806 effort and gives me 400 importance. Maybe replace it with other items. 806 effort could be replaced by items that give higher importance.\n\nLooking for items not included yet with effort \u2264806. For example, A05 has effort 401 and importance 389 \u2013 but that's lower than 400. Maybe C35 (684,444). Effort 684. 806-684=122. Maybe include C35 and another item with effort \u2264122.\n\nC35:684, importance 444; then with 122 left, maybe B16 (416) is too high, B69 (85), but 85 is low. Not much. So C35 alone would give me +444 vs B85's 400.\n\nThat's better. So replace B85 with C35.\n\nNow effort:7990-806=7184; add 684, so 7184+684=7868, which is still under 8170.\n\nImportance:13545-400=13145 +444=13589.\n\nBetter.\n\nSo new set includes C35 instead of B85.\n\nAlternatively, can I add more items?\n\nEffort left:8170-7868=302.\n\nLooking for items with effort \u2264302. Maybe A05 (401) is too high, B53 (440) too high, B10 is already included, B45 is included. C92 (201) is already included. B69 (85), but low importance. Maybe B16 (416) too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including A05 (401): 7868 +401=8269>8170. So no. Maybe C92 is included; already.\n\nSo, perhaps this is better.\n\nAlternatively, instead of replacing, can I find a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude C34 (568,484) and include A05 (401,389) and others.\n\nWait, effort saved by excluding C34:568.\n\nC34's importance is 484.\n\nIf I exclude C34 and instead include A05 and some small items:\n\nEffort available:568.\n\nA05:401, leaving 167. Maybe A58 (428) is too high. Or B69 (85), but low importance. Maybe B00 is already included.\n\nNot sure if this swap would help. Maybe keep C34.\n\nAlternatively, maybe drop C34 and B85 and replace with other items.\n\nI think it's getting too complicated. So perhaps proceed with the proposal I have.\n\nWait, but this might be too time-consuming. Maybe just proceed with the initial set, ensuring I include the high-importance items first.\n\nIn the previous messages, the other player kept sending STRATEGIC REASONING and PROPOSAL. So I should structure my response the same way.\n\nSo, in the response, I should:\n\n1. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING explaining my approach.\n2. Then present a PROPOSAL set.\n3. Optionally, provide an ARGUMENT.\n\nBut the last time, it was mentioned that the response didn't start with the proper tag, so I have to make sure the very first thing is STRATEGIC REASONING.\n\nAlso, I must not reveal my importance scores in the strategic reasoning. So I can say something like prioritizing high importance and optimizing effort.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I aim to maximize my total importance by selecting high-importance items while ensuring the total effort stays within the limit. I will prioritize items with the highest importance relative to their effort.\n\nThen, propose the set.\n\nARGUMENT: This set includes high-importance items that provide the best balance between effort and my personal value, ensuring we stay within the effort limit while maximizing my benefit.\n\nHmm, but the items I calculated might not be in the exact list. Wait, let me cross-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the previous proposal included many of my high-importance items, but maybe I can propose a more optimized set.\n\nAlternatively, to make it easier, I can propose a set of all items that are high importance with low effort.\n\nLooking again, perhaps including B12, A16, A30, A27, B45, C81, B67, B94, B09, A08, A66, B00, C15, C92, A84, C34, B60, C35.\n\nThis seems similar to what I had before.\n\nIn the end, I think the key is to structure the response correctly, starting with the strategic reasoning and then the proposal, ensuring I follow the format.\n\nI need to make sure that in my response, I don't reveal my own importance scores in the strategic reasoning. I can talk about high-importance items without specifying what they are.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, I'll structure the response with the proper tags and propose a set that includes my high-importance, low-effort items.\n",
