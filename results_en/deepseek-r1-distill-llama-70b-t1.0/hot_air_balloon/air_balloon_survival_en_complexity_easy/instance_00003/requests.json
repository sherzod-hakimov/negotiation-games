This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this negotiation. The goal is to maximize my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 8770. I don't know what the other person's importance values are, so I have to make educated guesses based on their possible strategies.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the items with their effort and my importance. Let me make a list sorted maybe by the effort or by the importance. Hmm, maybe I should prioritize items that give me the highest importance per unit effort. That way, I can maximize my gain without exceeding the limit.\n\nLooking at the items, I see B00 has an importance of 583 and effort 638. That's a good ratio. A08 has 868 importance and 607 effort, which is also high. A16 is 856 with 645 effort. Those seem good. Also, B12 has high importance for me, 915, but it's a bit high on effort at 946. Maybe I can include that if it fits.\n\nI should aim to pick the highest importance per effort items first. Let me calculate the importance per effort for each:\n\n- B12: 915/946 ≈ 0.968\n- A16: 856/645 ≈ 1.327\n- A08: 868/607 ≈ 1.429\n- B00: 583/638 ≈ 0.913\n- B94: 783/630 ≈ 1.243\n- B67: 780/634 ≈ 1.231\n- C12: 668/849 ≈ 0.787\n- B60: 808/324 ≈ 2.494\n- A23: 262/773 ≈ 0.339\n- A05: 389/801 ≈ 0.485\n- A27: 822/106 ≈ 7.75\n- B45: 461/60 ≈ 7.683\n- C34: 484/54 ≈ 8.963\n- B10: 623/116 ≈ 5.371\n- C15: 781/875 ≈ 0.892\n- B85: 400/842 ≈ 0.475\n- C35: 444/106 ≈ 4.189\n- B09: 786/446 ≈ 1.762\n- B16: 3/649 ≈ 0.005\n- C81: 713/601 ≈ 1.187\n- A58: 457/252 ≈ 1.813\n- C24: 273/763 ≈ 0.357\n- A30: 739/213 ≈ 3.468\n- A66: 822/517 ≈ 1.589\n- B75: 235/520 ≈ 0.452\n- B46: 606/407 ≈ 1.488\n- C70: 968/125 ≈ 7.744\n\nWow, some of these have really high importance per effort. A27, B45, C34, B10, C35, A30, C70, and maybe some others are way up there. But I need to make sure the total effort doesn't exceed 8770. \n\nMaybe I should start by selecting the top ones. Let's list them in order of importance per effort:\n\n1. C34: 8.963\n2. B45: 7.683\n3. A27: 7.75 (Wait, A27 is higher than B45. So A27 first)\n4. C70: 7.744\n5. B10: 5.371\n6. A30: 3.468\n7. C35: 4.189\n8. B09: 1.762\n9. A58: 1.813\n10. A16: 1.327\n11. B94: 1.243\n12. B67: 1.231\n13. A66: 1.589\n14. B46: 1.488\n15. C81: 1.187\n16. B00: 0.913\n17. C15: 0.892\n18. B12: 0.968\n19. A08: 1.429\n20. B60: 2.494\n\nWait, I think I messed up the ordering. Let me correct that by actually ranking from highest to lowest importance per effort:\n\n1. C34 (8.963)\n2. A27 (7.75)\n3. C70 (7.744)\n4. B45 (7.683)\n5. B10 (5.371)\n6. C35 (4.189)\n7. A30 (3.468)\n8. B09 (1.762)\n9. A58 (1.813)\n10. A16 (1.327)\n11. B94 (1.243)\n12. B67 (1.231)\n13. A66 (1.589)\n14. B46 (1.488)\n15. C81 (1.187)\n16. B00 (0.913)\n17. C15 (0.892)\n18. B12 (0.968)\n19. A08 (1.429)\n20. B60 (2.494)\n\nWait, B60 has 2.494 which is higher than B09, A58, etc. So correct order:\n\nWait, I think I need to redo this properly. Let me list them all with their ratios:\n\n- C34: 8.963\n- A27: 7.75\n- C70: 7.744\n- B45: 7.683\n- B10: 5.371\n- C35: 4.189\n- A30: 3.468\n- B60: 2.494\n- A58: 1.813\n- B09: 1.762\n- A66: 1.589\n- A08: 1.429\n- A16: 1.327\n- B94: 1.243\n- B67: 1.231\n- B46: 1.488\n- C81: 1.187\n- B12: 0.968\n- B00: 0.913\n- C15: 0.892\n- C12: 668/849 ≈ 0.787\n- B85: 400/842 ≈ 0.475\n- A23: 262/773 ≈ 0.339\n- C24: 273/763 ≈ 0.357\n- A05: 389/801 ≈ 0.485\n- B75: 235/520 ≈ 0.452\n- C92: 215/164 ≈ 1.311 (Wait, C92's importance is 215, effort 164, so 1.311)\n- B69: 97/832 ≈ 0.116\n- A84: 500/136 ≈ 3.676 (Wait, I missed A84 earlier)\n- C06: 30/980 ≈ 0.031\n- B16: 3/649 ≈ 0.005\n\nWait, so I missed some in my previous listing. Let's correct the ratios:\n\nLooking back, A84 has importance 500, effort 136 → 500/136 ≈ 3.676. That's higher than B09 and others. Also, C92 is 215/164 ≈ 1.311.\n\nSo the correct order should include these. Let me recalculate all:\n\n1. C34: 8.963\n2. A27: 7.75\n3. C70: 7.744\n4. B45: 7.683\n5. B10: 5.371\n6. A84: 3.676\n7. C35: 4.189\n8. A30: 3.468\n9. B60: 2.494\n10. C92: 1.311\n11. A58: 1.813\n12. B09: 1.762\n13. A66: 1.589\n14. A16: 1.327\n15. A08: 1.429\n16. B94: 1.243\n17. B67: 1.231\n18. B46: 1.488\n19. C81: 1.187\n20. B12: 0.968\n21. B00: 0.913\n22. C15: 0.892\n23. C12: 0.787\n24. B85: 0.475\n25. A23: 0.339\n26. C24: 0.357\n27. A05: 0.485\n28. B75: 0.452\n29. B69: 0.116\n30. C06: 0.031\n31. B16: 0.005\n\nNow, I can start picking items in this order, adding their efforts and summing until I reach the limit. Let me start adding:\n\nC34: effort 54. Total so far: 54\nA27: 106 → 54+106=160\nC70: 125 → 160+125=285\nB45: 60 → 285+60=345\nB10: 116 → 345+116=461\nA84: 136 → 461+136=597\nC35: 106 → 597+106=703\nA30: 213 → 703+213=916\nB60: 324 → 916+324=1240\nC92: 164 → 1240+164=1404\nA58: 252 → 1404+252=1656\nB09: 446 → 1656+446=2102\nA66: 517 → 2102+517=2619\nA16: 645 → 2619+645=3264\nA08: 607 → 3264+607=3871\nB94: 630 → 3871+630=4501\nB67: 634 → 4501+634=5135\nB46: 407 → 5135+407=5542\nC81: 601 → 5542+601=6143\nB12: 946 → 6143+946=7089 (Oops, that's over the limit. So I can't include B12. Let's see what's next after that.)\n\nWithout B12, the total is 6143, under 8770. But I can try adding more. Next would be B00: 638. Let's add that: 6143 + 638 = 6781. Still under.\n\nNext is C15: 875 → 6781 + 875 = 7656\nThen C12: 849 → 7656 +849=8505. Over limit. Can't do that.\n\nMaybe instead of adding C15, add something else. Let me check. So after B00, total is 6781. Next options are C15:875 or B00 is already added, so maybe C15 can't be added because 6781+875=7656 which is under 8770. Then add more.\n\nWait, after adding B00, total is 6781. Next would be C15: 875 → 6781+875=7656. Then, what's left is 8770 - 7656=1114.\n\nSo after C15, can I add more? Let's see what's next: the next item after C15 is B00, which is already added. Wait, no, in the order, after C15 would be C12, which is 849, but that would put us over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can swap some lower importance per effort items with higher ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after adding up to B46, I have 5542. Then I can add other items that have higher importance per effort.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a step-by-step selection, ensuring I maximize the total importance without exceeding the effort.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try using a greedy approach, picking the highest importance per effort first, but maybe it's not optimal because some combinations could yield higher total.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with the greedy approach for now.\n\nLet me try adding in the order until I hit the limit.\n\nItems in order:\n\n1. C34:54 → total effort:54, importance:484\n2. A27:106 → total:160, imp:822\n3. C70:125 → 285, imp:968\n4. B45:60 →345, imp:461\n5. B10:116 →461, imp:623\n6. A84:136 →597, imp:500\n7. C35:106 →703, imp:444\n8. A30:213 →916, imp:739\n9. B60:324 →1240, imp:808\n10. C92:164 →1404, imp:215\n11. A58:252 →1656, imp:457\n12. B09:446 →2102, imp:786\n13. A66:517 →2619, imp:822\n14. A16:645 →3264, imp:856\n15. A08:607 →3871, imp:868\n16. B94:630 →4501, imp:783\n17. B67:634 →5135, imp:780\n18. B46:407 →5542, imp:606\n19. C81:601 →6143, imp:713\n20. B00:638 →6781, imp:583\n21. C15:875 →7656, imp:781\nRemaining effort:8770-7656=1114\n\nNow, what's left? The next items are:\n\nC12:849 (too big, 7656+849=8505 >8770)\nB12:946 (can't add)\nB85:842 (too big)\nA23:773 (too big)\nB75:520 → 7656+520=8176. Then remaining is 8770-8176=594.\nThen check next items: B16:649 (too big), C24:763 (too big), etc. Wait, maybe pick smaller items.\n\nWait, after adding B75, total effort 8176. Left with 594.\n\nLooking for items not yet added with effort ≤594. Let's see:\n\nB53:382, effort 382, imp:65\nB69:832 (too big)\nA05:801 (too big)\nB12:946 (too big)\nA23:773 (too big)\nC24:763 (too big)\nA30 is already added.\n\nSo, B53:382. Let me check if it's in the remaining items. Wait, have I already added B53? No, I haven't. So adding B53: effort 8176+382=8558, imp 65. Remaining:8770-8558=212.\n\nIs there an item with effort ≤212? Let's check:\n\nLooking through, items not added yet:\n\nLooking at the item list, the remaining items with effort ≤212 are:\n\n- B53:382 (added)\n- A23:773\n- B75:520\n- B10:116 (already added)\n- C34:54 (added)\n- A27:106 (added)\n- B45:60 (added)\n- B09:446 (added)\n- A84:136 (added)\n- C35:106 (added)\n- B60:324 (added)\n- C92:164 (added)\n- A58:252 (added)\n- B16:649\n- C70:125 (added)\nWait, maybe B53 is 382, which I just added, but effort left is 212 after that. Let's see if any other small items are left.\n\nPerhaps B53 is already added. Wait, no, in the order above, B53 hasn't been added yet because I only added up to C15, B00, C15, B75, etc. Wait, no, let me retrace.\n\nWait, in the current selection, after adding up to C15, B00, and B75, the effort is 8176. Then adding B53 would take it to 8176+382=8558. Then, remaining 8770-8558=212. Are there any items not yet selected with effort ≤212?\n\nLooking back, A05:801, C92:164. Wait, C92 is already added, right? In step 10, yes.\n\nWhat about B12:946? No, too big. B69:832, no. B85:842, no. B16:649, no. C24:763, no. A30:213 already added. A05:801. So no, nothing left with effort ≤212. So after adding B53, the total is 8558, with 212 left, but no more items to add. So maybe that's as far as I can go.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can replace some lower importance items with higher ones to fit more in. For example, C34 has a high ratio, but if I remove it and include a larger item, maybe I can get more total importance. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just calculate the total importance so far:\n\nC34:484\nA27:822 → total 1306\nC70:968 → 2274\nB45:461 → 2735\nB10:623 → 3358\nA84:500 → 3858\nC35:444 → 4302\nA30:739 → 5041\nB60:808 → 5849\nC92:215 → 6064\nA58:457 → 6521\nB09:786 → 7307\nA66:822 → 8129\nA16:856 → 8985\nA08:868 → 9853\nB94:783 → 10636\nB67:780 → 11416\nB46:606 → 12022\nC81:713 → 12735\nB00:583 → 13318\nC15:781 → 14099\nB75:235 → 14334\nB53:65 → 14399\n\nWait, but this can't be right because some of these may not fit. Wait, no, the effort was 8176 + 382 = 8558, so I can't have that high an importance. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nActually, I think I got confused. The effort after adding B75 and B53 is 8176 + 382 = 8558, but that's within the limit. So the total importance from these items would be:\n\nC34:484\nA27:822 → 1306\nC70:968 → 2274\nB45:461 → 2735\nB10:623 → 3358\nA84:500 → 3858\nC35:444 → 4302\nA30:739 → 5041\nB60:808 → 5849\nC92:215 → 6064\nA58:457 → 6521\nB09:786 → 7307\nA66:822 → 8129\nA16:856 → 8985\nA08:868 → 9853\nB94:783 → 10636\nB67:780 → 11416\nB46:606 → 12022\nC81:713 → 12735\nB00:583 → 13318\nC15:781 → 14099\nB75:235 → 14334\nB53:65 → 14399\n\nBut the effort is only 8558. Wait, 14399 seems high, but I'm probably double-counting or something. Wait, no, I think I'm listing all the items added, each step adding their importance. But I think I'm actually not considering that adding each item adds to both effort and importance.\n\nBut actually, the effort is correctly summed, and the total is 8558. The total importance is 14399, which seems really high. I think I might have made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total importance step by step:\n\n1. C34:484 → total imp:484\n2. A27:822 → 484+822=1306\n3. C70:968 → 1306+968=2274\n4. B45:461 → 2274+461=2735\n5. B10:623 → 2735+623=3358\n6. A84:500 → 3358+500=3858\n7. C35:444 → 3858+444=4302\n8. A30:739 → 4302+739=5041\n9. B60:808 → 5041+808=5849\n10. C92:215 → 5849+215=6064\n11. A58:457 → 6064+457=6521\n12. B09:786 → 6521+786=7307\n13. A66:822 → 7307+822=8129\n14. A16:856 → 8129+856=8985\n15. A08:868 → 8985+868=9853\n16. B94:783 → 9853+783=10636\n17. B67:780 → 10636+780=11416\n18. B46:606 → 11416+606=12022\n19. C81:713 → 12022+713=12735\n20. B00:583 → 12735+583=13318\n21. C15:781 → 13318+781=14099\n22. B75:235 → 14099+235=14334\n23. B53:65 → 14334+65=14399\n\nSo total effort is 8558, which is within 8770. The total importance is 14399, which is quite high. But wait, 8558 is way below 8770, so maybe I can add more items.\n\nCheck if there are any items left that haven't been added and have effort less than or equal to 8770 - 8558 = 212.\n\nLooking through, the remaining items are:\n\n- B53:382 (already added)\n- B69:832 → too big\n- A05:801 → too big\n- B12:946 → too big\n- A23:773 → too big\n- C24:763 → too big\n- B85:842 → too big\n- B16:649 → too big\n- C06:980 → too big\n- B12:946 → already checked\n- C12:849 → too big\n- B85:842 → too big\n- C15:875 → already added\n- B09:446 → already added\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some small items. Let me list all items and see which are not added yet:\n\nLooking back:\n\nFrom the initial list, have I added all? Let's check:\n\nTotal items selected so far:23. Total items are 31, so 8 left.\n\nThe remaining items are:\n\nB69, A05, B12, A23, C24, B85, B16, C06.\n\nTheir efforts:\n\nB69:832\nA05:801\nB12:946\nA23:773\nC24:763\nB85:842\nB16:649\nC06:980\n\nAll of these have effort exceeding the remaining 8770 - 8558 = 212, except perhaps none. So I can't add any more items.\n\nTherefore, the total proposal would include all these 23 items, totaling effort 8558, and importance 14399. That seems good, but I need to check if I picked the highest possible.\n\nWait, but B53:382 was added, and it's in the lower importance per effort items. Maybe I should have skipped some lower items to include higher ones. For example, perhaps replace B53 with a higher importance item that uses the remaining effort.\n\nWait, if I don't add B53 (effort 382, imp 65), and instead use the remaining effort for items with higher importance per effort, can I get a better total?\n\nLet me recalculate without B53. After adding B75, effort is 8176, imp 14334 - 65 = 14269.\n\nRemaining effort:8770 -8176=594.\n\nLooking for items not yet added with effort ≤594. From the remaining items, none except maybe B53, which we are considering not adding.\n\nWait, perhaps I can add B53, but it's better to see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can replace some lower importance items with higher ones. Let me see.\n\nFor example, adding B12: effort 946, but that would require removing items whose total effort is 946. But that's too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace B53 (effort 382, imp 65) with B69 (effort 832, imp 97). But 832 is more than 594, so can't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace some items with lower importance to make room for higher ones. For example, C15:781 importance, effort 875. If I remove C15 (effort 875, imp 781), I can add other items with higher importance.\n\nLet me try that. Suppose I remove C15:875 from the previous list. Then effort would be 7656 -875=6781 + B75:520 =7301. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try a different approach: create a set that includes high-importance items and see if their total effort is under 8770.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can include B12, which has high importance (915 for me) but high effort 946. If I include B12, I have to exclude other items whose total effort is 8770 -946=7824.\n\nLooking at the previous selection without B12: total effort 8558, so if I remove some items to make room for B12.\n\nFor example, remove B53 (382), and C15 (875), which frees up 1257 effort, allowing addition of B12 (946). So effort becomes 8558 -382 -875 +946= 8558 -1257 +946= 8558 - 1257 is 7301 +946=8247, which is under 8770, and add B12's importance 915.\n\nSo total importance:14399 -65 (B53) -781 (C15) +915 (B12) =14399 -846 +915=14399 +69=14468.\n\nThis seems better. So the new set would include B12 instead of B53 and C15.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the total effort is 8247, which is still under 8770, and perhaps I can add more items.\n\nWait, 8770 -8247=523. Is there an item with effort ≤523? Let me check the remaining items not added:\n\nAfter removing B53 and C15, and adding B12, the remaining items to possibly add could be B46 (effort 407, importance 606), B09 (446, 786), etc., but wait, have I already added those?\n\nWait, in the original list, B46 was added, as well as B09. So they are already included. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. I think the initial selection is a good starting point, but I might want to optimize by swapping lower importance items for higher ones where possible.\n\nBut given time constraints, I think the initial proposal is acceptable. So I'll proceed to propose this set.\n"

They mentioned that in the previous attempt, I missed including the ARGUMENT format. So, I need to make sure I don't make that mistake again.\n\nFirst, I should start with the STRATEGIC REASONING section. This is where I can outline my thought process as if I'm thinking aloud. It's hidden from the other player, so I can be candid about my strategy. I'll explain how I calculated the importance per effort ratio to prioritize items that give me the most value without exceeding the effort limit. Maybe I'll also mention considering swaps to optimize the set and ensuring that the proposal is as strong as possible.\n\nNext, I need to present a PROPOSAL. This should be a set of items that I believe maximize my importance while staying within the 8770 effort limit. I'll list the items I've selected based on their ratios and ensuring the total effort doesn't exceed the limit. I should double-check the effort totals to make sure I'm within the allowed range.\n\nThen, I must include an ARGUMENT to defend my proposal. This is where I can reason why this particular set is beneficial. I'll highlight high-importance items like A08, B94, and B67, emphasizing their value to me. I'll also point out that including lower-effort items allows me to maximize the number of high-importance items, which strengthens the proposal.\n\nI should be careful to follow the structure correctly. Each tag like STRATEGIC REASONING, PROPOSAL, and ARGUMENT should be followed by a colon and then a Python set or string. No extra text, just the structured format.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm not revealing my hidden importance scores, so I should focus on the effort and the process rather than the specific importance values. The argument should be persuasive but not give away sensitive information.\n\nFinally, I'll review everything to make sure all the required sections are included and properly formatted.

The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.

First, I should check if their proposed set is within the effort limit. The LIMIT is 8770.\n\nI'll go through each item they included and sum up the efforts.

That's way over the limit. But this can't be right because they proposed it, so perhaps I made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the items. Let me list them all and sum again more carefully.\n\nList of items and their efforts:\n\n1. A27:106\n2. A30:213 → total 319\n3. A84:136 → 455\n4. A05:801 → 1256\n5. A23:773 → 2029\n6. A16:645 → 2674\n7. A66:517 → 3191\n8. A08:607 → 3798\n9. B00:638 → 4436\n10. B21:830 → 5266\n11. B45:60 → 5326\n12. B53:382 → 5708\n13. B60:324 → 6032\n14. B67:634 → 6666\n15. B94:630 → 7296\n16. B09:446 → 7742\n17. B10:116 → 7858\n18. B46:407 → 8265\n19. B75:520 → 8785\n20. C15:875 → 9660 (This alone exceeds 8770)\n\nWait, but 8785 is already over 8770, so adding C15's 875 would make it 8785 + 875 = 9660, which is way over. That can't be right because the other player wouldn't propose something over the limit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if I included all the items correctly. Wait, perhaps the other player's list includes 24 items, but perhaps some are not in the data? Let me check the item list provided.\n\nLooking back, all the items in the proposal are present in the given data, so that's correct. So the sum according to my calculation is 9660, which is over the limit. But that can't be possible because the other player's proposal should be valid. So I must have added wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try a different approach: I'll use a calculator step by step.\n\nLet me list all the efforts again:\n\nA27:106  \nA30:213  \nA84:136  \nA05:801  \nA23:773  \nA16:645  \nA66:517  \nA08:607  \nB00:638  \nB21:830  \nB45:60  \nB53:382  \nB60:324  \nB67:634  \nB94:630  \nB09:446  \nB10:116  \nB46:407  \nB75:520  \nC15:875  \nC34:54  \nC35:106  \nC70:125  \nC92:164  \nC24:763\n\nWait, I think I missed that the proposal includes C24:763. So let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the items in the proposal and sum their efforts.\n\nHere's the list, I'll go one by one:\n\n1. A27:106 → Total:106\n2. A30:213 → 106+213=319\n3. A84:136 → 319+136=455\n4. A05:801 → 455+801=1256\n5. A23:773 → 1256+773=2029\n6. A16:645 → 2029+645=2674\n7. A66:517 → 2674+517=3191\n8. A08:607 → 3191+607=3798\n9. B00:638 → 3798+638=4436\n10. B21:830 → 4436+830=5266\n11. B45:60 → 5266+60=5326\n12. B53:382 → 5326+382=5708\n13. B60:324 → 5708+324=6032\n14. B67:634 → 6032+634=6666\n15. B94:630 → 6666+630=7296\n16. B09:446 → 7296+446=7742\n17. B10:116 → 7742+116=7858\n18. B46:407 → 7858+407=8265\n19. B75:520 → 8265+520=8785\n20. C15:875 → 8785+875=9660 (Over the limit)\n21. C34:54 → 9660+54=9714\n22. C35:106 → 9714+106=9820\n23. C70:125 → 9820+125=9945\n24. C92:164 → 9945+164=10109\n25. C24:763 → 10109+763=10872\n\nWait, that can't be right. The total effort is way over 8770. But the proposal was made, so maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check each item's effort.\n\nWait, let me cross-verify each item:\n\n- A27:106 (correct)\n- A30:213 (yes)\n- A84:136 (yes)\n- A05:801 (yes)\n- A23:773 (yes)\n- A16:645 (yes)\n- A66:517 (yes)\n- A08:607 (yes)\n- B00:638 (yes)\n- B21:830 (yes)\n- B45:60 (yes)\n- B53:382 (yes)\n- B60:324 (yes)\n- B67:634 (yes)\n- B94:630 (yes)\n- B09:446 (yes)\n- B10:116 (yes)\n- B46:407 (yes)\n- B75:520 (yes)\n- C15:875 (yes)\n- C34:54 (yes)\n- C35:106 (yes)\n- C70:125 (yes)\n- C92:164 (yes)\n- C24:763 (yes)\n\nAll correct. So sum is indeed 10872, which is way over the limit. Therefore, the proposal is invalid. But that can't be because the other player wouldn't propose something invalid. Wait, perhaps I missed that the proposal includes 24 items, but in my calculation, it's 25. Wait, the PROPOSAL list had 24 items:\n\nCounting the items in the PROPOSAL: {'A27', 'A30', 'A84', 'A05', 'A23', 'A16', 'A66', 'A08', 'B00', 'B21', 'B45', 'B53', 'B60', 'B67', 'B94', 'B09', 'B10', 'B46', 'B75', 'C15', 'C34', 'C35', 'C70', 'C92', 'C24'}\n\nWait, that's 24 items. So 24 items. Let me recount efforts for exactly 24 items.\n\nWait in my previous calculation, I went up to C24 as the 25th, but that can't be. Let me recount correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I included an extra item. Let me list them:\n\n1. A27:106\n2. A30:213 → 319\n3. A84:136 → 455\n4. A05:801 → 1256\n5. A23:773 → 2029\n6. A16:645 → 2674\n7. A66:517 → 3191\n8. A08:607 → 3798\n9. B00:638 → 4436\n10. B21:830 → 5266\n11. B45:60 → 5326\n12. B53:382 → 5708\n13. B60:324 → 6032\n14. B67:634 → 6666\n15. B94:630 → 7296\n16. B09:446 → 7742\n17. B10:116 → 7858\n18. B46:407 → 8265\n19. B75:520 → 8785\n20. C15:875 → 9660\n21. C34:54 → 9714\n22. C35:106 → 9820\n23. C70:125 → 9945\n24. C92:164 → 10109\n25. C24:763 → 10872\n\nWait, that's 25 items, but the proposal only includes 24. Wait no, maybe C24 is included as the 24th. Let me check: the proposal is up to 'C92', then 'C24' is the 24th? Hmm, wait no. Let me count again.\n\nWait, the proposal list as written is 24 items:\n\n1. A27\n2. A30\n3. A84\n4. A05\n5. A23\n6. A16\n7. A66\n8. A08\n9. B00\n10. B21\n11. B45\n12. B53\n13. B60\n14. B67\n15. B94\n16. B09\n17. B10\n18. B46\n19. B75\n20. C15\n21. C34\n22. C35\n23. C70\n24. C92\n25. C24 → Oh, wait, no, the 25th would be C24, but the proposal is 24 items. So perhaps the last one is C24, making it 24 items. So perhaps I added one extra, C92 and C24.\n\nWait, let me recount the list as per the proposal:\n\nThe proposal is: {'A27', 'A30', 'A84', 'A05', 'A23', 'A16', 'A66', 'A08', 'B00', 'B21', 'B45', 'B53', 'B60', 'B67', 'B94', 'B09', 'B10', 'B46', 'B75', 'C15', 'C34', 'C35', 'C70', 'C92', 'C24'}\n\nCounting each comma-separated item: 24 items. So the effort sum should be for 24 items. So let me only add the first 24, excluding C24?\n\nWait no, because the way it's written, the list includes 24 items, including C24. So perhaps I included 24 items correctly.\n\nWait, let me list the 24 items and their efforts:\n\n1. A27:106 → 106\n2. A30:213 → 319\n3. A84:136 → 455\n4. A05:801 → 1256\n5. A23:773 → 2029\n6. A16:645 → 2674\n7. A66:517 → 3191\n8. A08:607 → 3798\n9. B00:638 → 4436\n10. B21:830 → 5266\n11. B45:60 → 5326\n12. B53:382 → 5708\n13. B60:324 → 6032\n14. B67:634 → 6666\n15. B94:630 → 7296\n16. B09:446 → 7742\n17. B10:116 → 7858\n18. B46:407 → 8265\n19. B75:520 → 8785\n20. C15:875 → 8785+875=9660\n21. C34:54 → 9660+54=9714\n22. C35:106 → 9714+106=9820\n23. C70:125 → 9820+125=9945\n24. C92:164 → 9945+164=10109\n\nSo total is 10109, which is way over 8770. That can't be, so the proposal is invalid. But that's impossible, as the other player wouldn't make an invalid proposal. Therefore, I must have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the efforts. Let me cross-check each item's effort from the data given:\n\nItem effort = {\"B21\": 830, \"B00\": 638, \"A08\": 607, \"A27\": 106, \"B94\": 630, \"B53\": 382, \"A23\": 773, \"C65\": 455, \"A89\": 262, \"B67\": 634, \"B45\": 60, \"C34\": 54, \"C12\": 849, \"A05\": 801, \"B60\": 324, \"C92\": 164, \"B69\": 832, \"A84\": 136, \"C06\": 980, \"B12\": 946, \"A16\": 645, \"B85\": 842, \"C35\": 106, \"B10\": 116, \"C15\": 875, \"B09\": 446, \"B16\": 649, \"C81\": 601, \"A58\": 252, \"C24\": 763, \"A30\": 213, \"A66\": 517, \"B75\": 520, \"B46\": 407, \"C70\": 125}\n\nSo checking each one as per their effort:\n\n1.

C92:164 ✔️\n\nWait, no C24:763 is not included in the proposal, so I was mistakenly adding it. The proposal includes up to C92, which is 24 items. So the correct sum is up to C92:164.\n\nSo total effort would be up to 24 items:\n\n1. A27:106 → 106\n2. A30:213 → 319\n3. A84:136 → 455\n4. A05:801 → 1256\n5. A23:773 → 2029\n6. A16:645 → 2674\n7. A66:517 → 3191\n8. A08:607 → 3798\n9. B00:638 → 4436\n10. B21:830 → 5266\n11. B45:60 → 5326\n12. B53:382 → 5708\n13. B60:324 → 6032\n14. B67:634 → 6666\n15. B94:630 → 7296\n16. B09:446 → 7742\n17. B10:116 → 7858\n18. B46:407 → 8265\n19. B75:520 → 8785\n20. C15:875 → 9660 (already over)\n21. C34:54 → 9714\n22. C35:106 → 9820\n23. C70:125 → 9945\n24. C92:164 → 10109\n\nStill way over. But the other player's proposal is invalid, which can't be. So perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe they made a mistake, which is possible in the game.\n\nGiven that, I need to respond. Since the proposal is invalid, perhaps I should REFUSE it, pointing out that it exceeds the effort limit. But wait, the rules say that a PROPOSAL must be within LIMIT, so maybe the other player made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed as if it's within the limit, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, in the rules, it's stated that any PROPOSAL must have total effort ≤ LIMIT. So if their proposal exceeds, I can REFUSE it, pointing that out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate again to make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum. Let me use a different approach: group the efforts and sum.\n\nLet me list the efforts in order and sum step by step, grouping similar categories:\n\nFrom A's:\n\nA27:106  \nA30:213  \nA84:136  \nA05:801  \nA23:773  \nA16:645  \nA66:517  \nA08:607  \nA23:773 is already counted.\n\nWait, A's:\n\nA27:106  \nA30:213  \nA84:136  \nA05:801  \nA23:773  \nA16:645  \nA66:517  \nA08:607  \nTotal A's: 106+213=319, +136=455, +801=1256, +773=2029, +645=2674, +517=3191, +607=3798.\n\nB's:\n\nB00:638  \nB21:830  \nB45:60  \nB53:382  \nB60:324  \nB67:634  \nB94:630  \nB09:446  \nB10:116  \nB46:407  \nB75:520  \nSum B's:\n\n638+830=1468  \n+60=1528  \n+382=1910  \n+324=2234  \n+634=2868  \n+630=3498  \n+446=3944  \n+116=4060  \n+407=4467  \n+520=4987.\n\nC's:\n\nC15:875  \nC34:54  \nC35:106  \nC70:125  \nC92:164  \nSum C's:\n\n875+54=929  \n+106=1035  \n+125=1160  \n+164=1324.\n\nNow total A's:3798, B's:4987, C's:1324.\n\nTotal effort: 3798 + 4987 = 8785; 8785 + 1324 = 10109.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So it's indeed over.\n\nSo the other player's proposal is invalid, which can't be, as per rules, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the other player included C24:763, making it 25 items, but that's more over. Alternatively, perhaps they didn't include C24.\n\nWait, the proposal was {'A27', 'A30', 'A84', 'A05', 'A23', 'A16', 'A66', 'A08', 'B00', 'B21', 'B45', 'B53', 'B60', 'B67', 'B94', 'B09', 'B10', 'B46', 'B75', 'C15', 'C34', 'C35', 'C70', 'C92', 'C24'}\n\nSo it's 24 items including C24. So perhaps I need to recalculate including C24:763 as the 24th item.\n\nSo, the sum would be:\n\nA's:3798  \nB's:4987  \nC's:1324  \nPlus C24:763 → C's total:1324+763=2087.\n\nTotal effort: 3798 + 4987 = 8785 + 2087 = 10872.\n\nThat's way over. So the proposal is invalid, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have misread the items.\n\nWait, perhaps the other player made a mistake in their proposal. But I need to respond.\n\nGiven that, my options are:\n\n1. REFUSE the proposal because it's over the limit.\n2. Propose a different set that is within the limit and benefits me more.\n3. Agree to it if it's within the limit, but it's not.\n\nSince it's over, I have to REFUSE it.\n\nBut perhaps I should point out that their proposal exceeds the effort limit. Alternatively, maybe I should just REFUSE without explaining, but the rules say I must include at least one ARGUMENT in all messages.\n\nWait, the rules state that I must include the ARGUMENT format at least once in all messages. So in my response, I must include an ARGUMENT.\n\nSo, possible plan:\n\n1. REFUSE the other player's proposal due to exceeding the effort limit.\n2. Provide an ARGUMENT explaining that their proposal is invalid and why.\n3. Perhaps include a STRATEGIC REASONING explaining my thought process.\n\nWait, but the other player's proposal is invalid, which is a strong reason to refuse. So perhaps I can respond with a REFUSE and an ARGUMENT stating that the total effort exceeds the limit.\n\nMoreover, I need to make a STRATEGIC REASONING at the beginning of the message, hidden from the other player. So myStencil would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'I need to evaluate the other player's proposal. Upon calculating, I found that the total effort exceeds 8770, making it invalid. Therefore, I should REFUSE the proposal and consider making a counter-proposal that maximizes my own importance while staying within the limit. I must ensure that my proposal includes high-importance items for me without exceeding the effort capacity.'}\n\nThen, in the message, I can include:\n\nREFUSE: {their proposal}\n\nARGUMENT: {'The total effort of your proposal exceeds the shared limit of 8770, making it invalid.'}\n\nBut wait, the other player's proposal is invalid, so I can REFUSE it and perhaps make a counter-proposal. Alternatively, I can just REFUSE without making a proposal yet.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to REFUSE and make a counter-proposal to keep the negotiation moving.\n\nWait, but the rules say that when I make a Proposal, I can't reveal my hidden importance. So I need to choose items that I value highly but perhaps the other player doesn't, thereby maximizing my total importance while keeping effort under the limit.\n\nLooking back at my importance scores, I need to prioritize items that are high in importance to me but low in effort, or at least combine in a way that the total effort is under 8770.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take their proposal and remove some high-effort items to bring it under the limit. For instance, their proposal includes C15:875, which is a big effort item. Removing that alone would subtract 875 from their total. Their total was 10872, so 10872 - 875 = 9997, which is still over. So that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can suggest removing multiple high-effort items.\n\nBut it might be too time-consuming to adjust their proposal. So maybe it's better to create my own proposal.\n\nI think the best approach is to REFUSE their proposal because it's invalid and then make a PROPOSAL of my own that includes items that matter most to me and fits within the effort limit.\n\nSo, first, in my response:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'The other player's proposal exceeds the effort limit, so I need to REFUSE it. I should then create a new proposal that includes items with high importance to me, ensuring the total effort is within 8770. I'll prioritize items where my importance is high and their effort is manageable, aiming to maximize my total importance without exceeding the limit.'}\n\nThen, in the message:\n\nREFUSE: {'A27', 'A30', 'A84', 'A05', 'A23', 'A16', 'A66', 'A08', 'B00', 'B21', 'B45', 'B53', 'B60', 'B67', 'B94', 'B09', 'B10', 'B46', 'B75', 'C15', 'C34', 'C35', 'C70', 'C92', 'C24'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'The total effort of your proposal exceeds the shared limit of 8770, making it invalid. We need to find a set of items that stays within the limit.'}\n\nThen, I'll make a PROPOSAL of my own.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to just REFUSE and make a PROPOSAL in the same message. Let me structure it accordingly.\n"

            "reasoning": "Alright, so the user has just responded to my previous message, and I need to figure out how to proceed in this negotiation game. Let me try to break down what's happening here.\n\nFirst, I look back at my previous move. I proposed a set of items, but the user's response seems to indicate that there was a formatting error. They mentioned that my message contained an untagged sequence or that I used STRATEGIC REASONING more than once, which is against the rules. That's a problem because I have to follow the interaction protocol strictly.\n\nI remember that in my previous message, I included STRATEGIC REASONING, then REFUSE, ARGUMENT, another STRATEGIC REASONING, PROPOSAL, and ARGUMENT. Oh, wait, that's the mistake. I used STRATEGIC REASONING twice, once at the very beginning and then again later. The rules state that I should only include STRATEGIC REASONING once at the very beginning of each message, and it shouldn't be repeated. So the user is pointing out that I made that mistake, which might have confused the system or broken the protocol.\n\nI need to correct this. My goal is to make sure that my next message follows the structure correctly. So, in my next response, I should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by the necessary tags like PROPOSAL or REFUSE, and make sure each argument is within the specified tags.\n\nLooking at the game state, the other player proposed a set that exceeded the effort limit, so I refused it. Then, I tried to propose a new set, but perhaps the effort was still over, or the formatting was incorrect. I need to ensure that any proposal I make stays within the 8770 limit.\n\nTo do that, I should recalculate the total effort of the items in my proposed set. Let's list out the items and their efforts again:\n\nA08: 607  \nB00: 638  \nB21: 830  \nB45: 60  \nB53: 382  \nB67: 634  \nB94: 630  \nC70: 125  \nA27: 106  \nA30: 213  \nA84: 136  \nA05: 801  \nA23: 773  \nA16: 645  \nA66: 517  \nB09: 446  \nB10: 116  \nB46: 407  \nB75: 520  \nC15: 875  \nC34: 54  \nC35: 106  \n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n607 + 638 = 1245  \n1245 + 830 = 2075  \n2075 + 60 = 2135  \n2135 + 382 = 2517  \n2517 + 634 = 3151  \n3151 + 630 = 3781  \n3781 + 125 = 3906  \n3906 + 106 = 4012  \n4012 + 213 = 4225  \n4225 + 136 = 4361  \n4361 + 801 = 5162  \n5162 + 773 = 5935  \n5935 + 645 = 6580  \n6580 + 517 = 7097  \n7097 + 446 = 7543  \n7543 + 116 = 7659  \n7659 + 407 = 8066  \n8066 + 520 = 8586  \n8586 + 875 = 9461  \n9461 + 54 = 9515  \n9515 + 106 = 9621  \n\nWait, that's way over the limit of 8770. No wonder the user is having issues. My proposed set exceeds the effort limit by a significant margin.\n\nThat's a big mistake on my part. I need to correct this immediately. I should go back and select items more carefully, prioritizing those that give me the highest importance per unit of effort, ensuring that the total effort stays within 8770.\n\nI need to adjust my strategy. Maybe I can find a subset of the items I proposed that brings the total effort down. Let's prioritize the items where my importance is the highest relative to their effort.\n\nLooking back at my importance values:\n\nA08: 868 is high  \nB67: 780  \nB94: 783  \nB00: 583  \nA16: 856  \nC70: 968  \nA27: 822  \nA30: 739  \nC15: 781  \n\nThese are all high-importance items. Now, I need to see which combination of these, along with some lower-effort items, can fit within the limit.\n\nPerhaps I can remove the higher-effort items like A05 (801 effort) and A23 (773), which are contributing significantly to the total. Let me try excluding those and see.\n\nSo, if I exclude A05 (801) and A23 (773), that removes a big chunk of effort. Let's recalculate:\n\nTotal effort without A05 and A23: 9621 - 801 - 773 = 8047. Still over.\n\nHmm, still too high. Maybe I can drop more items. What if I remove C15 (875) and C35 (106)? That would reduce by 875 + 106 = 981, bringing the total to 8047 - 981 = 7566. That's under the limit, but I lost C15 which has high importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can remove B75 (520) and B46 (407), which are 927 together. 8047 - 927 = 7120. That's way under. Maybe too much.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider starting over. Select the highest importance items first and see how much effort they take.\n\nStarting with A08 (868 imp, 607), B67 (780,634), B94 (783,630), C70 (968,125), B00 (583,638), A16 (856,645), A27 (822,106), B21 (138,830), B45 (461,60).\n\nLet me add their efforts:\n\n607 + 634 = 1241  \n1241 + 630 = 1871  \n1871 + 125 = 1996  \n1996 + 638 = 2634  \n2634 + 645 = 3279  \n3279 + 106 = 3385  \n3385 + 830 = 4215  \n4215 + 60 = 4275  \n\nTotal so far: 4275. That's way under. Now, let's see if we can add more items without exceeding 8770.\n\nFrom my importance list, the next highest are:\n\nC15 (781,875)  \nA30 (739,213)  \nB10 (623,116)  \nC35 (444,106)  \nB09 (786,446)  \nA84 (500,136)  \nC92 (215,164)  \nA05 (389,801)  \nB60 (808,324)  \nA23 (262,773)  \nC24 (273,763)  \nB85 (400,842)  \nA58 (457,252)  \nB75 (235,520)  \nB46 (606,407)  \nC34 (484,54)  \nB53 (65,382)  \nB69 (97,832)  \nC06 (30,980)  \nB12 (915,946)  \n\nWait, I've already included B21, but in the initial list, it's 830. Let me proceed carefully.\n\nLooking at the next items to add, perhaps C15 is too high in effort (875). Maybe instead, pick lower-effort items.\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA30 (213) is a good candidate. Effort 213.\n\nAdding A30: 4275 + 213 = 4488.\n\nNext, B10 (116) adds up to 4488 + 116 = 4604.\n\nC35 (106): 4604 + 106 = 4710.\n\nB09 (446): 4710 + 446 = 5156.\n\nA84 (136): 5156 + 136 = 5292.\n\nC92 (164): 5292 + 164 = 5456.\n\nB60 (324): 5456 + 324 = 5780.\n\nA23 (773 is too high, and effort is 773. Adding that would push us to 5780 +773=6553. Under 8770, but let me see if that's a good move.\n\nWait, adding A23 gives us +262 importance but takes up 773 effort. Alternatively, is there a better combination?\n\nAlternatively, let's try adding B60 (324): total effort 5780.\n\nNext, perhaps A05 (801 effort, importance 389). That's a lot of effort. Maybe not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, B75 (520) would bring effort to 5780 +520=6300. Then, perhaps B46 (407) brings it to 6300 +407=6707. Then, adding C24 (763) is too much because 6707 +763=7470, which is under. But C24 has importance 273, which is not too high.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can add multiple smaller effort items.\n\nFrom 5780, what else can I add?\n\nLooking at remaining items:\n\nC34 (54), which is very low effort. Add that: 5780 +54=5834. Importance +484.\n\nA58 (252): 5834 +252=6086.\n\nB53 (382): 6086 +382=6468. Importance only 65, but perhaps necessary for effort.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the remaining effort: 8770 - 5780=2990. So, we can add items with up to 2990 effort in total.\n\nBut going back, maybe including A05 (801) is necessary for higher importance, but let's calculate.\n\nIf I add A05 (801): 5780 +801=6581.\n\nLeftover effort:8770-6581=2189.\n\nThen, what else can I include?\n\nB85 (842): 842 is too big for 2189. 842 leaves 1347.\n\nThen, perhaps C15 (875) is still too big.\n\nAlternatively, let's see other items.\n\nB09 (446): adding that would bring to 6581 +446=7027. Leftover: 8770-7027=1743.\n\nThen, perhaps B46 (407): 7027 +407=7434. Leftover: 1336.\n\nB75 (520): 7434 +520=7954. Leftover: 8770 -7954=816.\n\nA84 (136): adding that gives 7954 +136=8090. Leftover: 680.\n\nHmm, but A84 has importance 500, which is good. So, total effort now 8090.\n\nAlternatively, maybe add B10 (116) and B46 (407), etc. But this might get complicated.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe a better approach is to consider a step-by-step selection, focusing on items with the highest importance per unit of effort.\n\nLet me calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item where I have high importance.\n\nA08:868/607≈1.43  \nB67:780/634≈1.23  \nB94:783/630≈1.24  \nC70:968/125≈7.74  \nB00:583/638≈0.91  \nA16:856/645≈1.33  \nA27:822/106≈7.75  \nB21:138/830≈0.166  \nB45:461/60≈7.68  \nB53:65/382≈0.17  \nA30:739/213≈3.47  \nA84:500/136≈3.68  \nC15:781/875≈0.89  \nA05:389/801≈0.485  \nB60:808/324≈2.49  \nC92:215/164≈1.31  \nB69:97/832≈0.116  \nB09:786/446≈1.76  \nB10:623/116≈5.37  \nC35:444/106≈4.19  \nC24:273/763≈0.358  \nA58:457/252≈1.81  \nB75:235/520≈0.452  \nB46:606/407≈1.49  \nC34:484/54≈8.96  \nB85:400/842≈0.475  \nA23:262/773≈0.339  \nC06:30/980≈0.031  \nB12:915/946≈0.967  \nA66:822/517≈1.59  \nB75:235/520≈0.452  \n\nWow, okay, so the highest ratios are C70 and A27, both over 7. Then B45 and C34 with around 7.68 and 8.96 respectively. Then B10 at 5.37, C35 at 4.19, etc.\n\nSo, I should prioritize these high ratios first.\n\nStart by selecting:\n\nA27 (106 effort, importance 822)  \nC70 (125, 968)  \nB45 (60, 461)  \nC34 (54, 484)  \nB10 (116,623)\n\nTotal effort so far:106+125=231; +60=291; +54=345; +116=461.\n\nNow, cumulative effort:461.\n\nImportance:822+968+461+484+623= 822+968=1790; +461=2251; +484=2735; +623=3358.\n\nNext, add A30 (213,739): effort=213, total effort=461+213=674. Importance=3358+739=4097.\n\nNext, A84 (136,500): effort=136, total=674+136=810. Importance=4097+500=4597.\n\nNext, B09 (446,786): effort=446, total=810+446=1256. Importance=4597+786=5383.\n\nNow, remaining effort:8770-1256=7514.\n\nNext, B67 (634,780): adding this would bring effort to 1256+634=1890. Importance=5383+780=6163.\n\nRemaining effort:8770-1890=6880.\n\nNext, B94 (630,783): effort=630, total=1890+630=2520. Importance=6163+783=6946.\n\nRemaining:8770-2520=6250.\n\nNext, A08 (607,868): effort=607, total=2520+607=3127. Importance=6946+868=7814.\n\nRemaining:8770-3127=5643.\n\nNext, A16 (645,856): effort=645, total=3127+645=3772. Importance=7814+856=8670.\n\nRemaining:8770-3772=5000-? Wait, 8770-3772=4998.\n\nNext, B60 (324,808): add it. Effort=324, total=3772+324=4096. Importance=8670+808=9478.\n\nRemaining:8770-4096=4674.\n\nNext, let's take C15 (875,781): adding that would go to 4096+875=4971. Importance=9478+781=10259.\n\nRemaining:8770-4971=3799.\n\nWait, 8770-4971=3799? Let me check: 4096+875=4971. 8770-4971=3799.\n\nNow, check if we can add more. Let's look for next high importance per effort ratio.\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nB00:583/638≈0.91  \nA05:389/801≈0.485  \nB21:138/830≈0.166  \nB53:65/382≈0.17  \nA23:262/773≈0.339  \nB75:235/520≈0.452  \nB46:606/407≈1.49  \nC24:273/763≈0.358  \nA58:457/252≈1.81  \nB85:400/842≈0.475  \nC92:215/164≈1.31  \nB69:97/832≈0.116  \nB12:915/946≈0.967  \nA66:822/517≈1.59  \nB75: same as above  \nC35:444/106≈4.19, but I think I've already included some of these.\n\nWait, have I included C35? Let me check my current set: A27, C70, B45, C34, B10, A30, A84, B09, B67, B94, A08, A16, B60, C15.\n\nC35 is not included yet. It's effort 106, importance 444.\n\nSo, add C35 (106): effort=106, total=4971+106=5077. Importance=10259+444=10703.\n\nRemaining effort:8770-5077=3693.\n\nNext, B46 (407,606): effort=407. Adding that: 5077+407=5484. Importance=10703+606=11309.\n\nRemaining:8770-5484=3286.\n\nNext, A66 (517,822): effort=517. Adding that:5484+517=6001. Importance=11309+822=12131.\n\nRemaining:8770-6001=2769.\n\nNext, A58 (252,457): effort=252. Total=6001+252=6253. Importance=12131+457=12588.\n\nRemaining:8770-6253=2517.\n\nNext, C92 (164,215): add it. Effort=164, total=6253+164=6417. Importance=12588+215=12803.\n\nRemaining:8770-6417=2353.\n\nNext, B46 has been added already, so next could be B85 (842,400). Effort is 842, which is larger than remaining 2353. Can't add.\n\nInstead, check other items.\n\nB75 (520,235): adding that would use 520, leaving 2353-520=1833. Importance=12803+235=13038.\n\nRemaining:1833.\n\nNext, B09 is already added. B53 is low, but effort=382. Let's add B53 (382,65). Effort=382, total=6417+382=6799. Wait, 6253+164=6417, then adding B75:520 makes 6417+520=6937, then B53 would make 6937+382=7319. Hmm, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list all added items and see how much effort is used.\n\nWait, this process is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I need a more efficient way. Alternatively, perhaps I can take the list up to a certain point and check.\n\nBut I realize I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe I should look for a way to include as many high-importance items as possible without exceeding the effort.\n\nLooking back, my initial proposal was way over the effort limit, and the user caught that. So, I need to make a new proposal that is within the limit. My goal is to maximize my own importance, while the opponent is trying to do the same.\n\nI might also need to consider that the opponent's initial proposal was refused because it was over the limit, so they might now be looking for a more optimized set. I need to find a set that not only gets me the highest possible importance but also is likely to be accepted by them, perhaps by including some items they value highly.\n\nBut since I don't know their importance values, it's tricky. My best bet is to maximize my own, ensuring the total effort is within limit.\n\nSo, to simplify, I'll create a new proposal that includes the highest priority items, making sure the total effort is ≤8770.\n\nBased on the above, selecting items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio seems the best approach.\n\nSo, the new proposed set would include:\n\nA27, C70, B45, C34, B10, A30, A84, B09, B67, B94, A08, A16, B60, C15, C35, B46, A66, A58, C92, and perhaps some others if the effort allows.\n\nCalculating the exact total effort is time-consuming, but the previous attempt showed that it was over. So, perhaps I need to exclude some of the higher effort items like A16 (645) or C15 (875).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can include C15 but exclude A16 to lower the effort.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to list all the items with their effort and cumulative total:\n\n1. A27:106 (Total:106)\n2. C70:125 (231)\n3. B45:60 (291)\n4. C34:54 (345)\n5. B10:116 (461)\n6. A30:213 (674)\n7. A84:136 (810)\n8. B09:446 (1256)\n9. B67:634 (1890)\n10. B94:630 (2520)\n11. A08:607 (3127)\n12. C15:875 (4002) => Wait, adding C15 now would bring effort to 4002, leaving 8770-4002=4768.\n\nBut up to here, I'm at item 11: A08, total effort 3127.\n\nWait, adding C15 after that would be 3127+875=4002, which is under. Then, perhaps add A16 (645) next: 4002+645=4647, leaving 8770-4647=4123.\n\nThis way, I can include more items.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming without a calculator. Perhaps I can make a more concise proposal that includes the top items without exceeding the limit.\n\nIn any case, I need to ensure that my proposal is within the limit and includes as many high-importance items as possible. Once I have that, I can present it to the user in the correct format, making sure to follow the interaction protocol without any errors this time.\n"

Let me check the total effort to see if it's under the limit. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the items and their efforts:\n\n- A27: 106\n- A30: 213\n- A84: 136\n- B10: 116\n- B45: 60\n- C34: 54\n- A08: 607\n- B09: 446\n- B67: 634\n- B94: 630\n- C70: 125\n- A16: 645\n- B60: 324\n- C15: 875\n\nLet me add these up. \n\n106 + 213 = 319; +136 = 455; +116 = 571; +60 = 631; +54 = 685; +607 = 1292; +446 = 1738; +634 = 2372; +630 = 29992? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1738 + 634 is 2372, then +630 is 29992? No, that's 29992? Wait, I think I miscalculated. Let me start over.\n\nWait, let's add step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd A27: 106\nTotal: 106\n\nA30: +213 → 319\n\nA84: +136 → 455\n\nB10: +116 → 571\n\nB45: +60 → 631\n\nC34: +54 → 685\n\nA08: +607 → 1292\n\nB09: +446 → 1738\n\nB67: +634 → 2372\n\nB94: +630 → 29992? Wait, 2372 + 630 is 3002? Wait, no, 2372 + 600 is 2972, plus 30 is 3002.\n\nC70: +125 → 3127\n\nA16: +645 → 3772\n\nB60: +324 → 4096\n\nC15: +875 → 4096 + 875 = 4971.\n\nWait, so total effort is 4971, which is way below the 8770 limit. That leaves a lot of room for adding more items.\n\nLooking at my own strategy, I focused on high importance-to-effort ratios. The user's proposal includes some of my high-value items, but perhaps we can add more items that benefit me without exceeding the limit.\n\nI should consider which items I can add to maximize my importance. Let me check the remaining items and their efforts:\n\nFrom my initial proposal, I had a larger set, but the user trimmed it down. I should see which items from their proposal can be kept and which can be added without exceeding the limit.\n\nMaybe I can suggest adding B69 (effort 832), but that would push the total to 4971 + 832 = 5803, still under 8770. Or perhaps add multiple smaller items. Alternatively, higher importance ones like B21 (830). Adding B21 and B69 would add 1662, bringing total to 6633, which is still under. But that might be too much, but perhaps we can discuss.\n\nBut wait, the user's argument is that their proposal is efficient. They might not want to add more if they feel it's balanced. Alternatively, maybe I can propose a modified version that includes more items, explaining that the effort allows for more inclusions.\n\nIn my response, I need to REFUSE their proposal, arguing that more items can be added to maximize both parties' benefits without exceeding the limit. Then propose my own set that includes more high-value items for myself while keeping the effort under 8770.\n\nSo I'll refuse their proposal and present an optimized set that includes additional items, ensuring that the total effort is within the limit and highlights the mutual benefit.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the other player's latest proposal and argument. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the other player proposed a set of items with their PROPOSAL. They included a list of items: A27, A30, A84, B10, B45, C34, A08, B09, B67, B94, C70, A16, B60, C15, B69, B21, C92, A58, B75, B53. They also included an ARGUMENT stating that while their proposal includes several high-importance items, the total effort is well below the limit, so we could add more items to benefit both parties.\n\nI need to evaluate this proposal. First, I should check if the total effort of the proposed items is within the 8770 limit. But wait, calculating the total effort for all these items manually would take time. I need to make sure not to exceed the limit, so I should probably total them up.\n\nLooking at the effort values:\n\n- A27: 106\n- A30: 213\n- A84: 136\n- B10: 116\n- B45: 60\n- C34: 54\n- A08: 607\n- B09: 446\n- B67: 634\n- B94: 630\n- C70: 125\n- A16: 645\n- B60: 324\n- C15: 875\n- B69: 832\n- B21: 830\n- C92: 164\n- A58: 252\n- B75: 520\n- B53: 382\n\nAdding these up step by step:\n\nStart adding:\n\n106 (A27) + 213 (A30) = 319\n\n+136 (A84) = 455\n\n+116 (B10) = 571\n\n+60 (B45) = 631\n\n+54 (C34) = 685\n\n+607 (A08) = 1292\n\n+446 (B09) = 1738\n\n+634 (B67) = 2372\n\n+630 (B94) = 3002\n\n+125 (C70) = 3127\n\n+645 (A16) = 3772\n\n+324 (B60) = 4096\n\n+875 (C15) = 4971\n\n+832 (B69) = 5803\n\n+830 (B21) = 6633\n\n+164 (C92) = 6797\n\n+252 (A58) = 7049\n\n+520 (B75) = 7569\n\n+382 (B53) = 7951\n\nSo the total effort is 7951, which is under 8770. That gives us some room to add more items if possible. But the other player is suggesting that we can add more high-value items.\n\nNow, looking at my own importance values, I need to see which items are important to me that are not in this proposal. The current proposal includes A08, B67, B94, C70, A16, B60, C15, etc., which are all high-importance items for me. But there might be other items I value highly that aren't included.\n\nLet me list items not in the current proposal and see their effort and my importance:\n\nLooking through all items:\n\nA05: 801 (I rate 389) – Not in proposal.\nA23: 773 (I rate 262) – Not included.\nA27 is included, so that's covered.\nA30 is included.\nA58 is included.\nA66: 517 (I rate 822) – Not included.\nA84 is included.\nA89: 262 (I rate 508) – Not in proposal.\nB00: 638 (I rate 583) – Not in proposal.\nB12: 946 (I rate 915) – Not included.\nB53 is included.\nB67 included.\nB75 included.\nB85: 842 (I rate 400) – Not included.\nB94 included.\nC06: 980 (I rate 30) – Not included.\nC12: 849 (I rate 668) – Not included.\nC24: 763 (I rate 273) – Not included.\nC35: 106 (I rate 444) – Not in current proposal, but wait, C35 is in the previous proposals. Wait, the current proposal includes C34 and C70, etc.\n\nWait, in the current proposal, C34 is included but C35 isn't. C35's effort is 106, and I value it at 444.\n\nSo maybe adding C35 could be beneficial since it's low effort.\n\nAlso, A66 has high importance for me (822) with an effort of 517. It's not included.\n\nB00 is important (583) with effort 638.\n\nA05 has 801 effort but I value it at 389, which is moderate.\n\nA23 is 773 effort, I value 262.\n\nA89 is 262 effort, I value 508.\n\nC24: 763 effort, I value 273.\n\nB85: 842 effort, I value 400.\n\nB12: 946 effort, I value 915.\n\nSo, considering that I have room up to 8770, and current total is 7951, I have 8770-7951=819 left.\n\nLooking for items not in the proposal that I can add without exceeding the limit.\n\nLooking at the effort of the remaining items:\n\n- A05: 801 – If I add this, it would take 7951+801=8752, which is over the limit. So can't add A05.\n\n- A23: 773 – Adding this would take 7951+773=8724, which is under limit. But do I want to add it? My importance is 262, which is low compared to others.\n\n- A66: 517 – Adding this would take 7951+517=8468. That's under. My importance is 822, which is high. This seems worth adding.\n\n- B00: 638 – Adding this would take 7951+638=8589. Under. My importance is 583, which is good.\n\n- B12: 946 – Adding this would take 7951+946=8897, which is over.\n\n- C24: 763 – 7951+763=8714. Under, but my importance is only 273.\n\n- B85: 842 – 7951+842=8793, which is over.\n\nSo, possible candidates are A23, A66, B00, C24.\n\nBut A66 and B00 have higher importance for me, but their effort adds up.\n\nLet me try adding A66 (517). That would bring the total effort to 7951+517=8468, leaving 8770-8468=302.\n\nThen, with 302 left, can I add more?\n\nLooking at remaining items, perhaps B00 is 638, but that's too high. Next, A23 is 773, too high. B45 is already included. C35 is 106, which is low. Let's check C35's effort: 106. Adding that would take 8468+106=8574, leaving 8770-8574=196.\n\nNow, is there anything else I can add with 196 effort left? Let's see:\n\nLooking for items with effort <=196.\n\nLooking at the items not yet included:\n\nC35: 106 – already considered.\n\nB46: 407 – too high.\n\nB53: 382 – already included.\n\nWait, perhaps other items:\n\nC06: 980 – too high.\n\nC70 is already included.\n\nWait, A27: 106 – already included.\n\nWait, let me double-check the current proposal. The current proposal includes A27, A30, A84, B10, B45, C34, A08, B09, B67, B94, C70, A16, B60, C15, B69, B21, C92, A58, B75, B53. So, B53 is in.\n\nSo, among remaining items, the only one with effort <=196 is C35 (106). So, adding C35 and A66 would take 517+106=623 added to the current 7951, totaling 8574. Then, 8770-8574=196 left. No other items have effort <=196 except maybe B53, but it's already included.\n\nWait, is there any other item with effort less than 196 left? Let's list the remaining items:\n\nAfter adding A66 and C35, the remaining items not in the proposal are:\n\nA23, A05, B00, B12, B85, C24, A89, C06.\n\nTheir efforts: 773, 801, 638, 946, 842, 763, 262, 980. So, A89 has effort 262. Adding that would exceed the remaining 196. So, no, nothing else can be added.\n\nBut wait, A89's effort is 262. So after adding A66 (517) and C35 (106), which brings the total to 8574, we have 196 left. 196 is less than 262, so we can't add A89.\n\nAlternatively, if we add A66 (517) alone, the total would be 8468, leaving 302. Can I add anything else with 302?\n\nLooking for items with effort <=302:\n\nA89: 262 – can be added, as 8468 +262=8730. Then, 8770-8730=40 left. Is there anything with effort <=40? Looking through, nothing is that low. So, adding A89 would allow total effort 8730, and then I could add another item if possible, but nothing else is under 40.\n\nSo, adding A66 and A89 would give me:\n\nTotal effort: 7951 +517 (A66) +262 (A89) = 7951+779=8730. Under the limit. That's a good addition because both A66 and A89 have high importance for me (822 and 508 respectively).\n\nLet me check if these items are already in the proposal or not. The current proposal doesn't include A66 or A89, so adding them is possible.\n\nSo, the new proposal would include all the original items plus A66 and A89. Let me confirm the total effort:\n\nOriginal total: 7951\n\nAdding A66: +517 = 8468\n\nAdding A89: +262 = 8730\n\nWhich is under 8770, so acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider adding B00 (638), which is also important (583), but 7951 +638=8589, leaving 8770-8589=181. I could then add C35 (106) for a total of 8589+106=8695, leaving 75. Can't add anything else. But B00's importance is 583, which is less than A66's 822, so probably better to add A66 and A89.\n\nAnother option: instead of adding both A66 and A89, check if there's a combination that adds more importance. For instance, A66 alone adds 822, A89 adds 508, which totals 1330 in importance. If I add both, I get higher importance than adding B00 (583) and C35 (444), which would be 1027. So, better to add A66 and A89.\n\nTherefore, the new proposal should include the original set plus A66 and A89, making the total effort 8730, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the new PROPOSAL will include all the original items (20 items) plus A66 and A89, making it 22 items. I'll present this as a new proposal.\n\nI'll also need to include an ARGUMENT explaining that this addition increases the total importance to me without exceeding the effort limit.\n"

            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to respond to the user's latest proposal in this negotiation game. Let me see what they've done. They've included some additional high-importance items for themselves, like A66 and A89, which makes sense because those are valuable to them. The effort is still under the limit, which is good. But I need to evaluate if this is acceptable for me or if I can negotiate further to get a better deal.\n\nLooking at the items they added: A66 and A89. I know from my own data that A66 has an effort of 517 and an importance of 822, which is a high importance for me as well. A89 has an effort of 262 and an importance of 508. So, including these does take away from the effort pool but doesn't drastically affect my own potential items. \n\nI also need to check if the total effort is within the limit. The user mentioned it's 8730, which is under 8770, so that's fine. But I should verify that to be sure. Let me add up the efforts of all the proposed items to confirm. \n\nWait, I should also think about the items I wanted that are not included. For example, B74 or C81 might be important to me. If this proposal includes more of their high-importance items, I might be missing out on some of mine. \n\nPerhaps I can offer an alternative that swaps some of the lower-importance items for me but keeps the effort similar. For instance, if I remove A89, which is important to them, maybe they can add something that's more valuable to me instead. \n\nI also notice that some of the items in the proposal, like B53 and B75, have lower importance for me but are included. Maybe I can suggest replacing those with items that have higher importance for me without increasing the effort too much. \n\nAnother angle is to ensure that the proposal isn't too one-sided. If it's heavily favoring their high-importance items, I might want to negotiate a more balanced set where both of us get significant value. \n\nI should calculate the total effort again to be sure. Let me list all the items and add up their efforts:\n\n- A27: 106\n- A30: 213\n- A84: 136\n- B10: 116\n- B45: 60\n- C34: 54\n- A08: 607\n- B09: 446\n- B67: 634\n- B94: 630\n- C70: 125\n- A16: 645\n- B60: 324\n- C15: 875\n- B69: 832\n- B21: 830\n- C92: 164\n- A58: 252\n- B75: 520\n- B53: 382\n- A66: 517\n- A89: 262\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\nStarting from the top:\n106 + 213 = 319\n319 + 136 = 455\n455 + 116 = 571\n571 + 60 = 631\n631 + 54 = 685\n685 + 607 = 1292\n1292 + 446 = 1738\n1738 + 634 = 2372\n2372 + 630 = 3002\n3002 + 125 = 3127\n3127 + 645 = 3772\n3772 + 324 = 4096\n4096 + 875 = 4971\n4971 + 832 = 5803\n5803 + 830 = 6633\n6633 + 164 = 6797\n6797 + 252 = 7049\n7049 + 520 = 7569\n7569 + 382 = 7951\n7951 + 517 = 8468\n8468 + 262 = 8730\n\nOkay, so the total effort is indeed 8730, which is under the limit. \n\nLooking at this, the proposal is valid. But I should consider if this is the best possible outcome for me. Are there any items I can swap or add that would increase my total importance without exceeding the effort limit? For example, perhaps I can suggest adding an item like C06, which has an effort of 980 but I haven't seen it in the proposal. It has an importance of 30 for me, so it might not be worth it. Alternatively, maybe B00 with an effort of 638 and importance of 583 could be added if we remove some lower-value items.\n\nWait, B00 isn't in the current proposal. If I can include that, it would increase my total importance. Let's see if there's room. The current effort is 8730, leaving 40 units of effort. B00 requires 638, which is too much. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some smaller items can be added or swapped. For instance, swapping out B53 (effort 382, importance 65 for me) for something else. If I remove B53, that frees up 382 effort. Maybe I can add two or more items with combined effort less than 382 that have higher importance for me. Let's look at the remaining items. What's left?\n\nLooking at the effort list, items not in the proposal include A05 (801), A23 (773), C06 (980), B12 (946), etc. These are all high effort, so not feasible. Maybe C24 (763) is too high. C35 (106) is already in the proposal. B46 (407) is in the proposal. Wait, B46 is included, with an effort of 407 and importance of 606 for me. So maybe B46 is already a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can swap B53 for a combination of smaller items. For example, removing B53 (382) could allow adding B85 (842), but that's too much effort. Alternatively, adding multiple smaller items like A27 (106), but that's already included. Maybe A05 (801) is too big but perhaps parts of it? No, we can't split items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to optimize. If I think about the ratios again, maybe there's a combination that gives me a higher total importance without exceeding the effort.\n\nBut considering the time constraints and the fact that the proposal is already quite comprehensive, maybe it's acceptable. I can also consider that the other player has included many of their high-importance items, so pushing for more might not be feasible without them refusing.\n\nPerhaps I should accept the proposal, as it's a valid and efficient set, but I need to make sure it's the best I can get. Alternatively, I can make a counter-proposal that tweaks it a bit more in my favor.\n\nWait, the user's proposal includes A66 and A89, which are important to them. I need to see if those are so critical that they might refuse any changes. If I try to remove them to add something else, they might reject it. Maybe it's better to accept and end the negotiation here with a good but not perfect outcome.\n\nAlternatively, I can propose a slight modification to include an item that's more beneficial for me without increasing the effort too much. For example, if I remove a lower-importance item for me and add a higher one within the effort limit.\n\nLet me check: Are there any items not in the proposal that I can add? For example, C81 (601 effort, importance 713 for me) isn't in the proposal. But that would require additional effort. Since the current proposal is at 8730, adding C81 would exceed the limit as 8730 + 601 is 9331, way over. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe removing a lower-importance item and adding a slightly lower effort one. For instance, if I remove C92 (164) and add something else. Wait, C92 is already in the proposal, and my importance for it is 215. Maybe that's not worth it.\n\nI think I need to consider that the proposal is as optimized as it can be given the constraints. Therefore, I should agree to this proposal to maximize my benefit as much as possible without exceeding the effort limit.\n"
