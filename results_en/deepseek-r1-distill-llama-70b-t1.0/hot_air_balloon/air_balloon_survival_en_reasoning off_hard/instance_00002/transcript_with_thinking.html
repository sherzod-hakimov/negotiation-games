        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 3203<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;A21&quot;: 52, &quot;B93&quot;: 577, &quot;A11&quot;: 177, &quot;B33&quot;: 702, &quot;C08&quot;: 119, &quot;B39&quot;: 232, &quot;B96&quot;: 577, &quot;C85&quot;: 205, &quot;A82&quot;: 516, &quot;B31&quot;: 582, &quot;B20&quot;: 676, &quot;A60&quot;: 906, &quot;B09&quot;: 316, &quot;C81&quot;: 433, &quot;B21&quot;: 336}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;A21&quot;: 138, &quot;B93&quot;: 583, &quot;A11&quot;: 868, &quot;B33&quot;: 822, &quot;C08&quot;: 783, &quot;B39&quot;: 65, &quot;B96&quot;: 262, &quot;C85&quot;: 121, &quot;A82&quot;: 508, &quot;B31&quot;: 780, &quot;B20&quot;: 461, &quot;A60&quot;: 484, &quot;B09&quot;: 668, &quot;C81&quot;: 389, &quot;B21&quot;: 808}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to maximize my own importance from the items while staying within the effort limit of 3203. First, I need to understand the situation.<br/><br/>Looking at the items, each has an effort and an importance value from my perspective. The other participant doesn&#x27;t know my importance values, and I don&#x27;t know theirs. Our goal is to agree on a set of items where the total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 3203, and I want to make sure that this set gives me the highest possible total importance.<br/><br/>I should start by prioritizing the items based on their importance-to-effort ratio for me. That way, I can pick the items that give me the most importance per unit of effort first.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the importance-to-effort ratio for each item:<br/><br/>- A21: 138/52 ≈ 2.65<br/>- B93: 583/577 ≈ 1.01<br/>- A11: 868/177 ≈ 4.90<br/>- B33: 822/702 ≈ 1.17<br/>- C08: 783/119 ≈ 6.58<br/>- B39: 65/232 ≈ 0.28<br/>- B96: 262/577 ≈ 0.45<br/>- C85: 121/205 ≈ 0.59<br/>- A82: 508/516 ≈ 0.98<br/>- B31: 780/582 ≈ 1.34<br/>- B20: 461/676 ≈ 0.68<br/>- A60: 484/906 ≈ 0.53<br/>- B09: 668/316 ≈ 2.11<br/>- C81: 389/433 ≈ 0.90<br/>- B21: 808/336 ≈ 2.40<br/><br/>From this, I can sort them starting with the highest ratio:<br/><br/>1. C08: ~6.58<br/>2. A11: ~4.90<br/>3. B21: ~2.40<br/>4. A21: ~2.65<br/>5. B09: ~2.11<br/>6. B31: ~1.34<br/>7. B33: ~1.17<br/>8. B93: ~1.01<br/>9. A82: ~0.98<br/>10. C81: ~0.90<br/>11. B20: ~0.68<br/>12. C85: ~0.59<br/>13. A60: ~0.53<br/>14. B96: ~0.45<br/>15. B39: ~0.28<br/><br/>Now, I&#x27;ll try to select items starting from the top until I hit the effort limit.<br/><br/>Starting with C08 (119). Total effort: 119. Remaining effort: 3203 - 119 = 3084.<br/><br/>Next, A11 (177). Total effort: 119 + 177 = 296. Remaining: 3203 - 296 = 2907.<br/><br/>Next, C08, A11, A21 next? Wait, let me see the order.<br/><br/>Wait, the highest ratio after C08 is A11, then B21, then A21, B09, etc.<br/><br/>So after C08 and A11, next is B21 (336). Total effort: 119 + 177 + 336 = 632. Remaining: 3203 - 632 = 2571.<br/><br/>Next, A21 (52). Adding that would be 632 + 52 = 684. Remaining: 3203 - 684 = 2519.<br/><br/>Then B09 (316). 684 + 316 = 1000. Remaining: 3203 - 1000 = 2203.<br/><br/>Next, B31 (582). 1000 + 582 = 1582. Remaining: 3203 - 1582 = 1621.<br/><br/>Next, B33 (702). 1582 + 702 = 2284. Remaining: 3203 - 2284 = 919.<br/><br/>Next, B93 (577). 2284 + 577 = 2861. Remaining: 3203 - 2861 = 342.<br/><br/>Now, from the remaining items, can I fit anything else? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items, what has an effort ≤ 342.<br/><br/>Looking at the next in ratio: A82 (516) – that&#x27;s too big. C81 (433) is also too big. B20 (676) too big. Then perhaps C85 (205). 205 is within 342.<br/><br/>Wait, but I haven&#x27;t added C85 yet. Wait, in my selection so far, I have: C08, A11, B21, A21, B09, B31, B33, B93. Total effort: 119+177+336+52+316+582+702+577 = let me calculate step by step:<br/><br/>119 +177 = 296<br/>+336 = 632<br/>+52=684<br/>+316=1000<br/>+582=1582<br/>+702=2284<br/>+577=2861<br/><br/>Total effort so far: 2861. Remaining: 3203-2861=342.<br/><br/>Now, the next in my priority list is B93, which I added, then the next would be A82 (508), but that&#x27;s too big. Next is C81 (433), which is also over 342. Then B20 (676), which is too big. Then C85 (205). Effort 205. Adding that: 2861+205=3066. Remaining: 3203-3066=137.<br/><br/>Now, any item with effort ≤137? Looking at the remaining items: B96 (577), B39 (232), which are too big, B96 already considered. A60 (906), too big. B09 is already included. B21 included. So maybe A82, but that&#x27;s 516.<br/><br/>Alternatively, any smaller items left.<br/><br/>Wait, let me check if I missed any items. The items I have selected so far are: C08, A11, B21, A21, B09, B31, B33, B93, C85.<br/><br/>Total effort: 2861 +205=3066.<br/><br/>Remaining: 137.<br/><br/>Looking for items not yet selected with effort ≤137.<br/><br/>Looking through the initial list:<br/><br/>A21:52 (included)<br/>C08:119 (included)<br/>B39:232 (too big)<br/>B96:577 (too big)<br/>C85:205 (included)<br/>A82:516 (too big)<br/>B31:582 (included)<br/>B20:676 (too big)<br/>A60:906 (too big)<br/>B09:316 (included)<br/>C81:433 (too big)<br/>B21:336 (included)<br/>B93:577 (included)<br/>A11:177 (included)<br/>B33:702 (included)<br/>B09:316 (included)<br/>B31:582 (included)<br/>B20:676 (included)<br/>B96:577 (included)<br/>A60:906 (included)<br/>Hmm, I think I might have included some high-effort items that perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have, because I&#x27;m only left with 137, but maybe I should see if there is any smaller items I can add.<br/><br/>Wait, C08 and A21 are already included. Let me check other items.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I didn&#x27;t include some lower effort items that could fit into the remaining 137.<br/><br/>For example, B39:232, which is too big. B96:577, too big. A60:906, too big. The only smaller ones are perhaps B39 is already too big. No, I think I&#x27;ve included all the small ones except perhaps C08 and A21. So perhaps no more items can be added.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe if I adjust which items I pick earlier on to leave room for more high-importance items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should try a different approach: selecting items that give me the highest total importance without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps a knapsack approach where I pick items that give the maximum importance without exceeding the effort.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s priorities, I need to propose a set that I think is acceptable to both, but I&#x27;m trying to maximize my own.<br/><br/>Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a set that includes high-importance items for me and perhaps some that the other player might also value, to make it easier to agree.<br/><br/>But without knowing their priorities, it&#x27;s tricky. So perhaps I should focus purely on my own max importance within the effort limit.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s see: if I take the top items in my priority list until I hit the limit.<br/><br/>So starting from the top:<br/><br/>C08 (119) is a must. Then A11 (177), that&#x27;s 296. Then B21 (336), total 632. Then A21 (52) makes 684. Then B09 (316) brings it to 1000. Then B31 (582) makes 1582. Then B33 (702) brings it to 2284. Then B93 (577) makes 2861. Then C85 (205) brings it to 3066. Then the remaining 137 can&#x27;t fit A82 (516) or C81 (433), so that&#x27;s 3066 total, but is that the max?<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps replacing some lower priority items with higher importance ones.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should consider the total importance.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the total importance of the selected items:<br/><br/>C08:783<br/>A11:868<br/>B21:808<br/>A21:138<br/>B09:668<br/>B31:780<br/>B33:822<br/>B93:583<br/>C85:121<br/><br/>Total: Let&#x27;s add them step by step.<br/><br/>783 (C08)<br/>+868 = 1651<br/>+808 = 2459<br/>+138 = 2597<br/>+668 = 3265<br/>+780 = 4045<br/>+822 = 4867<br/>+583 = 5450<br/>+121 = 5571<br/><br/>So total importance would be 5571.<br/><br/>Is there a way to increase this? Maybe by swapping some items.<br/><br/>For example, after 3066 effort, I can&#x27;t add anything else. But perhaps if I remove some items with lower importance per effort ratio and include others.<br/><br/>Wait, for example, if I remove B93 (effort 577, importance 583) and add A82 (effort 516, importance 508) and maybe something else. Let me see:<br/><br/>If I remove B93 (577) and add A82 (516), that frees up 577 - 516 = 61 effort. So total effort would be 3066 - 577 + 516 = 3005. Then I have 3203 - 3005 = 198 left. But is there an item that fits into 198?<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items, perhaps B39 (232) is too big. B96 (577) too big. B09 is already included. Maybe no other items can fit, so total effort remains 3005, but the importance would be 5571 - 583 + 508 = 5500 - 583 is 4989, plus 508 is 5497. So it&#x27;s actually lower. So not better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing B93 with A82 and another item. But I don&#x27;t think that helps.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe removing B33 (702 effort, 822 importance) and adding other items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>If I remove B33 (702), that frees up 702. So starting from the current selection without B33, the total effort would be 2861 - 702 = 2159. Then, perhaps I can add B31 (582) but I already have that. Wait, no, if I remove B33, can I add something else. Hmm, perhaps that&#x27;s more complicated.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe instead of including B31 (582 effort), perhaps replacing it with a combination of smaller items.<br/><br/>Wait, but B31 has a high importance for me, 780. Let me check the alternative: for 582 effort, can I get higher total importance?<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items, perhaps including B31 is worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps including more items could give a higher total.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps instead of including C85 (205, 121), which is low importance, I could use that effort for something else.<br/><br/>If I remove C85 (205), I have 205 extra effort. Then, maybe I can include B39 (232), but that would require 232, which is more than 205, so no. Or perhaps B96 (577) is too big. Alternatively, A60 (906) is too big. So perhaps no better use of that 205.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can include B20 (676) which is high effort but also high importance (461). But 676 is too big when I have only 205 left. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust earlier picks to include B20 instead of something else. Let me see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I&#x27;m overcomplicating. Maybe the initial selection is already the best I can do, giving me a total importance of 5571.<br/><br/>But wait, let me check if I can include more items by adjusting.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s try a different approach. Let&#x27;s start selecting items with the highest importance per effort, but also try to see how to fit more high-importance items.<br/><br/>Here&#x27;s another approach: the total effort limit is 3203. Let me try to include as many high-importance items as possible without exceeding the limit.<br/><br/>C08 is a must: 119, 783.<br/><br/>Next, A11:177, 868. Total: 296, importance 1651.<br/><br/>Next, B21:336, 808. Total: 632, importance 2459.<br/><br/>Next, A21:52,138. Total:684, importance 2597.<br/><br/>Next, B09:316,668. Total:1000, importance 3265.<br/><br/>Next, B31:582,780. Total:1582, importance 4045.<br/><br/>Next, B33:702,822. Total:2284, importance 4867.<br/><br/>Next, B93:577,583. Total:2861, importance 5450.<br/><br/>Then, C85:205,121. Now, total effort:3066, importance 5571.<br/><br/>Remaining effort:137. Can&#x27;t add anything else.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps instead of including B93 and C85, I can replace them with other items.<br/><br/>Wait, B93 has 577 effort and 583 importance. C85 has 205 effort and 121 importance. So together, 577+205=782 effort, 583+121=704 importance.<br/><br/>Is there a combination that uses 782 effort better? Maybe including other items.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s see: 782 effort, can I get more than 704 importance?<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items not yet selected:<br/><br/>A82:516,508<br/><br/>C81:433,389<br/><br/>B20:676,461<br/><br/>B96:577,262<br/><br/>B39:232,65<br/><br/>A60:906,484<br/><br/>So, can I pick two items that together use up 782 effort without exceeding it, and give more than 704 importance?<br/><br/>For example, A82 (516) and C81 (433). Total effort:516+433=949, which is over 782, so no. So can&#x27;t do that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, A82 (516) and B39 (232). 516+232=748, which is under 782. Importance:508+65=573, which is less than 704. Not better.<br/><br/>Another option: C81 (433) and B96 (577). But 433+577=1010, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, B20 (676) alone. 676 &lt;782, leaves 106. But 676 alone gives 461 importance.<br/><br/>If I add B39 (232), but 676+232=908 &gt;782, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, B20 (676) alone gives 461, which is less than 704. So that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Another option: B96 (577) alone. 577&lt;782, giving 262, then with 782-577=205 left, can I add C85 (205) for 121. So total:262+121=383, which is less than 704.<br/><br/>Alternatively, B93 and C85 give 704, which is better than other combinations.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a better way: what if I don&#x27;t take B93 and C85, but take A82 and B96. Let&#x27;s see effort:516+577=1093, which is over 782. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, A82 (516) and B20 (676) is 516+676=1192&gt;782, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, A82 and B39:516+232=748&lt;782. Importance:508+65=573&lt;704. Not better.<br/><br/>So, perhaps the initial selection is better, as it gives higher importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take C81 (433) and B96 (577), but that would be 433+577=1010&gt;782. No.<br/><br/>Alternatively, C81 alone:433. Then 782-433=349 left. What can I add? Looking for items ≤349.<br/><br/>Looking back, B09 is already taken, so other items: B20 is 676 too big. B39:232. 433+232=665&lt;782. So, 665. Importance:389+65=454. That&#x27;s worse than 704.<br/><br/>So, I think the initial selection is better.<br/><br/>But perhaps I can find a way to include more high-importance items without going over the effort limit.<br/><br/>Wait, another thought: perhaps I should prioritize items with higher effort but also higher importance, as long as they fit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I include A11 (177) and C08 (119), that&#x27;s 296 effort, and high importance:868+783=1651.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s think differently: perhaps using a branch and bound approach, but that&#x27;s time-consuming manually.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can try to get the maximum possible by including the top items.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ve tried that already. So, my initial selection gives me 5571 total importance. Maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can offer a proposal that includes these items, but I should also consider the other player&#x27;s possible preferences.<br/><br/>But without knowing their importance, it&#x27;s hard. However, I can try to make a proposal that includes items that might be important to both of us, to encourage agreement.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can make a proposal that includes a mix of high-importance items for me and some that are likely high for the other player as well.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their importance, so I can&#x27;t tell.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should make a proposal that I think is near the maximum I can get, and see if the other player agrees.<br/><br/>So, based on my selection, the items would be:<br/><br/>C08, A11, B21, A21, B09, B31, B33, B93, C85.<br/><br/>But let me check their efforts:<br/><br/>C08:119<br/><br/>A11:177<br/><br/>B21:336<br/><br/>A21:52<br/><br/>B09:316<br/><br/>B31:582<br/><br/>B33:702<br/><br/>B93:577<br/><br/>C85:205<br/><br/>Total effort:119+177=296+336=632+52=684+316=1000+582=1582+702=2284+577=2861+205=3066.<br/><br/>Remaining effort:137.<br/><br/>So, can&#x27;t include anything else.<br/><br/>I think I should propose this set, as it maximizes my total importance.<br/><br/>But perhaps I should consider that the other player might prefer certain items, so maybe I can adjust to include some items they might value more, but without reducing my own total too much.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should just go with this proposal.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll prepare a PROPOSAL with these items.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, I just got a message from the user, and I need to figure out how to respond correctly. Let me break down what&#x27;s happening here.<br/><br/>So, the user is part of a collaborative negotiation game. The goal is to agree on a set of items where the total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed a limit, which is 3203 in this case. Each participant has their own importance values for the items but can&#x27;t see the other&#x27;s. The interaction requires specific structured formats, and in the previous attempt, the user forgot to include the ARGUMENT tag properly. They proposed a set of items, but the argument was just a sentence without the correct structure. <br/><br/>Now, the user sent a second response that starts with &quot;ARGUMENT: ...&quot; but it&#x27;s just a timestamp placeholder. They need to make sure the argument is a proper set of strings, but in this context, it&#x27;s a bit confusing because the argument is more about the reasoning. Wait, no, looking back, the interaction protocol specifies that ARGUMENT should be a set containing strings, but the user might have misunderstood and just placed a timestamp there. <br/><br/>Looking at the requirements again, I realize the user&#x27;s main issue was not including the ARGUMENT in the correct structured format. So in their second try, they included ARGUMENT: {&quot;...&quot;}, but maybe they didn&#x27;t fill it correctly. Now, I need to correct that.<br/><br/>So, I should provide a proper PROPOSAL and a valid ARGUMENT. The proposal should be a set of items, and the argument should be a set of strings, perhaps highlighting why the proposal is good without revealing their true importance. <br/><br/>I think the user wants to maximize their own total importance while keeping effort under 3203. So, they need to select items that balance high importance with manageable effort. I should suggest a set that efficiently uses the effort limit, perhaps by including a mix of items that are crucial to them but don&#x27;t consume too much effort.<br/><br/>In my response, I should first acknowledge their concern about the argument format. Then, propose a new set of items that maximizes their importance, and provide an ARGUMENT explaining why this set is beneficial—without revealing their importance scores. <br/><br/>I should calculate the total effort of the proposed items to ensure it&#x27;s within the limit. Let&#x27;s see, the items I chose: <br/><br/>- A21: 52<br/>- B93: 577<br/>- A11: 177<br/>- B33: 702<br/>- C08: 119<br/>- B39: 232<br/>- B96: 577<br/>- C85: 205<br/>- A82: 516<br/>- B31: 582<br/>- B20: 676<br/>- A60: 906<br/>- B09: 316<br/>- C81: 433<br/>- B21: 336<br/><br/>Wait, no, my proposed set in the previous response was {&#x27;A21&#x27;, &#x27;B93&#x27;, &#x27;A11&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;C08&#x27;, &#x27;B39&#x27;, &#x27;B96&#x27;, &#x27;C85&#x27;, &#x27;A82&#x27;, &#x27;B31&#x27;, &#x27;B20&#x27;, &#x27;A60&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;C81&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;}, but that seems like all the items. That can&#x27;t be right because the total effort would exceed the limit. I need to correct that.<br/><br/>I made a mistake there. I should select a subset that stays within 3203. Let me recalculate. <br/><br/>Perhaps include the highest importance items first, considering their effort. For example, A11 is high importance for me and has an effort of 177. B93 is also high with effort 577. Then, I can add others like B33 (702), C08 (119), B21 (336), etc., making sure the total doesn&#x27;t go over.<br/><br/>I think the key is to propose a subset that is both efficient in effort and high in importance, and back it up with an argument that explains the reasoning in a way that persuades the other player without giving away my real priorities.<br/><br/>So, in my response, I need to:<br/><br/>1. Apologize for the previous mistake.<br/>2. Propose a valid set of items with total effort under 3203.<br/>3. Provide an ARGUMENT explaining why this set is optimal, focusing on effort management and importance without specifics.<br/><br/>I need to ensure that the structured formats are correct, so the proposal is a set, and the argument is a set of strings explaining the reasoning.<br/><br/>Finally, I&#x27;ll present the revised proposal with the correct structure and a valid argument.<br/></p>

        <p>Apologies for the confusion earlier. I&#x27;m committed to proposing a set that works for both of us within the effort limit.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A11&#x27;, &#x27;B93&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;, &#x27;C08&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;, &#x27;B31&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: This set balances high importance items with manageable effort, ensuring we maximize our shared benefit without exceeding the limit of 3203. It includes a variety of items across different categories, which strengthens our collective outcome while respecting the effort constraint.</p>

        <p>Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user&#x27;s last message. They&#x27;re participating in a negotiation game where they and another player have to agree on a set of items under a shared effort limit. The goal is to maximize the user&#x27;s total importance without revealing their own values. <br/><br/>Looking back at the history, the user initially proposed a set, but there was a misunderstanding with the formatting. They corrected it but still faced an issue with the argument not being properly included. Now, the user proposed another set but again didn&#x27;t include the ARGUMENT tag correctly, which the system pointed out.<br/><br/>So, the user needs to propose a new set while ensuring that they include the ARGUMENT tag with a set of strings as the argument. The proposal must be valid, with total effort ≤ 3203.<br/><br/>I should help the user by providing a correctly formatted response. Perhaps they can use the same items but structure the message properly. The argument can justify the selection based on effort distribution and importance without revealing their true values.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll suggest a proposal and an argument that fits the required structure, ensuring the effort doesn&#x27;t exceed the limit. This way, the user can continue the negotiation effectively.<br/></p>
