I need to maximize my total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 3629. \n\nFirst, I should prioritize the items based on their importance to me relative to their effort. That is, calculate the importance per unit effort for each item. That way, I can see which items give me the most bang for the buck.\n\nLet me list out all the items with their effort and my importance:\n\n- A21: Effort 5, Importance 138\n- A11: 21, 868\n- A60:287,484\n- A82:87,508\n- B20:230,461\n- B09:698,668\n- B93:793,583\n- B31:761,780\n- B33:842,822\n- B39:842,65\n- B96:631,262\n- B21:882,808\n- C08:313,783\n- C81:641,389\n- C85:226,121\n\nNow, calculating the importance per effort:\n\nA21: 138/5 = 27.6\nA11:868/21\u224841.33\nA60:484/287\u22481.685\nA82:508/87\u22485.839\nB20:461/230\u22482.004\nB09:668/698\u22480.956\nB93:583/793\u22480.735\nB31:780/761\u22481.025\nB33:822/842\u22480.976\nB39:65/842\u22480.077\nB96:262/631\u22480.415\nB21:808/882\u22480.916\nC08:783/313\u22482.502\nC81:389/641\u22480.607\nC85:121/226\u22480.535\n\nSo, ordering them from highest to lowest importance per effort:\n\nA11, A21, A82, C08, B20, A60, B31, B93, B33, B21, C81, B09, B39, B96, C85.\n\nWait, let me make sure I ordered them correctly based on the numbers.\n\n1. A11: ~41.33\n2. A21: 27.6\n3. A82: ~5.839\n4. C08: ~2.502\n5. B20: ~2.004\n6. A60: ~1.685\n7. B31: ~1.025\n8. B93: ~0.735\n9. B33: ~0.976 (Wait, 0.976 is higher than B93's 0.735, so maybe I need to correct the order)\nWait, perhaps I should list all with exact values:\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nA11: 868/21 \u2248 41.333\nA21:138/5=27.6\nA82:508/87\u22485.839\nC08:783/313\u22482.502\nB20:461/230\u22482.004\nA60:484/287\u22481.685\nB31:780/761\u22481.025\nB33:822/842\u22480.976\nB93:583/793\u22480.735\nB21:808/882\u22480.916\nC81:389/641\u22480.607\nB09:668/698\u22480.956\nB39:65/842\u22480.077\nB96:262/631\u22480.415\nC85:121/226\u22480.535\n\nSo in order:\n\n1. A11 (41.33)\n2. A21 (27.6)\n3. A82 (5.839)\n4. C08 (2.502)\n5. B20 (2.004)\n6. A60 (1.685)\n7. B31 (1.025)\n8. B33 (0.976)\n9. B21 (0.916)\n10. B09 (0.956)\n11. B93 (0.735)\n12. C81 (0.607)\n13. B96 (0.415)\n14. C85 (0.535)\n15. B39 (0.077)\n\nWait, I think I messed up the order above. Let me correct it step by step.\n\nAfter A11, A21, A82, C08, B20, then next is A60 (1.685). Then B31 (1.025), then B33 (0.976), B21 (0.916), B09 (0.956), B93 (0.735), C81 (0.607), B96 (0.415), C85 (0.535), B39 (0.077).\n\nWait, but B09 has 0.956, which is higher than B21's 0.916, so should come before. Let me adjust:\n\nAfter B33 (0.976), next is B09 (0.956), then B21 (0.916), then B93 (0.735), C81 (0.607), then B96 (0.415), C85 (0.535), B39 (0.077).\n\nSo the priority list is:\n\n1. A11\n2. A21\n3. A82\n4. C08\n5. B20\n6. A60\n7. B31\n8. B33\n9. B09\n10. B21\n11. B93\n12. C81\n13. B96\n14. C85\n15. B39\n\nNow, I need to select items in this order until I hit the effort limit.\n\nLet's start adding them one by one and keep a running total of effort and importance.\n\nStart with A11: Effort=21, Importance=868.\n\nTotal Effort:21, Total Importance:868.\n\nNext, A21: Effort=5, Total Effort=26, Importance=138. Total Importance=1006.\n\nNext, A82: Effort=87, Total Effort=26+87=113, Importance=508. Total Importance=1514.\n\nNext, C08: Effort=313, Total Effort=113+313=426, Importance=783. Total Importance=2297.\n\nNext, B20: Effort=230, Total Effort=426+230=656, Importance=461. Total Importance=2758.\n\nNext, A60: Effort=287, Total Effort=656+287=943, Importance=484. Total Importance=3242.\n\nNext, B31: Effort=761, but 943+761=1704, which is under 3629. So add it. Total Effort=1704, Importance=780. Total Importance=4022.\n\nNext, B33: Effort=842, current total effort=1704+842=2546 (Wait, no, 1704+842=2546, which is still under 3629). Add it. Importance=822. Total Importance=4022+822=4844.\n\nNext, B09: Effort=698. Adding 2546+698=3244, which is under 3629. Importance=668. Total Importance=5512.\n\nNext, B21: Effort=882. Adding 3244+882=4126. Under 3629. Importance=808. Total Importance=6320.\n\nWait, but 4126 is more than 3629. Oops, can't add B21. So I have to stop before that.\n\nWait, let me correct. Let's go step by step:\n\nAfter adding B33, total effort is 2546. Remaining effort is 3629-2546=1083.\n\nNext item is B09 (Effort=698). 2546+698=3244. Importance=668. Now, Total Effort=3244, remaining=3629-3244=385.\n\nNext item is B21: Effort=882, which is more than remaining 385, so can't add.\n\nThen B93: Effort=793. 793>385, can't add.\n\nC81: Effort=641>385.\n\nB96:631>385.\n\nC85:226\u2264385. So add C85. Effort=226, so total effort=3244+226=3470. Importance=121. Total Importance=5512+121=5633. Remaining effort=3629-3470=159.\n\nNext, B09's next is B21, but it's too big. So check next items: B93 (793), C81 (641), B96 (631), C85 already added, B39 (842). All are too big. So we can't add anything else. So the total is 5633.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can swap some items to include higher importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, after adding B33 (effort 842), I have 2546. Next, instead of adding B09, which uses 698, perhaps I can add something else.\n\nWait, the order is based on importance per effort, so B09 should be next. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if combining other items after B33 gives a better total.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the total effort so far after B33: 2546. Remaining effort:1083.\n\nIf I take B09 (698), then remaining is 385, and I can add C85 (226), total effort 698+226=924, which is within 1083.\n\nBut I can't add more. Alternatively, is there a way to replace some items to get higher total importance?\n\nWait, but since I'm following the priority list, I might be missing better combinations. Maybe a different selection would yield higher importance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try a different approach, like including B93 or B31 earlier.\n\nBut I think the priority list is the standard way, so I'll proceed with that.\n\nWait, but let me check the total I have: up to C85, I have total importance 5633.\n\nIs there a way to get higher? For example, dropping B20 (effort 230, importance 461) and adding other items. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if adding B93 instead of B20 and others. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no, B20 is higher in the priority list because its importance per effort is higher than B93.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see what's the maximum I can get.\n\nBut I think I should proceed with selecting items in priority order until the effort is reached.\n\nSo the selected items are A11, A21, A82, C08, B20, A60, B31, B33, B09, C85. Let me confirm the total effort.\n\nCalculate effort: A11(21) + A21(5) + A82(87) + C08(313) + B20(230) + A60(287) + B31(761) + B33(842) + B09(698) + C85(226).\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n21+5=26\n\n+87=113\n\n+313=426\n\n+230=656\n\n+287=943\n\n+761=1704\n\n+842=2546\n\n+698=3244\n\n+226=3470.\n\nYes, 3470, which is under 3629.\n\nTotal importance: 868+138+508+783+461+484+780+822+668+121= let's add step by step:\n\n868+138=1006\n\n+508=1514\n\n+783=2297\n\n+461=2758\n\n+484=3242\n\n+780=4022\n\n+822=4844\n\n+668=5512\n\n+121=5633.\n\nSo total importance is 5633.\n\nIs there a way to get higher? Perhaps by swapping some items. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the next items after C85: B39 is the last, but we can't fit it.\n\nAlternatively, after B09, can we add any other items? The next in line is B21, which is 882, too big. B93 is 793, also too big. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I can drop some lower priority items to include higher ones.\n\nFor example, the total effort is 3470. Remaining is 3629-3470=159. Is there an item that can fit into 159?\n\nLooking back, the items after C85 are B39 (842), which is too big. So no, nothing else can be added.\n\nSo perhaps 5633 is the maximum I can get with this approach.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can exclude some lower priority items to include higher ones.\n\nFor example, if I drop B09 (698 effort, importance 668) and C85 (226, 121), perhaps I can include something else.\n\nThe effort saved would be 698+226=924. So I can add items totaling up to 924.\n\nLooking for items that can fit 924.\n\nWhat's the next item after B09 in the priority list? B21 (882). 882 is within 924, so I can add B21. Then effort remaining 924-882=42, which isn't enough for any other items.\n\nSo total effort would be 2546 (after B33) +882=3428, which leaves 3629-3428=201. But the next item after B21 is B93 (793), which is too big.\n\nSo let me compare:\n\nOption 1: B09 (698) + C85 (226) gives importance 668+121=789, effort 924.\n\nOption 2: B21 (882) gives importance 808, effort 882.\n\nOption 2 gives higher importance (808 vs 789), so it's better.\n\nSo let me recalculate:\n\nAfter B33, effort=2546. Remaining=3629-2546=1083.\n\nInstead of B09 and C85, take B21 (882). So effort=2546+882=3428. Importance=4844+808=5652.\n\nRemaining effort=3629-3428=201. No items can be added except perhaps B39, which is 842, too big.\n\nSo total importance=5652, which is higher than the previous 5633.\n\nThis is better.\n\nSo I can adjust the set to include B21 instead of B09 and C85.\n\nSo the items are A11, A21, A82, C08, B20, A60, B31, B33, B21. Effort total: let's check:\n\n21+5+87+313+230+287+761+842+882.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n21+5=26\n\n+87=113\n\n+313=426\n\n+230=656\n\n+287=943\n\n+761=1704\n\n+842=2546\n\n+882=3428.\n\nYes, 3428, under 3629. Importance:868+138+508+783+461+484+780+822+808= let's add:\n\n868+138=1006\n\n+508=1514\n\n+783=2297\n\n+461=2758\n\n+484=3242\n\n+780=4022\n\n+822=4844\n\n+808=5652.\n\nSo that's better.\n\nSo perhaps this is a better set.\n\nWait, but can I do even better? Let's see.\n\nAfter adding B21, can I use the remaining 201 effort anywhere else? The only item left is B39, which is 842, too big. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can replace some lower priority items with others. For example, perhaps exclude B20 and include both B21 and something else.\n\nWait, B20 is effort 230, importance 461. Let's see.\n\nIf I remove B20 (230) and replace it with B21 (882). Wait, that might not work because 882 is larger than 230, and I might not have enough effort.\n\nWait, current effort without B20: After adding up to B33 (2546), then B21 (882) = 3428. So total effort is 3428, with items A11, A21, A82, C08, A60, B31, B33, B21. Then, can I add B20? No, because effort would be 3428+230=3658, which exceeds 3629.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I exclude A60 (287) and include B20 and B21. Let's check:\n\nIf I remove A60 (287) and add B20 (230) and B21 (882). So net effort change: -287 +230+882= +825, which would make total effort 2546 (up to B33) +230+882= 2546+1112=3658, which is over. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace A60 and B09 with B21 and others.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me see if 5652 is the best I can do.\n\nWait, another approach: let me include B93. Because B93 has high importance (583) but lower priority.\n\nBut perhaps combining items differently can give higher total.\n\nWait, let me see the total without including A11. Is that possible? Probably not, because A11 has the highest importance per effort.\n\nAlternatively, if I exclude A11, I can include more items, but the total importance would drop.\n\nNo, I think it's essential to include A11.\n\nSo, I think the set that includes up to B21 and excluding B09 and C85 is better, giving 5652.\n\nWait, but what if I can include both B21 and B09? Their total effort is 882+698=1580. But I already have 2546, which plus 1580 is 4126, which exceeds 3629. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can drop some items to fit more in. For example, if I drop A82 (87) and C08 (313), that's 400, and include B21 and B93. Let me check:\n\nIf I have A11, A21, B20, A60, B31, B33, B21, B93. Wait, let me calculate effort:\n\n21+5+230+287+761+842+882+793.\n\n21+5=26\n\n+230=256\n\n+287=543\n\n+761=1304\n\n+842=2146\n\n+882=3028\n\n+793=3821.\n\nTotal effort=3821. Effort remaining=3629-3821= -192. Over. So no.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include B93 instead of other items.\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. I think the best approach is to stick with the initial priority list and make adjustments where possible, like swapping B09 and C85 for B21, which gives a higher total.\n\nSo the proposed set is A11, A21, A82, C08, B20, A60, B31, B33, B21. That's total effort 3428, with total importance 5652.\n\nWait, let me check the effort again:\n\nA11:21\n\nA21:5\n\nA82:87\n\nC08:313\n\nB20:230\n\nA60:287\n\nB31:761\n\nB33:842\n\nB21:882\n\nAdding these: 21+5=26; +87=113; +313=426; +230=656; +287=943; +761=1704; +842=2546; +882=3428.\n\nYes, 3428.\n\nCan I include any more items? 3629-3428=201, nothing else fits.\n\nSo this seems to be a good set.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to include B93? To include B93, I need to remove some items. For example, perhaps remove C08 (313) and B20 (230), which frees up 543. Then I can add B93 (793). But 543 < 793, so can't do. Alternatively, remove both B20 and C08 and maybe A60 to include B93. Let's see:\n\nRemoving B20 (230), C08 (313), and A60 (287) is 230+313+287=830. Add B93 (793). So total effort saved:830-793=37.\n\nThen, perhaps I can include B21 as before.\n\nBut this would require recalculating the total.\n\nI think it's better to stick with the initial selection as swapping might not yield a higher total.\n\nSo, I'll propose the set {\"A11\", \"A21\", \"A82\", \"C08\", \"B20\", \"A60\", \"B31\", \"B33\", \"B21\"}.\n\nThis gives a total effort of 3428, which is under the limit, and total importance of 5652.\n",

                    "content": "Okay, so I'm in this negotiation game where I need to figure out the best set of items to agree on with another player. The goal is to maximize my own total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 3629. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. We've both got a list of items, each with an effort value and an importance value. The efforts are known to both of us, but the importance values are private. So, I know how much each item matters to me, but I don't know how much it matters to the other player, and vice versa.\n\nThe interaction is structured where we can propose sets of items, accept, refuse, or argue. Each message needs to follow a specific format with tags like PROPOSAL, ARGUMENT, etc. The game ends when both agree on a proposal. My task is to come up with a proposal that benefits me the most while staying within the effort limit.\n\nFrom the previous messages, the user proposed a set of items: {\"A11\", \"A21\", \"A82\", \"C08\", \"B20\", \"A60\", \"B31\", \"B33\", \"B21\"}. Then the user tried to argue but made a mistake with the format and had to correct it. The correct argument was explaining why those items were chosen based on high importance relative to effort.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to respond. The user's argument made sense in selecting items with high importance for them, but I need to consider my own strategy. Since I don't know the opponent's importance, I have to focus on my own.\n\nSo, perhaps I should analyze each item's importance to effort ratio for myself to prioritize. Items that give me a lot of importance without using too much effort would be ideal. I should list out each item and calculate importance per unit effort to see which ones are most efficient for me.\n\nLet me list out all items with their effort and my importance:\n\n- A21: Effort 5, Importance 138 \u2192 138/5 = 27.6\n- B93: Effort 793, Importance 583 \u2192 ~0.736\n- A11: Effort 21, Importance 868 \u2192 ~41.333\n- B33: Effort 842, Importance 822 \u2192 ~0.976\n- C08: Effort 313, Importance 783 \u2192 ~2.506\n- B39: Effort 842, Importance 65 \u2192 ~0.077\n- B96: Effort 631, Importance 262 \u2192 ~0.411\n- C85: Effort 226, Importance 121 \u2192 ~0.536\n- A82: Effort 87, Importance 508 \u2192 ~5.839\n- B31: Effort 761, Importance 780 \u2192 ~1.025\n- B20: Effort 230, Importance 461 \u2192 ~2.0\n- A60: Effort 287, Importance 484 \u2192 ~1.684\n- B09: Effort 698, Importance 668 \u2192 ~0.958\n- C81: Effort 641, Importance 389 \u2192 ~0.607\n- B21: Effort 882, Importance 808 \u2192 ~0.919\n\nLooking at these ratios, the highest ones are A11 (~41.33), A21 (27.6), A82 (~5.839), C08 (~2.506), B20 (~2.0), and to a lesser extent, B31 (~1.025), B93 (~0.736), B09 (~0.958), C81 (~0.607), B21 (~0.919). Items with the lowest ratios are B39 and B96.\n\nSo, from my perspective, the most efficient items in terms of importance per effort are A11 and A21. These seem crucial to include because they give a lot of importance with minimal effort. Next, A82 is important but consumes more effort, but given its high importance, it's probably worth considering. C08 and B20 are also good because their importance per effort is quite high.\n\nNow, considering the effort limit is 3629. Let me calculate the total effort of the initial proposal made by the user:\n\n- A11:21, A21:5, A82:87, C08:313, B20:230, A60:287, B31:761, B33:842, B21:882.\n\nAdding up the efforts: 21+5=26; +87=113; +313=426; +230=656; +287=943; +761=1704; +842=2546; +882=3428. So total effort is 3428, which is under 3629.\n\nNow, I need to see my total importance from these items:\n\nA11:868, A21:138, A82:508, C08:783, B20:461, A60:484, B31:780, B33:822, B21:808.\n\nAdding these up: 868+138=1006; +508=1514; +783=2297; +461=2758; +484=3242; +780=4022; +822=4844; +808=5652. So my total importance is 5652.\n\nBut is this the best I can do? Maybe I can find a combination that gives me higher total importance without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nLooking back, perhaps swapping some items could make the total importance higher. Let's see if any items not in the proposal have a higher importance than those included, and whether we can swap them without exceeding effort.\n\nIn the proposal, A60 (importance 484) and B33 (importance 822) are included. Let's see other items: C85 (121), B96 (262), B09 (668), etc. Are these higher or lower than what's in the proposal?\n\nLooking at B09 has 668 importance, which is higher than A60's 484. So maybe swapping B09 into the proposal would help. Let's see:\n\nIf I remove A60 (287 effort) and include B09 (698 effort), the effort difference would be 698 - 287 = +411. So the total effort was 3428, adding 411 would make it 3839, which is still under 3629? Wait, no. 3428 + 411 = 3839, but the limit is 3629. So that's over. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swapping multiple items. Let's see, maybe taking out both A60 and another low-importance item to include B09. Let's check the total.\n\nA60 is 287 effort and 484 importance. If I remove A60 (287), to include B09 (698), the extra effort needed is 698 - 287 = 411. To compensate, I need to remove other items that save at least 411 effort. For example, remove B31 (761 effort, 780 importance). If I remove B31, I save 761 effort but lose 780 importance. Then adding B09 gives +698 effort and +668 importance. So the net change would be -761 + 698 = -63 effort, and -780 + 668 = -112 importance. So effort goes down, but importance also decreases. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace B33 (842 effort, 822 imp) and A60 (287, 484) with B09 (698, 668) and something else. Let's see: removing B33 saves 842, removing A60 saves 287, so total saved effort is 1129. Adding B09 takes 698, so I have 1129 - 698 = 431 effort left to spend. Maybe add another item. What's left is B93 (793), which is too much as 698 + 793 > 1129. Alternatively, trying other items.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complex. Maybe it's better to look at all items sorted by their importance to me, and try to include as many high-importance items as possible.\n\nBut I have to balance with effort. So perhaps using a greedy algorithm approach, picking the highest importance items first without exceeding the effort.\n\nLet me list all items in order of my importance descending:\n\n1. A11:868\n2. B31:780\n3. B33:822 (Wait, B33 is actually 822, which is higher than B31's 780. So I think I made a mistake earlier.)\n\nWait, let me sort correctly:\n\nItem and my importance:\n\n- A11: 868\n- B33: 822\n- B31:780\n- B21:808 \u2192 Wait, 808 is higher than 780, so B21 is higher than B31.\nWait, I need a proper sorted list:\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\nFrom highest to lowest importance:\n\n1. A11: 868\n2. B33:822\n3. B21:808\n4. B31:780\n5. A60:484\n6. A21:138\n7. B20:461\n8. C08:783\n9. A82:508\n10. B09:668\n11. C81:389\n12. B93:583\n13. B96:262\n14. B39:65\n15. C85:121\n\nWait, hold on, this is wrong. I think I confused the order. To correctly sort, starting from highest:\n\n- A11:868\n- B33:822\n- B21:808\n- B31:780\n- C08:783\n- A82:508\n- B20:461\n- B09:668\n- A60:484\n- B93:583\n- C81:389\n- B96:262\n- A21:138\n- C85:121\n- B39:65\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me make a proper list:\n\nFrom the initial data:\n\nItem importance values = {\n\"A21\": 138,\n\"B93\": 583,\n\"A11\": 868,\n\"B33\": 822,\n\"C08\": 783,\n\"B39\": 65,\n\"B96\": 262,\n\"C85\": 121,\n\"A82\": 508,\n\"B31\": 780,\n\"B20\": 461,\n\"A60\": 484,\n\"B09\": 668,\n\"C81\": 389,\n\"B21\": 808\n}\n\nSo sorted by importance:\n\n1. A11: 868\n2. B33:822\n3. B21:808\n4. B31:780\n5. C08:783\n6. B93:583\n7. B09:668\n8. A82:508\n9. B20:461\n10. A60:484\n11. C81:389\n12. B96:262\n13. A21:138\n14. C85:121\n15. B39:65\n\nSo with this order, I need to pick items starting from the top, making sure the total effort doesn't exceed 3629.\n\nStart with A11 (868 imp, 21 effort). Total effort so far:21.\n\nNext, B33 (822,842). Adding 842 would make total effort 21+842=863.\n\nNext, B21 (808,882). 863+882=1745.\n\nNext, B31 (780,761). 1745+761=2506.\n\nNext, C08 (783,313). 2506+313=2819.\n\nNext, B93 (583,793). Adding this would bring effort to 2819+793=3612, which is under 3629. So include B93.\n\nNext, B09 (668,698). 3612+698=4310 >3629. Can't include.\n\nSo, total items so far: A11,B33,B21,B31,C08,B93. Let's check effort:21+842=863+882=1745+761=2506+313=2819+793=3612. Total effort 3612.\n\nImportance:868+822+808+780+783+583 = 868+822=1690+808=250, maybe miscalculation. Let me add properly:\n\n868 (A11)\n+822 = 1690 (A11,B33)\n+808 = 250, wait, 1690+808=2498\n+780 = 3278 (B31)\n+783 = 4061 (C08)\n+583 = 4644 (B93)\n\nSo total importance is 4644.\n\nEffort used:3612, remaining effort:3629-3612=17. We have remaining effort 17, can we add any more items? The next highest importance is B09 (668,698), which needs 698 effort, more than 17. So no.\n\nIs this a better proposal? Compare with the initial proposal:\n\nThe initial proposal had effort 3428 and importance 5652 as I calculated earlier. This new set has effort 3612, importance 4644, which is worse for me. Wait, but in the initial proposal, I got 5652 importance, which is higher than 4644. So the initial proposal is better for me. But maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Because in my initial calculation of the user's proposal, I added up the importance as 5652, which seems higher than the 4644 in my new proposal. So the initial proposal is better for me.\n\nWait, perhaps I did the wrong thing by following the effort. Maybe I should prioritize importance, not effort. But considering effort, the initial proposal is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial proposal is not the maximum I can get. Let me check that.\n\nLet me try another approach: choosing items with the highest importance to me regardless of effort, as long as the total effort is under 3629.\n\nLet me try starting from the top:\n\nA11 (868,21) \u2192 total:868, effort:21\n\nAdd B33 (822,842) \u2192 total imp:868+822=1690, effort:21+842=863\n\nAdd B21 (808,882) \u2192 imp:250, effort:1745\n\nAdd B31 (780,761) \u2192 imp:3278, effort:2506\n\nAdd C08 (783,313) \u2192 imp:4061, effort:2819\n\nAdd B09 (668,698) \u2192 imp:4061+668=4729, effort:2819+698=3517\n\nThat's still under 3629. Can I add anything else? Next item is A82 (508,87). Adding would bring effort to 3517+87=3604. Importance:4729+508=5237.\n\nStill under 3629. Then add B20 (461,230). That's 3604+230=3834 >3629. Can't add. Next, A60 (484,287). 3604+287=3891 >3629. No. Then B93 (583,793). Adding that is too much. C81 (389,641). Also too much. B96 (262,631). Still too much. A21 (138,5). Can add, but will that help? Let's see:\n\nCurrent set: A11,B33,B21,B31,C08,B09,A82.\n\nEffort total:3604. Adding A21: effort 3604+5=3609. Importance 5237+138=5375.\n\nThat's better. Let's check if any other items can be added without exceeding effort.\n\nWait, in the above step, after adding A82, we had 3604, and we can only add up to 3629, so remaining 25. A21 is 5, so yes, adding it would get to 3609, and we have 20 left. If there's any other item that can use 20 or less, but from the remaining items, B39 (842) is too big, C85 (226) same. None else under 20. So that's the best we can do.\n\nSo the proposal would be A11, B33, B21, B31, C08, B09, A82, A21.\n\nTotal imp:868+822=1690+808=2500+780=3280+783=4063+668=4731+508=5240, wait, no, let me recount:\n\nA11:868\n\nB33:822 \u2192 1690\n\nB21:808 \u2192 2498\n\nB31:780 \u2192 3278\n\nC08:783 \u2192 4061\n\nB09:668 \u2192 4729\n\nA82:508 \u2192 5237\n\nA21:138 \u2192 5375\n\nEffort:21+842=863+882=1745+761=2506+313=2819+698=3517+87=3604+5=3609.\n\nNow, the total effort is 3609, which is under 3629, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo my proposal is {\"A11\", \"B33\", \"B21\", \"B31\", \"C08\", \"B09\", \"A82\", \"A21\"}\n\nImportance:5375, effort:3609.\n\nCompare to the initial proposal, which gave me 5652 importance and effort 3428. So that initial proposal was better for me, but how did I get 5652?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in adding. The initial proposal included A11, A21, A82, C08, B20, A60, B31, B33, B21. Let's recount the importance:\n\nA11:868\n\nA21:138\n\nA82:508\n\nC08:783\n\nB20:461\n\nA60:484\n\nB31:780\n\nB33:822\n\nB21:808\n\nAdding these:\n\n868+138=1006\n\n+508=1514\n\n+783=2297\n\n+461=2758\n\n+484=3242\n\n+780=4022\n\n+822=4844\n\n+808=5652. Correct.\n\nEffort:21+5=26+87=113+313=426+230=656+287=943+761=1704+842=2546+882=3428. Correct.\n\nSo that's another possible set with higher importance but lower effort. How is that possible? Maybe the initial proposal includes more items with lower effort but still high importance.\n\nWait, in that proposal, A21 is included but uses only 5 effort for 138 importance. That's a good deal. So perhaps in addition to high-importance items, including low-effort items is beneficial.\n\nSo, perhaps trying to include as many high-importance and low-effort items as possible would yield a higher total.\n\nSo, perhaps I should include A21 (effort 5) early on because it's a high return for such low effort.\n\nSo, let's try making a proposal that includes A11, A21, A82, C08, B33, B21, B31, B20, A60, etc., as per the initial proposal, which gives me 5652 importance with 3428 effort.\n\nThis seems better than my alternative proposals.\n\nBut perhaps we can tweak it to include more high-importance items.\n\nWait, in the initial proposal, after including all these items, the effort is 3428, leaving 201 effort unused (3629-3428=201). Maybe we can add another item within that limit.\n\nLooking at the remaining items: the ones not included are B96 (effort 631), B93 (793), B39 (842), C85 (226), B09 (698), B21 was included, etc.\n\nWait, B09 is not included yet. To add B09, effort is 698, which is more than 201. So can't. B93 is 793, same issue. C85 is 226, which needs 226, and we have 201 left. So can't. B96 is 631>201.\n\nIs there any item we can add without exceeding? Let's see: A21 is already included. B09, C85, etc., are too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace some lower importance items with higher ones that fit within the remaining effort.\n\nFor example, in the initial proposal, the items with the lowest importance are A21 (138), B20 (461), and A60 (484). Maybe we can replace A21 and another with higher importance items within the effort.\n\nBut A21 uses only 5 effort; replacing it would require an item with more effort but higher importance than 138. For instance, perhaps replacing A21 and B20 (230) with B09 (698). Let's see:\n\nEffort saved:5 (A21) +230 (B20)=235.\n\nEffort needed:698 (B09). 235 saved vs. 698 needed: net increase 463. Current effort is 3428; adding 698-235=463 \u2192 3428+463=3891, which is over 3629. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe removing A60 (287) and A21 (5) to add B09 (698): 287+5=292. B09 is 698, so net increase 698-292=406. 3428+406=3834>3629. Still too high.\n\nAlternatively, removing B31 (761) and A21 (5), and adding B09 (698) and something else. Wait, that would save 761+5=766, add 698, net change -68. Maybe add something else like B93 (793) but that's too much.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe the initial proposal is the best I can get without the other player making changes. Alternatively, perhaps offering to remove some items and add others that benefit me more.\n\nBut since I don't know the opponent's priorities, it's tricky. They might value different items higher. For example, if they value B33 or B21 highly, they might not want to exclude those.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to stick with maximizing my own importance. Given that the initial proposal gives me a high importance, I might want to accept it or use it as a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a counter-proposal that includes even more of my high-importance items.\n\nWait, another idea: check if including B09 and removing some lower-importance items would help. Since B09 has high importance (668 for me), maybe it's worth including.\n\nIn the initial proposal, the items with the lowest importance are A21 (138), B20 (461), and A60 (484). Let's see if swapping them with B09 would help.\n\nSuppose I remove A21 (138,5) and B20 (461,230) \u2192 total effort saved:5+230=235, importance lost:138+461=599.\n\nAdd B09 (668,698). So effort needed:698. Effort change: 698-235=463 added. Total effort would go from 3428 to 3428+463=3891>3629. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, remove A60 (484,287) and A21 (138,5): effort saved 292, importance lost 622. Adding B09 would cost 698, net change +406, leading to 3428+406=3834>3629.\n\nNot feasible. Maybe remove more items. Like A60, A21, and B20 (total effort saved 287+5+230=522). Add B09 (698) and maybe another item.\n\nEffort used:698. Remaining effort: 522-698= -176 (can't, so actual added is 698, but total effort would be 3428+698=4126. Too high.\n\nAlternatively, no, maybe I need to approach differently.\n\nPerhaps it's best to stick with the initial proposal, as it's the most beneficial to me, and try to push for it, arguing that it's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider making a proposal that includes all the high-importance items within the effort limit, but I think the initial proposal is the best I can do for now.\n",
