            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation. I need to maximize my own total importance while ensuring the total effort doesn't exceed 3683. \n\nFirst, I should list out all the items with both their effort and my importance. Maybe I can sort them based on importance per effort to prioritize which items to take. Let me calculate the importance per effort ratio for each item.\n\nStarting with Item A21: 138 importance for 548 effort. That's roughly 0.25. B93: 583/154 is about 3.78. That seems high. A11: 868/60 is about 14.47, which is really high. B33: 822/517 around 1.59. C08: 783/334 is about 2.35. B39: 65/542 is 0.12. B96: 262/707 is 0.37. C85: 121/139 is 0.87. A82: 508/661 is 0.77. B31: 780/780 is 1. B20: 461/832 is 0.55. A60: 484/913 is 0.53. B09: 668/219 is about 3.05. C81: 389/323 is 1.20. B21: 808/638 is about 1.27.\n\nSo, sorting them by the ratio, from highest to lowest:\n\n1. A11 (14.47)\n2. B93 (3.78)\n3. B09 (3.05)\n4. C08 (2.35)\n5. B33 (1.59)\n6. B21 (1.27)\n7. B31 (1.00)\n8. C81 (1.20)\n9. A21 (0.25)\n10. B20 (0.55)\nWait, I think I might have miscalculated the order. Let me list them properly:\n\n- A11: 868/60 = 14.47\n- B93: 583/154 ≈ 3.78\n- B09: 668/219 ≈ 3.05\n- C08: 783/334 ≈ 2.35\n- B33: 822/517 ≈ 1.59\n- B21: 808/638 ≈ 1.27\n- C81: 389/323 ≈ 1.20\n- B31: 780/780 = 1.00\n- A82: 508/661 ≈ 0.77\n- C85: 121/139 ≈ 0.87\n- B20: 461/832 ≈ 0.55\n- A60: 484/913 ≈ 0.53\n- B96: 262/707 ≈ 0.37\n- A21: 138/548 ≈ 0.25\n- B39: 65/542 ≈ 0.12\n\nSo, the top items I want to get are A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, C81, B31, etc. But considering the effort, I need to make sure the total doesn't exceed 3683.\n\nBut the other person's preferences are unknown, so I have to propose a set that they might agree to. Maybe I should start by taking the highest importance items for me but also look at the effort.\n\nWait, the limit is 3683. Let me see what total effort the top items would take.\n\nA11 is 60 effort. Adding B93: 60+154=214. Then B09: 214+219=433. Then C08: 433+334=767. Then B33: 767+517=1284. Next B21: 1284+638=1922. Then C81: 1922+323=2245. Then B31: 2245+780=3025. Next, A82: 3025+661=3686. That's over by 3. So, can't include A82. So up to B31 gives 3025, which is under.\n\nBut wait, when considering that, the total effort would be 3025 with items A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, C81, B31. What's the total importance? Let's add them up.\n\nA11:868 + B93:583=1451. +B09:668=2119. +C08:783=2902. +B33:822=3724. +B21:808=4532. +C81:389=4921. +B31:780=5701. That's 5701 total importance.\n\nBut if we include all these items, the effort is 3025, leaving 3683-3025=658 effort remaining. Maybe I can include another item within that. Let's check which items have effort less than or equal to 658.\n\nLooking at the remaining items, after the top 8, the next is A82 with 661, which is just under 658? No, 661 is over. So maybe C85:139, but that's too small. Maybe A21:548, but that would add over the limit.\n\nWait, 3025 +548=3573, which is still under 3683. So adding A21 would bring effort to 3573. But let me check the effort: 60+154+219+334+517+638+323+780+548. Let me calculate:\n\n60+154=214; +219=433; +334=767; +517=1284; +638=1922; +323=2245; +780=3025; +548=3573. Yes, that's correct. So total importance would be 5701 +138=5839.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C85:139. Adding that would total effort 3025+139=3164. Then adding A21:3164+548=3712, which is over the limit.\n\nAlternatively, could we replace an item with a higher importance per effort? Let me see. Instead of adding A21, maybe there's a better combination.\n\nWait, but I don't know the other person's priorities. Perhaps I should make a proposal that includes the high importance for me but is also attractive for them. Maybe I can suggest a set and see their response.\n\nLet me try a proposal that includes A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, C81, B31, and A21. The total effort is 3573. It's under the limit. The total importance is quite high for me, but maybe the other person would accept because it's a good combination. Or perhaps they have other priorities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider items that are high for both of us, but I don't know their importance. So I have to rely on my own.\n\nSo maybe start with a strong proposal and see their reaction.\n"

The other participant has their own importance values, but I don't know what they are, so I have to base my decisions solely on my own priorities.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the items with their respective efforts and my importance values to get a clear picture.\n\nItem | Effort | My Importance\n-----|--------|-------------\nA21  | 548   | 138\nB93  | 154   | 583\nA11  | 60    | 868\nB33  | 517   | 822\nC08  | 334   | 783\nB39  | 542   | 65\nB96  | 707   | 262\nC85  | 139   | 121\nA82  | 661   | 508\nB31  | 780   | 780\nB20  | 832   | 461\nA60  | 913   | 484\nB09  | 219   | 668\nC81  | 323   | 389\nB21  | 638   | 808\n\nLooking at this, I notice that some items have high importance but also high effort. I need to balance between including high-importance items without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nI should consider the efficiency of each item, which is the importance per unit of effort. Maybe prioritizing items with higher efficiency will help maximize my total importance.\n\nCalculating efficiency (Importance/Effort):\n\nItem | Efficiency\n-----|----------\nA11  | 868/60 ≈14.47\nB93  | 583/154≈3.79\nC85  | 121/139≈0.87\nB09  | 668/219≈3.05\nC08  | 783/334≈2.34\nB33  | 822/517≈1.59\nB21  | 808/638≈1.27\nA21  | 138/548≈0.252\nB39  | 65/542≈0.119\nB96  | 262/707≈0.371\nA82  | 508/661≈0.769\nB31  | 780/780=1.0\nB20  | 461/832≈0.554\nA60  | 484/913≈0.530\nC81  | 389/323≈1.205\n\nFrom this, A11 is by far the most efficient, followed by B93, C85, B09, and so on. So starting with the highest efficiency makes sense.\n\nLet me try selecting items starting from the top:\n\n1. A11 (Effort:60, Importance:868) Total Effort:60, Total Imp:868\n2. B93 (154,583) Total Effort:214, Imp:1451\n3. C85 (139,121) Total Effort:353, Imp:1572\n4. B09 (219,668) Total Effort:572, Imp:2240\n5. C08 (334,783) Now, Effort would be 906, which is under 3683. Imp:2240+783=3023\n6. B33 (517,822) Adding this brings effort to 1423, Imp:3023+822=3845\n7. B21 (638,808) Effort:1423+638=2061, Imp:3845+808=4653\n8. B31 (780,780) Effort:2061+780=2841, Imp:4653+780=5433\n9. A21 (548,138) Effort:2841+548=3389, Imp:5433+138=5571\n10. B39 (542,65) Effort:3389+542=3931, Imp:5571+65=5636\n11. B96 (707,262) Effort:3931+707=4638, Imp:5636+262=5898\n12. A82 (661,508) Effort:4638+661=5299, Imp:5898+508=6406\n13. B20 (832,461) Over the limit if added, so stop here.\n\nNow, total effort is 5299, and importance is 6406.\n\nIs this the maximum? Maybe I can check if substituting some lower efficiency items with higher importance but higher effort could yield a better total.\n\nFor example, if I drop A21 (effort 548, imp 138) and add another item, perhaps C81 (effort 323, imp 389). Let me see.\n\nCurrent total effort without A21:5299-548=4751\n\nAdding C81:4751+323=5074, which is within limit. Importance becomes 6406-138+389=6657, which is an improvement.\n\nSo now, the set is:\n\nA11, B93, C85, B09, C08, B33, B21, B31, A82, B20, C81\n\nEffort:5074, Imp:6657\n\nIs there a way to improve further? Maybe replacing some lower efficiency items.\n\nLooking at the current set, the items with the lowest efficiencies are C85 and A21 (which I've already removed). C85 has very low efficiency, so maybe I can remove it and add something else.\n\nRemoving C85 (effort 139, imp 121). Now, total effort:5074-139=4935, Imp:6657-121=6536.\n\nNow, can I add another item? Let's see. The next most efficient available item not in the set is A60 (effort 913, imp 484). Adding it would bring effort to 4935+913=5848, which is under the limit. Importance becomes 6536+484=7020.\n\nSo set becomes: A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, B31, A82, B20, C81, A60\n\nEffort:5848, Imp:7020\n\nStill room for more, perhaps. What's left? B39 and B96.\n\nB39 is effort 542, imp 65. Not very efficient. B96 is effort 707, imp 262. Let's try adding B96:\n\nEffort:5848+707=6555, which is within the limit. Imp:7020+262=7282.\n\nSet: A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, B31, A82, B20, C81, A60, B96\n\nEffort:6555, Imp:7282\n\nTotal effort remaining:3683-6555 is negative, so that's over the limit. Wait, no, the limit is 3683. Wait, no, I think I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, the limit is 3683. So my previous totals were incorrect because I was thinking the limit was higher, but actually it's 3683. So I need to adjust.\n\nWait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate the current set:\n\nIf the limit is 3683, then the previous selection I had at 5074 is way over the limit. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the limit.\n\nWait, the LIMIT is 3683. So when I was adding items, I went way over that. So I need to select a set with total effort ≤3683.\n\nSo let's start fresh. My initial approach was to include the most efficient items until I reach the limit.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. A11:60,868 → Total Effort:60, Imp:868\n2. B93:154,583 → Total:214, Imp:1451\n3. B09:219,668 → Total:433, Imp:2119\n4. C08:334,783 → Total:767, Imp:2902\n5. B33:517,822 → Total:1284, Imp:3724\n6. B21:638,808 → Total:1922, Imp:4532\n7. B31:780,780 → Total:2702, Imp:5312\n8. C81:323,389 → Total:3025, Imp:5701\n9. A60:913,484 → Adding this would make 3025+913=3938 >3683, so cannot add.\n\nSo up to here, the total effort is 3025, and imp is 5701. What's left? A82 (661,508) and B20 (832,461). Both would exceed the limit if added.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swapping some items to include higher importance items.\n\nLet me check if swapping B31 (effort780, imp780) with A60 (913,484) and another item.\n\nIf I remove B31 (effort780, imp780), the total effort becomes 3025-780=2245, imp5701-780=4921.\n\nThen I can add A60 (913,484) and check if there's room.\n\n913 is less than 3683-2245=1438. So adding A60: total effort 2245+913=3158, imp 4921+484=5405.\n\nNow, remaining effort:3683-3158=525. What else can be added?\n\nC81 is already in. Let's see, B96:707 is too big. B39:542, which is over 525. Maybe B20:832 is too big. B09 is already in.\n\nWait, maybe adding B96 isn't possible. So maybe A60 alone is added, and total imp is lower than before. So perhaps better to keep B31.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps removing B31 and C81 (total effort780+323=1103, imp780+389=1169). Then adding A60 (913,484) and see if there's room left.\n\nNew effort:3025-1103=1922, imp5701-1169=4532.\n\nAdd A60:1922+913=2835, imp4532+484=5016.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-2835=848.\n\nNow, can I add B31 (780,780)? 2835+780=3615, which is within limit. Imp5016+780=5796.\n\nSo set becomes: A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, A60, B31.\n\nEffort:2835+780=3615, Imp:5796.\n\nIs there any more room? 3683-3615=68. No items have effort ≤68, as the smallest is C85:139. So we can't add anything else.\n\nComparing to when I had B31 and C81, which gave 5701 imp. So which is better? 5701 vs 5796. The second set gives higher importance.\n\nSo perhaps the set A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, A60, B31 is better, with imp5796.\n\nWait, but I think I miscalculated. Let me recheck:\n\nWhen I removed B31 (780) and C81 (323), that's 1103. Then added A60 (913) and B31 (780), which is 913+780=1693, which is more than the removed 1103, because I'm adding 1693-1103=590 extra, but that's not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's try to include A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, and then see what else can fit.\n\nTotal effort so far:60+154+219+334+517+638= 60+154=214+219=433+334=767+517=1284+638=1922.\n\nEffort remaining:3683-1922=1761.\n\nNow, from the remaining items, which have the highest importance.\n\nLooking at B31:780,780 → fits as 780 ≤1761. Adding it, now effort used:1922+780=2702, imp total:868+583=1451+668=2119+783=2902+822=3724+808=4532+780=5312.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-2702=981.\n\nNext, can we add C81 (323,389). 323 ≤981. Add it. Effort:2702+323=3025, imp5312+389=5701.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3025=658.\n\nWhat's left: A60 (913) is too big, A82 (661), which is also over 658. B20 (832), B96 (707), both over. B39 (542), which is within 658, but imp is only 65. C85 (139,121), but even adding it, total effort becomes 3025+139=3164, imp5701+121=5822. Then remaining effort:3683-3164=519. Maybe add B39:542, but 542>519. So no.\n\nAlternatively, instead of adding C81, maybe adding other items. For example, A82 is 661, which is more than 658, so can't add. B20 is 832, too big. B96 is 707, too big. So the best after B31 is C81.\n\nAlternatively, removing some items. For instance, C08 has effort 334 and imp 783. What if I remove it and see what else I can add.\n\nTotal effort without C08:1922-334=1588, imp4532-783=3749.\n\nThen, with remaining effort:3683-1588=2095.\n\nNow, adding C08 was giving me 783 imp, but maybe replacing it with other items.\n\nBut 2095 is a lot. Let's see: A60 (913), B31 (780), A82 (661), B20 (832), etc.\n\nIf I add A60: effort913, imp484. Then effort used:1588+913=2501, imp3749+484=4233.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-2501=1182.\n\nAdd B31 (780,780): effort780 ≤1182, total effort:2501+780=3281, imp4233+780=5013.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3281=402.\n\nAdd B20 (832) is too big, B96 (707) too big. C81 (323,389):323 ≤402, add it. Effort:3281+323=3604, imp5013+389=5402.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3604=79.\n\nCannot add anything else. So total imp is 5402, which is less than the previous 5701. So it's worse.\n\nTherefore, better to keep C08 and C81.\n\nSo the set A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, B31, C81 gives total imp5701, effort3025, within the limit.\n\nIs there a way to improve this?\n\nLet me see if I can include A60 instead of any lower imp item. For example, if I remove C81 (323,389) and add A60 (913,484). But 913 is larger than 323, so I have to adjust.\n\nWhen I remove C81, the effort reduces by 323, giving me room to add more. But adding A60 would need 913, which is 590 more than the space created. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, remove B31 (780,780) and C81 (323,389) to save 1103 effort, then add A60 (913,484) and see what else can fit.\n\nSo new effort after removal:3025-1103=1922, imp5701-1169=4532.\n\nAdd A60 (913,484): effort1922+913=2835, imp4532+484=5016.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-2835=848.\n\nWhat can I add? B31 (780,780) can fit. Effort2835+780=3615, imp5016+780=5796.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3615=68. Nothing to add.\n\nSo total imp5796, which is better than 5701.\n\nTherefore, this is a better set: A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, A60, B31.\n\nEffort:3615, Imp:5796.\n\nIs there any way to get higher? Let me check.\n\nWhat if I remove B33 (effort517, imp822) and replace it with something else.\n\nCurrent set without B33: effort3615-517=3098, imp5796-822=4974.\n\nPossible additions: B33 is out, so let's see what's left: A82 (661,508), C85 (139,121), B39 (542,65), B96 (707,262), B20 (832,461), etc.\n\nWhat's the best item to add? A82:508 imp for 661 effort. So adding A82, effort3098+661=3759, imp4974+508=5482.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3759=-76. Over. So can't add.\n\nAlternatively, add B96 (707,262). Effort3098+707=3805>3683. Can't add.\n\nAlternatively, add C85 (139,121). Effort3098+139=3237, imp4974+121=5095.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3237=446.\n\nWhat else? A82:661>446. B39:542>446. B96:707>446. B09 is already in. So nothing. So imp5095, worse than 5796.\n\nSo better to keep B33.\n\nIs there another way? Maybe remove C08 (effort334, imp783) and add A82 and something else.\n\nSet without C08: effort3615-334=3281, imp5796-783=5013.\n\nAdd A82:661, imp508. Effort3281+661=3942>3683. Over. Can't.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the best I can get.\n\nWait, what if I remove B21 (effort638, imp808) and see if adding other items can compensate.\n\nCurrent effort without B21:3615-638=2977, imp5796-808=4988.\n\nPossible additions: B21 is out. What else? B33 is in, B31 is in.\n\nCan I add A82 (661,508)? 2977+661=3638, which is under 3683. Imp4988+508=5496.\n\nThen, remaining effort:3683-3638=45. Can't add anything. So imp5496, which is less than 5796.\n\nSo better to keep B21.\n\nTherefore, the set A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, A60, B31 seems to be the best with imp5796.\n\nAlternatively, check if removing B09 (effort219, imp668) and adding another item could help.\n\nSet without B09: effort3615-219=3396, imp5796-668=5128.\n\nWhat can I add: A60 is already in, B31 is in.\n\nAdd B96 (707,262). Effort3396+707=4103>3683. No.\n\nAdd A82 (661,508). Effort3396+661=4057>3683. No.\n\nAdd B20 (832,461). 3396+832=4228>3683. No.\n\nAdd B39 (542,65). Effort3396+542=3938>3683. No.\n\nSo can't add anything else without exceeding. So imp5128, which is worse than 5796.\n\nThus, keeping B09 is better.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps swap B31 (780,780) with B20 (832,461) and C81 (323,389).\n\nTotal effort after swapping: 832+323=1155 vs B31's 780. So net change:1155-780=375 more effort, which would require removing 375 from elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps remove C08 (334) to add B20 and C81. Let's see:\n\nTotal effort:3615 -334=3281.\n\nAdd B20 (832) and C81 (323): effort3281+832+323=3436, which is under 3683. Imp5796 -783 (from C08) +461 (B20) +389 (C81)=5796-783=5013 +461+389=5863.\n\nThat's better! So now the set is A11, B93, B09, B33, B21, A60, B31, B20, C81.\n\nEffort:3436, Imp5863.\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3436=247. Maybe add B39 (542) but it's too big, or C85 (139,121). So adding C85: effort3436+139=3575, imp5863+121=5984.\n\nNow, remaining effort:3683-3575=108. Nothing to add.\n\nSo this set gives imp5984, which is better than 5796.\n\nWait, but does this set fit? Let me list the items:\n\nA11 (60), B93 (154), B09 (219), B33 (517), B21 (638), A60 (913), B31 (780), B20 (832), C81 (323), C85 (139).\n\nTotal effort:60+154=214+219=433+517=950+638=1588+913=2501+780=3281+832=4113+323=4436+139=4575.\n\nWait, that's over 3683. So I must have miscalculated.\n\nWait, when adding B20 (832), A60 (913), let's recalculate:\n\nA11:60\n\nB93:154 → 214\n\nB09:219 → 433\n\nB33:517 → 950\n\nB21:638 → 1588\n\nA60:913 → 2501\n\nB31:780 → 3281\n\nB20:832 → 4113\n\nC81:323 → 4436\n\nC85:139 → 4575\n\nTotal effort4575 >3683. So that's over the limit. Therefore, this set is invalid.\n\nSo perhaps adding C85 is too much. Let me try without C85.\n\nSet: A11, B93, B09, B33, B21, A60, B31, B20, C81.\n\nEffort:60+154=214+219=433+517=950+638=1588+913=2501+780=3281+832=4113+323=4436.\n\n4436>3683. So that's over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of adding C81, add something else.\n\nWait, after adding B20, the effort is 4113 which is over. So I cannot add anything else. So perhaps it's not a valid set.\n\nSo maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try a different strategy.\n\nAlternatively, what if I include A21 (effort548, imp138) instead of something else? Maybe it's not worth it because its efficiency is low, but sometimes including it might allow other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should stick with the set that gives me 5796 without going over the limit.\n\nWait, let me list the items in the set A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, A60, B31.\n\nEffort:\n\nA11:60\n\nB93:154 → 214\n\nB09:219 → 433\n\nC08:334 → 767\n\nB33:517 →1284\n\nB21:638 →1922\n\nA60:913 →2835\n\nB31:780 →3615\n\nTotal effort:3615. Under 3683.\n\nImp:868+583=1451+668=2119+783=2902+822=3724+808=4532+484=5016+780=5796.\n\nThat seems solid. Now, is there any way to squeeze in one more item?\n\nRemaining effort:3683-3615=68. No item has effort ≤68 except maybe none. So no.\n\nAlternatively, can I swap any item with a higher importance one without exceeding effort?\n\nFor example, remove C08 (effort334, imp783) and add A82 (661,508) and C85 (139,121).\n\nSo effort saving:334.\n\nAdding effort:661+139=800. Which is 466 more than 334. So total effort becomes 3615-334+800=4081>3683. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, remove B33 (effort517, imp822) and add A82 (661,508). Effort difference:661-517=144 added. So total effort becomes3615+144=3759>3683. Slightly over.\n\nAlternatively, remove C08 and B33, but that would save 334+517=851, and add A82 (661) and something else. 851-661=190 saved. Can I add something else? Maybe C81 (323,389). But 323>190, so total effort:3615-851+661+323=3615-851=2764+661=3425+323=3748>3683. Over.\n\nAlternatively, remove B31 (780,780), which frees up 780, and add A82 (661) and C85 (139). Total effort:780-661-139= -120, so total effort becomes 3615-780+661+139=3615-780=2835+661=3496+139=3635, which is under. Imp:5796-780=5016 +508+121=5645.\n\nBut 5645 is less than 5796, so worse.\n\nTherefore, it's better to keep the original set.\n\nSo final proposal: A11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, A60, B31.\n\nEffort:3615, which is under 3683. Importance:5796.\n\nI think that's the best I can do without exceeding the limit.\n"

            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this negotiation problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, let's understand the setup. I'm in a game with another participant, and we need to agree on a set of items to keep. The catch is that each item has an effort value, and the total effort of the selected items can't exceed 3683. \n\nI have my own importance scores for each item, and the other participant has theirs, which I don't know. The goal is to select a set of items that maximizes my total importance without exceeding the effort limit. The challenge is to negotiate this set with the other participant, making use of structured messages like PROPOSAL, REFUSE, ARGUMENT, and AGREE.\n\nLooking back at my previous attempts, I realize I made a couple of mistakes. First, I didn't include the ARGUMENT structure in my initial proposal, and then I used an unstructured narrative which wasn't allowed. I need to stick strictly to the formats provided: TAG followed by a colon and a Python set containing the relevant items or arguments.\n\nIn my second attempt, I included the ARGUMENT, but I still used some narrative text before the structured formats, which was unnecessary and against the rules. I should avoid adding any extra text and ensure each message only contains the required structures without any additional explanations or reasoning outside of the ARGUMENT tag.\n\nSo, my strategy should focus on creating a proposal that maximizes my total importance while staying within the effort limit. I'll start by evaluating each item based on the ratio of its importance to me versus its effort. Items with a higher importance relative to their effort are more valuable and should be prioritized.\n\nLooking at the item data:\n\nItem effort and my importance:\n\n- A21: Effort 548, Importance 138 → Ratio 0.252\n- B93: Effort 154, Importance 583 → Ratio 3.79\n- A11: Effort 60, Importance 868 → Ratio 14.47\n- B33: Effort 517, Importance 822 → Ratio 1.587\n- C08: Effort 334, Importance 783 → Ratio 2.347\n- B39: Effort 542, Importance 65 → Ratio 0.12\n- B96: Effort 707, Importance 262 → Ratio 0.37\n- C85: Effort 139, Importance 121 → Ratio 0.87\n- A82: Effort 661, Importance 508 → Ratio 0.768\n- B31: Effort 780, Importance 780 → Ratio 1\n- B20: Effort 832, Importance 461 → Ratio 0.554\n- A60: Effort 913, Importance 484 → Ratio 0.53\n- B09: Effort 219, Importance 668 → Ratio 3.05\n- C81: Effort 323, Importance 389 → Ratio 1.20\n- B21: Effort 638, Importance 808 → Ratio 1.266\n\nSorting these by the ratio in descending order:\n\n1. A11: 14.47\n2. B93: 3.79\n3. B09: 3.05\n4. C08: 2.347\n5. B33: 1.587\n6. B21: 1.266\n7. C81: 1.20\n8. B31: 1\n9. A82: 0.768\n10. B20: 0.554\n11. A60: 0.53\n12. C85: 0.87 (Wait, this seems out of order. C85 ratio is 0.87, which is lower than C81's 1.20)\n13. B96: 0.37\n14. A21: 0.252\n15. B39: 0.12\n\nSo, correct sorted order by ratio descending:\n\n1. A11 (14.47)\n2. B93 (3.79)\n3. B09 (3.05)\n4. C08 (2.347)\n5. B33 (1.587)\n6. B21 (1.266)\n7. C81 (1.20)\n8. B31 (1)\n9. C85 (0.87)\n10. A82 (0.768)\n11. B20 (0.554)\n12. A60 (0.53)\n13. B96 (0.37)\n14. A21 (0.252)\n15. B39 (0.12)\n\nNow, the strategy is to pick items starting from the top until the total effort doesn't exceed the limit.\n\nCalculate cumulative effort:\n\n- Start with A11: 60\n- Add B93: 60 + 154 = 214\n- Add B09: 214 + 219 = 433\n- Add C08: 433 + 334 = 767\n- Add B33: 767 + 517 = 1284\n- Add B21: 1284 + 638 = 1922\n- Add C81: 1922 + 323 = 2245\n- Add B31: 2245 + 780 = 3025\n- Now, considering the next item, C85: 3025 + 139 = 3164 (within limit)\n- Next, A82: 3164 + 661 = 3825 (exceeds 3683, so skip)\n- Next, B20: let's see if adding B20 instead of C85 would help. But wait, B20 has effort 832, which is higher than C85's 139. So, maybe not.\n- Alternatively, after B31 (total 3025), perhaps replace C85 with A82, but that would exceed the limit. So, include C85: total 3164\n- Next item, A82: can't add, as it exceeds\n- Next, B20: can't add\n- Next, A60: 913, too much\n- B96: 707, too much\n- A21: 548, 3164 +548=3712, which is less than 3683? No, 3164+548=3712 which is over.\nWait, 3164 +548 = 3712 which is 29 over the limit, so can't add\nB39: 542, 3164+542=3706, also over\nSo, after including up to C85, total effort is 3164, and we have some room left: 3683-3164=519\n\nLooking back, perhaps we can swap some lower ratio items with higher ones that use the remaining effort better.\n\nWait, C85 is already included at 139, giving us a total of 3164. Remaining effort is 519. Maybe we can swap some lower ratio items with higher ones.\n\nLooking at the current set:\n\nA11, B93, B09, C08, B33, B21, C81, B31, C85\n\nTotal effort: 60+154+219+334+517+638+323+780+139= Let's verify:\n\n60+154=214\n\n214+219=433\n\n433+334=767\n\n767+517=1284\n\n1284+638=1922\n\n1922+323=2245\n\n2245+780=3025\n\n3025+139=3164\n\nYes, correct. Remaining effort: 3683-3164=519\n\nIs there a way to use this 519 more effectively? Let's see. From the excluded items, are there any that have higher importance than the ones included, especially those that could be swapped in without exceeding?\n\nLooking at the excluded items beyond C85:\n\nA82: importance 508, effort 661 (but 519 left, can't add)\nB20: 461, 832 (too much)\nA60:484, 913 (too much)\nB96:262,707\nA21:138,548 (548>519)\nB39:65,542 (can we swap B39 in place of something?)\n\nBut B39 has a very low importance for me, so including it would lower my total. So, maybe it's better not to include lower importance items just to use up effort.\n\nAlternatively, could I remove some lower ratio items to include a higher one? For example, if I remove B31 (effort 780, importance 780), which has a ratio of 1, and use the freed effort to add something else. But B31 is in the current set, and removing it frees up 780, which is more than the remaining 519. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps see if adding another high-importance item can fit within the remaining effort. Looking at items we haven't included yet:\n\nA82: 508 importance, 661 effort (can’t fit)\nB20: importance 461, 832 (no)\nA60:484,913 (no)\nB96:262,707 (no)\nA21:138,548 (can't fit as 548>519)\nB39:65,542 (could fit as 542>519? No)\nWait, 542 is more than 519, so can't fit.\n\nSo, perhaps C85 is the last one we can add without going over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a combination that allows us to include more high-importance items. Let me think differently.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that uses the effort more efficiently. Perhaps by swapping out some items that are in the set with lower ratios for others not in the set with higher ratios, as long as the total effort doesn't exceed.\n\nWait, but according to the sorted list, the included items are the top 9 by ratio, so adding any of the remaining would have lower ratios. So, perhaps the current set is the most efficient.\n\nBut let's check the total effort: 3164, leaving 519 unused. Maybe I can see if any of the not included items have higher importance than some included, despite their lower ratios. Because importance is per item, not necessarily per unit effort.\n\nBut that's a bit tricky because it's about maximizing total importance, not necessarily the ratio. So maybe some items with lower ratio but higher absolute importance could be included by swapping.\n\nFor example, B33 has importance 822 with effort 517 (ratio 1.587). If I can swap it with another item that has higher importance, but without exceeding the effort.\n\nWait, items not included yet:\n\nA82:508, which is lower than B33's 822\nB20:461\nA60:484\nB96:262\nA21:138\nB39:65\n\nSo none of these have higher importance than B33 except maybe A82 (508<822). So swapping B33 for A82 would require removing 517 and adding 661, which increases effort by 144, which would put us over the limit (3164+144=3308, which is within 3683). Wait, but B33 is in the set, so if I remove B33 (effort 517), I can add A82 (661). So let's see:\n\nCurrent total effort without B33: 3164-517=2647\n\nAdding A82: 2647+661=3308, which is under the limit.\n\nNow, my total importance would be: current total minus B33's 822 plus A82's 508.\n\nWhich is 822-508=314 less. So that's worse for me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps swapping B33 and another item? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Check if including a higher importance item that wasn't included before can be added by removing lower importance ones.\n\nLet me calculate the total importance so far.\n\nIncluded items:\n\nA11:868\nB93:583\nB09:668\nC08:783\nB33:822\nB21:808\nC81:389\nB31:780\nC85:121\n\nAdding these up: 868+583=1451; +668=2119; +783=2902; +822=3724; +808=4532; +389=4921; +780=5701; +121=5822.\n\nWait, that seems high, but okay.\n\nNow, total importance is 5822.\n\nIf I could add another high-importance item within the remaining effort, it would increase my total. But as we saw earlier, the remaining effort is 519, and no remaining items have effort less than that except perhaps B39 (effort 542, which is over). So no addition is possible without exceeding the limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps swapping a lower importance item for a higher one outside the current set.\n\nBut all the items not in the current set have lower importance than the ones included, so swapping would lower my total.\n\nTherefore, the current set is the best possible to maximize my total importance.\n\nSo, my proposal would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A11', 'B93', 'B09', 'C08', 'B33', 'B21', 'C81', 'B31', 'C85'}\n\nAnd I should include an ARGUMENT to justify why this is a good proposal, emphasizing the high importance of the included items and the balance with effort.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous attempt, maybe I can include A60 by removing some items. Let's check.\n\nA60 has effort 913 and importance 484. If I remove, say, C08 (effort 334, importance 783) and C81 (323,389) and B31 (780,780), that's too much. It's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remove B31 (780) to include A60 (913). That would add 913-780=133 to the effort, which would still keep within the limit because 3164-780=2384 +913=3297, which is under 3683. However, B31 has higher importance for me (780) than A60 (484), so swapping would decrease my total importance by 296. Not ideal.\n\nSimilarly, removing B21 (effort 638, importance 808) to include A60 (913,484). The effort would be 3164-638=2526 +913=3439, which is within limit. But importance would decrease by 808-484=324. Not good.\n\nSo, it's better to stick with the current set.\n\nTherefore, my final proposal and argument would be structured as follows.\n"
