                    "content": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.\n\nFirst, the goal is to select a set of items that maximizes my personal importance while keeping the total effort within the limit of 2307. The other participant has their own importance values, which I don't know, so I have to base my decisions purely on my own data and the effort costs.\n\nLet me list out all the items with their effort and my importance to get a clearer picture.\n\nItems:\nA21: Effort 147, Importance 138\nB93: Effort 698, Importance 583\nA11: Effort 588, Importance 65\nB33: Effort 43, Importance 262\nC08: Effort 356, Importance 121\nB39: Effort 80, Importance 508\nB96: Effort 95, Importance 461\nC85: Effort 743, Importance 484\nA82: Effort 106, Importance 668\nB31: Effort 308, Importance 389\nB20: Effort 325, Importance 215\nA60: Effort 255, Importance 97\nB09: Effort 276, Importance 500\nC81: Effort 543, Importance 30\nB21: Effort 51, Importance 400\n\nLooking at these, I notice that some items have high importance but also high effort. My strategy should be to prioritize items that give me the highest importance per unit effort since that will maximize my total within the limit.\n\nI'll start by calculating the importance-to-effort ratio for each item. This will help me see which items are more valuable for me relative to their cost.\n\nCalculations:\nA21: 138/147 \u2248 0.938\nB93: 583/698 \u2248 0.835\nA11: 65/588 \u2248 0.110\nB33: 262/43 \u2248 6.093\nC08: 121/356 \u2248 0.340\nB39: 508/80 = 6.35\nB96: 461/95 \u2248 4.853\nC85: 484/743 \u2248 0.652\nA82: 668/106 \u2248 6.302\nB31: 389/308 \u2248 1.263\nB20: 215/325 \u2248 0.662\nA60: 97/255 \u2248 0.380\nB09: 500/276 \u2248 1.812\nC81: 30/543 \u2248 0.055\nB21: 400/51 \u2248 7.843\n\nFrom this, B33, B39, B21, and A82 have the highest ratios. But I need to check if including them alone doesn't exceed the effort limit and how they can be combined optimally.\n\nLet me rank them by this ratio:\n\n1. B21: 7.843\n2. B39: 6.35\n3. B33: 6.093\n4. A82: 6.302\nWait, actually, B33 and B39 are the top two. Let's correct the order:\n\n1. B21: 7.843\n2. B39: 6.35\n3. B33: 6.093\n4. A82: 6.302 (Wait, 6.302 is higher than 6.093, so correct order after B21 is B39, then A82, then B33)\n\nWait, let me list them in order:\n\n1. B21: 7.843\n2. B39: 6.35\n3. A82: ~6.302\n4. B33: ~6.093\n5. B96: ~4.853\n6. B31: ~1.263\n7. B20: ~0.662\n8. B93: ~0.835\nWait, B93 has a lower ratio, so it's actually lower than some others.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake in the sorting. Let me re-order properly.\n\nHere's the correct order from highest ratio to lowest:\n\n1. B21: ~7.843\n2. B39: 6.35\n3. A82: ~6.302\n4. B33: ~6.093\n5. B96: ~4.853\n6. B09: ~1.812\n7. B31: ~1.263\n8. B20: ~0.662\n9. C85: ~0.652\n10. B93: ~0.835 (Wait, 0.835 is higher than B20's 0.662, so it's actually 8th place.\n11. A21: ~0.938\n12. C08: ~0.340\n13. A60: ~0.38\n14. A11: ~0.110\n15. C81: ~0.055\n\nWait, perhaps I should reorganize this correctly:\n\nAfter calculating all ratios, the sorted list from highest to lowest is:\n\n1. B21 (7.843)\n2. B39 (6.35)\n3. A82 (6.302)\n4. B33 (6.093)\n5. B96 (4.853)\n6. B09 (1.812)\n7. B31 (1.263)\n8. B93 (0.835)\n9. B20 (0.662)\n10. C85 (0.652)\n11. A21 (0.938) \u2013 Wait, 0.938 is higher than 0.835, so it's actually after B20 but before C85? No, let me check:\n\nWait, A21: 138/147 \u2248 0.938\nC85: ~0.652, which is lower than A21.\n\nWait, no, 0.938 is higher than 0.835, which was B93's. So B93 is 0.835, and A21 is 0.938, so A21 would come after B93 but before B20.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me sort them correctly.\n\nLet me list all items with their ratios:\n\n- B21: 7.843\n- B39: 6.35\n- A82: 6.302\n- B33: 6.093\n- B96: 4.853\n- B09: 1.812\n- B31: 1.263\n- A21: 0.938\n- B93: 0.835\n- B20: 0.662\n- C85: 0.652\n- A60: 0.380\n- C08: 0.340\n- A11: 0.110\n- C81: 0.055\n\nSo in correct order:\n\n1. B21 (7.843)\n2. B39 (6.35)\n3. A82 (6.302)\n4. B33 (6.093)\n5. B96 (4.853)\n6. B09 (1.812)\n7. B31 (1.263)\n8. A21 (0.938)\n9. B93 (0.835)\n10. B20 (0.662)\n11. C85 (0.652)\n12. A60 (0.380)\n13. C08 (0.340)\n14. A11 (0.110)\n15. C81 (0.055)\n\nNow, my goal is to include as many of the top ratios as possible without exceeding 2307 effort.\n\nI should start by adding the highest ratio items first and see how much effort I use.\n\nLet me start adding items in this order and keep track of the total effort and total importance.\n\nFirst, add B21: effort 51, total effort 51, importance 400.\n\nNext, B39: effort 80, total effort 51+80=131, importance 400+508=908.\n\nNext, A82: effort 106, total effort 131+106=237, importance 908+668=1576.\n\nNext, B33: effort 43, total effort 237+43=280, importance 1576+262=1838.\n\nNow, next is B96: effort 95, total effort 280+95=375, importance 1838+461=2299.\n\nNext, B09: effort 276, total effort 375+276=651, importance 2299+500=2799.\n\nNext, B31: effort 308, total effort 651+308=959, importance 2799+389=3188.\n\nNext, A21: effort 147, total effort 959+147=1106, importance 3188+138=3326.\n\nNext, B93: effort 698, total effort 1106+698=1804, importance 3326+583=3909.\n\nNext, B20: effort 325, total effort 1804+325=2129, importance 3909+215=4124.\n\nWait, but the effort is only 2129, which is under 2307. So I can try to add more.\n\nNext, C85: effort 743, but adding that would make total effort 2129+743=2872, which exceeds the limit. So I can't include C85.\n\nNext, A60: effort 255, adding to 2129+255=2384, which is still under 2307? Wait, 2129+255=2384, which is over 2307 (2384-2307=77). So can't include A60.\n\nC08: 356. 2129+356=2485 >2307, no.\n\nA11: 588. Too big.\n\nC81: 543, also too big.\n\nSo the total effort up to B20 is 2129, with a remaining effort of 2307-2129=178.\n\nLooking for items that can fit into the remaining 178 effort.\n\nCheck next items in the list:\n\nAfter B20, the next in the list is C85 (743) which is too big, then A60 (255) which is also still too big because 2129+255=2384>2307. But wait, I have 178 remaining, so maybe I can replace some items with higher effort to include items that give higher importance with lower effort.\n\nWait, perhaps I can swap out some lower-importance items to include others.\n\nBut let me check the total so far: 4124 importance with 2129 effort.\n\nIs there a way to include more items or swap items to get higher importance without exceeding effort?\n\nWait, but the effort is 2129, and the limit is 2307, so 2307-2129=178 left. Can I find any items not yet included that have effort \u2264178 and add them?\n\nLooking through the remaining items:\n\nC85: 743 \u2013 no\nA60:255 \u2013 too big\nC08:356 \u2013 too big\nA11:588 \u2013 too big\nC81:543 \u2013 no\n...\n\nWait, the remaining items after B20 are only these, but their efforts are too high. So maybe I can't add any more items without exceeding the limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can replace some of the included items with others that have lower effort but still contribute significantly to importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe including a different combination would allow a higher total importance.\n\nWait, maybe including B93 (effort 698, imp 583) vs including multiple smaller items. Let's see: including B93 adds 583 importance with 698 effort, but perhaps including other items in place might be better.\n\nLet me recalculate the proposed set:\n\nCurrent selection: B21, B39, A82, B33, B96, B09, B31, A21, B93, B20.\n\nWait, but that seems like 10 items, which seems okay. Let me sum up their efforts:\n\nB21:51, B39:80, A82:106, B33:43, B96:95, B09:276, B31:308, A21:147, B93:698, B20:325.\n\nWait, adding these: 51+80=131; +106=237; +43=280; +95=375; +276=651; +308=959; +147=1106; +698=1804; +325=2129. Correct.\n\nTotal importance: 400+508+668+262+461+500+389+138+583+215 = Let's add step by step:\n\n400+508=908; +668=1576; +262=1838; +461=2299; +500=2799; +389=3188; +138=3326; +583=3909; +215=4124.\n\nYes, 4124.\n\nIs there a way to increase this further? Maybe by substituting lower-value items.\n\nLet me see if I can replace some lower ratio items with higher ones, maybe even if they have a slightly higher effort.\n\nLooking at the included items, the ones with the lowest ratios in the current set are B93 (0.835), A21 (0.938), B20 (0.662), and B31 (1.263). So perhaps replacing the lower ones with better ones.\n\nWait, let's think: what's the lowest ratio in the current set? Probably B20 at 0.662, then B93 at 0.835, then B31 at 1.263, and then A21 at 0.938.\n\nIf I can remove B20 (effort 325, imp 215) and see if I can add any combination of items that have higher importance and effort \u2264325.\n\nWhat's the next item in the sorted list after B20? C85 (too big), but beyond that, A60 (255, which is less than 325). Adding A60: effort 255, imp 97. But 97 is less than the 215 from B20. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can remove B20 and see if I can add other items within the 325 effort.\n\nBut since the effort limit is 2307, and currently at 2129, if I remove B20 (effort 325), I have 2129-325=1804, and then can add up to 2307-1804=503 effort.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The total effort was 2129, which includes B20's 325. If I remove B20, the total becomes 2129-325=1804, and I have 2307-1804=503 effort left. So I can add items with total effort up to 503.\n\nLooking at the remaining items not included yet: C85 (743), A60 (255), C08 (356), A11 (588), C81 (543), etc.\n\nWait, C08 has effort 356, which is within 503. If I add C08, effort 356, imp 121. Then I have 503-356=147 remaining. Can I add another item with \u2264147 effort? A21 is already included, effort 147, but in this scenario, I'm considering replacing B20 with C08 and perhaps another item.\n\nWait, but if I remove B20 and add C08, the effort becomes 1804 + 356 = 2160, and I have 2307-2160=147 left. The remaining items not included: C85, A60, etc. A60 is 255, which is over, A21 is already included, so perhaps nothing else can be added. So total importance would be 4124 - 215 (B20) + 121 (C08) = 4124 -215 +121 = 4124 -94 = 4030. That's less than before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a combination of items that use up 503 effort and give higher importance than 215.\n\nFor instance, A60 and C08: A60 (255) + C08 (356) = 611 >503. No good. Alternatively, A60 (255) + something else. But what's left? B93 is already included. Wait, no, in this scenario, we're removing B20 and seeing what to add. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider whether excluding some of the lower ratio items and including others could yield a higher total.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps include the top 5 or 6 items and see if that frees up effort for more items.\n\nTop 5 items by ratio:\n\nB21, B39, A82, B33, B96, B09, B31, etc.\n\nWait, but when I include the top items, their total effort might leave little room.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different combination yields a higher total importance.\n\nWait, maybe including B93 is not the best move. Let's see: including B93 gives me 583 importance for 698 effort (0.835). Alternatively, could I replace B93 with other items that have higher ratios?\n\nSo, if I remove B93 (effort 698, imp 583), I have 698 effort freed up. What can I get with that?\n\nLooking back at the sorted list, after B20, the next items are C85 (743), which is too big, then A60 (255), which I could include. Including A60 gives me 97 importance, but that's much less than 583. So probably not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, I could include multiple smaller items. For example, after B20, I could include B09 (276 effort, 500 importance), but B09 is already included. Wait, in the current set, B09 is already included.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see what's the maximum I can get without including B93.\n\nIf I exclude B93, I have 2129-698=1431 effort, and I can use 2307-1431=876 effort more.\n\nWhat's the next highest ratio item not included? After the current set, the next is C85, but it's 743, which is under 876. So including C85 (743, imp 484). That would leave 876-743=133 effort, which can include B21 (51, but already included) or others. Alternatively, after including C85, I can't add any more within the limit.\n\nSo total importance would be 4124 -583 (B93) +484 (C85) = 4124-583=3541 +484=4025, which is less than 4124. So not better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe including C85 along with B93. But their combined effort is 698+743=1441 >2307. So can't do both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a set without B93 that allows more items. Let's try:\n\nStart with B21, B39, A82, B33, B96, B09, B31, A21, B20. That's 9 items with total effort 2129-698 (if I remove B93) = 1431? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach. Let me list all possible combinations, but that's time-consuming. Instead, perhaps I should stick with my current set.\n\nWait, another idea: check if including B93 is worth it. If I exclude B93 and include other items that can add more importance.\n\nSo, excluding B93 (remove 698 effort, add back 583 importance). Then, with 698 effort freed, what can I include? Let's see the next items in terms of ratio.\n\nAfter B20, the next item is C85 (743) which is too big, then A60 (255). Including A60 gives 97 importance, but that's way lower than what B93 gives.\n\nAlternatively, maybe include B31 (308, 389) and some other items. But in my current set, B31 is already included.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the current set I have is the best I can do. Let me calculate the total again: 4124 importance with 2129 effort.\n\nIs there any other combination that can give a higher importance without exceeding effort?\n\nAnother approach: check if any high-importance items that I haven't included yet can be added by removing some lower-importance items.\n\nWait, in my current set, the lowest importance items are A21 (138), B20 (215), B93 (583), but B93 is actually high. Wait, no, B93 has high importance. The lower ones are A21 (138), B20 (215).\n\nIf I can replace A21 and B20 with higher importance items, that would help. But their combined effort is 147+325=472. So I need to find items with total effort \u2264472 that give more than 138+215=353 importance.\n\nLooking for such items: Let's see, what's available? B09 (500, 276), which is already included. B96 (461,95) is included. B31 (389,308) is included. B33 (262,43) is included. B39 (508,80) included. Hmm, all the high ones are already included. So perhaps I can't replace A21 and B20 with higher importance.\n\nWait, maybe replace them with multiple items. Let me check:\n\nEffort available after removal: 472.\n\nPossible additions: C08 (356,121) and B21 (51,400). But B21 is already included.\n\nWait, perhaps including C08 and something else. If I include C08 (356) and then perhaps nothing else, as 472-356=116, which isn't enough for anything else except A21, but that's being removed.\n\nBut including C08 (121) and adding another item like B93, but wait, B93 is already included. Alternatively, perhaps not worth it because C08 only gives 121, which is less than A21's 138. So that's not beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a better combination. Perhaps include C85, but it's 743, which is over 472. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to keep A21 and B20 as they are, since replacing them doesn't yield a higher total.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial selection is the best I can do without further insight.\n\nWait, but let me see if I can include C85 by removing some lower importance items.\n\nC85 has effort 743, importance 484. If I can replace some items whose combined effort \u2265743 and total importance \u2264484, then I can swap.\n\nLooking for items in my current set with total effort \u2265743 and importance \u2264484.\n\nLooking at the current set, perhaps B93 alone: effort 698, importance 583. If I remove B93, I can include C85 (743). But C85's importance is 484 <583, so that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, remove B20 (325,215) and B93 (698,583) together: total effort 1023, and importance 798. Then, I can include C85 (743,484) and have 1023-743=280 effort left. What can I add with 280 effort?\n\nLooking for items with effort \u2264280. B31 (308) is over, so can't include. B09 (276,500) is available. So include B09: 276, which is within 280, giving 500 importance. So total added: C85 (484) + B09 (500) = 984. Removed: B20 (215) + B93 (583) = 798. So net gain: 984 -798=186 importance, and effort: 743+276=1019, which is within the limit as 1023 was the freed effort. Wait, but original effort was 2129. Removing B20 and B93 (total effort 325+698=1023) would leave 2307-1023=1284 effort. Adding C85 and B09 would take 743+276=1019, leaving 1284-1019=265 effort.\n\nBut in this case, the total effort is 1019, which is under 1284, so I can include more items. Let me see.\n\nWait, the total effort after removal is 2129 -1023=1106, and adding C85 and B09: 743+276=1019, so total becomes 1106 +1019=2125, which is under 2307. So effort remaining: 2307-2125=182. Can I include anything else? A21 (147) is already included. Wait, no, in this scenario, A21 was not removed.\n\nWait, no, in this case, I only removed B20 and B93, and added C85 and B09. So my total set would be: B21, B39, A82, B33, B96, B09, B31, A21, C85, and B93 removed, B20 removed, but B09 added. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me recast.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should stick with the original set.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if excluding B93 allows me to include other high-importance items.\n\nSo, in the original set, including B93 gives me 583. If I exclude B93, can I include C85 and others that sum up to more than 583?\n\nC85 is 484, so I need another 99 to make up 583. But the next item is A60:97, which would give 484+97=581, which is still less than 583. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, including C85 (484) and A60 (97) and perhaps another small item, but that would require more effort without enough gain.\n\nSo, perhaps including B93 is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to keep the original set.\n\nAnother idea: check the total effort and see if I can add any additional items without replacing.\n\nIn the original set, I have effort 2129, with 2307-2129=178 left.\n\nLooking for items not included yet with effort \u2264178.\n\nLooking at the items:\n\nA60:255 \u2013 too big\nC08:356 \u2013 too big\nA11:588 \u2013 too big\nC81:543 \u2013 too big\nOnly A21 is already included. No, the other items not included have higher effort. So I can't add any more.\n\nSo, the total remains at 4124 importance with 2129 effort.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a way to include more high-importance items by substituting lower ones, but I don't see a way without decreasing the total.\n\nThus, I think the best set is the one I have: B21, B39, A82, B33, B96, B09, B31, A21, B93, B20.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: is there a way to include more high-importance items?\n\nWait, let me calculate the effort:\n\nB21:51, B39:80 \u2192131\nA82:106 \u2192237\nB33:43 \u2192280\nB96:95 \u2192375\nB09:276 \u2192651\nB31:308 \u2192959\nA21:147 \u21921106\nB93:698 \u21921804\nB20:325 \u21922129.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me make a PROPOSAL with this set. But wait, I need to make sure it's exactly as the set.\n\nSo the proposal would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B21', 'B39', 'A82', 'B33', 'B96', 'B09', 'B31', 'A21', 'B93', 'B20'}\n\nBut wait, that's 10 items. Let me check the effort sum:\n\n51+80=131; +106=237; +43=280; +95=375; +276=651; +308=959; +147=1106; +698=1804; +325=2129. Correct.\n\nImportance sum:400+508+668+262+461+500+389+138+583+215= let's compute:\n\n400+508=908 \u2192 +668=1576 \u2192 +262=1838 \u2192 +461=2299 \u2192 +500=2799 \u2192 +389=3188 \u2192 +138=3326 \u2192 +583=3909 \u2192 +215=4124. Correct.\n\nSo, I think this is a strong proposal. Now, I need to also include an ARGUMENT.\n\nBut per the protocol, I must include an ARGUMENT in my message, so I can't just PROPOSE. Alternatively, perhaps I can submit the PROPOSAL now, but since the initial message from the system was empty, perhaps I should make the PROPOSAL first and then in a later message, ARGUE for it.\n\nWait, but the user just asked for a thought process, and the actual response needs to be a message following the protocol. So in the actual response, I can start by making the PROPOSAL and then perhaps include an ARGUMENT in the next message.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should include the ARGUMENT in the same message as the PROPOSAL.\n\nWait, no, the user is asking for the thought process, so I'll proceed to the formal answer.\n"

                    "content": "Alright, let's try to figure out the best approach for this negotiation. The goal is to maximize my total importance without exceeding the effort limit of 2307. The other participant proposed a set, but I need to come up with a better one that benefits me more.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the items with their importance and effort to get a clear picture. Maybe I can identify which items are high importance for me and low effort, which would be great to include. Also, I should check if the opponent's proposal is optimal or if I can tweak it to get a higher importance.\n\nLooking at my importance values, I notice that A82 has the highest importance (668), followed by B93 (583), B39 (508), B21 (400), B09 (500), B96 (461), and B31 (389). These are all high-value items for me. Now, I should check their effort values to see which ones can fit within the total limit.\n\nA82 has an effort of 106, which is manageable. B93 is 698, which is a bit high, but maybe worth it. B39 is 80, very low, so including it is a good idea. B21 is 51, also low. B09 is 276, B96 is 95, B31 is 308.\n\nLet me calculate the total effort if I include all these high-importance items:\n\nA82 (106) + B93 (698) + B39 (80) + B21 (51) + B09 (276) + B96 (95) + B31 (308).\n\nAdding these up: 106 + 698 is 804, plus 80 is 884, plus 51 is 935, plus 276 is 1211, plus 95 is 1306, plus 308 is 1614. That's well below the limit of 2307. So there's room to add more items.\n\nNext, I look at the next tier. Maybe adding A21 (effort 147, importance 138) and B33 (effort 43, importance 262). Adding these: 147 + 43 = 190, which brings the total to 1614 + 190 = 1804.\n\nStill under 2307. Then, perhaps adding B20 with effort 325 and importance 215. Adding that is 325, total becomes 1804 + 325 = 2129. Still under.\n\nNow, can I add more? Let's see. The remaining items are A11 (588), C08 (356), C85 (743), A60 (255), B09 is already included, C81 (543, but I have it in the previous proposal? Wait, no, in the initial list, C81 is 543. But in my current selection, I don't have it yet. So maybe adding C08, which is 356, effort. Adding that would bring the total to 2129 + 356 = 2485, which is over the limit.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove some lower importance items to include others. Maybe C08's importance is 121, which is lower than some others. So perhaps it's better to include higher importance items first.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the total effort:\n\nA82 (106) + B93 (698) = 804\n\nB39 (80) = 884\n\nB21 (51) = 935\n\nB09 (276) = 1211\n\nB96 (95) = 1306\n\nB31 (308) = 1614\n\nA21 (147) = 1761\n\nB33 (43) = 1804\n\nB20 (325) = 2129\n\nThat's all the items in the opponent's PROPOSAL. They're all included. Now, the total effort is 2129, which is under 2307. So there's room for more, perhaps, but maybe the opponent's PROPOSAL is already including their high-importance items, and I need to see if I can adjust it to include more of my high-importance items.\n\nBut I'm trying to maximize my own importance, not theirs. So maybe I should prioritize my own high-importance items, even if that means excluding some of theirs. For example, if I include A82, B93, B39, B21, B96, B09, B31, A21, B33, B20, and maybe add more items that are important to me but have low effort.\n\nWait, the effort so far is 2129. The remaining effort is 2307 - 2129 = 178. So I can add items up to 178 effort. What's left that I want? Let's see: A60 (255) is too much. C08 (356) is too much. C85 (743) is way too much. So maybe I can't add any more. Or perhaps swap some lower importance items with higher ones if possible.\n\nWait, maybe the opponent's PROPOSAL already includes items that are high for them but might not be optimal for me. Perhaps I can remove some lower priority items from their PROPOSAL and replace them with higher importance ones for me, without exceeding the effort.\n\nLooking at the opponent's PROPOSAL: {'B21', 'B39', 'A82', 'B33', 'B96', 'B09', 'B31', 'A21', 'B93', 'B20'}\n\nCalculating total effort: Let's check each item's effort and sum:\n\nB21:51, B39:80, A82:106, B33:43, B96:95, B09:276, B31:308, A21:147, B93:698, B20:325.\n\nLet's sum them step by step:\n\n51 +80 = 131\n\n131 +106 = 237\n\n237 +43 = 280\n\n280 +95 = 375\n\n375 +276 = 651\n\n651 +308 = 959\n\n959 +147 = 1106\n\n1106 +698 = 1804\n\n1804 +325 = 2129.\n\nSo total effort is 2129, which is correct.\n\nSo if I can, perhaps I can replace some items in this set that are low importance for me with others that are higher. For example, B20 has effort 325 and importance 215. Maybe I can remove it and add another item that has higher importance for me within the remaining effort.\n\nIf I remove B20 (325), the effort saved is 325. I can then look for items that I can add within 325. For example, A11 is 588, which is too big. C85 is 743, too big. C08 is 356, which is possible.\n\nSo removing B20 (325) and adding C08 (356) would require an effort of 356. But since I saved 325, I need to check if I have enough. 356 > 325, so it's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps I can add multiple smaller items.\n\nWait, but I can't remove B20 and add C08 because C08's effort is higher than the saved. Alternatively, maybe I can remove another item. Let's see.\n\nLooking for items in the current set that, if removed, would save effort and allow me to include higher importance items.\n\nFor example, A21 is 147 effort and 138 importance. What if I remove A21 and add someone else? Let's see, the effort saved is 147. Maybe I can add A60 (255) which is 255. 255 > 147, so that's not possible. Alternatively, add B33 is already included, so no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, B33 has 43 effort and 262 importance. That's a good ratio, so maybe keep that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can remove B20 (effort 325, importance 215) and instead add C85 (effort 743, which is too high) or maybe C08 (356). But 356 is still higher than 325, so I can't do that unless I remove more items.\n\nAlternatively, can I remove B20 and A21 (total effort saved: 325+147=472) and add C08 (356) and maybe C81 (543). Wait, 356+543=899, which is more than 472, so that's not possible. Maybe just add C08 and leave the rest.\n\nBut if I remove B20 and A21 (total effort 472), adding C08 (356) would leave 472-356=116 effort left. Then I can look for another item with <=116 effort. Let's see, perhaps B21 is already included. B33 is included. So nothing else left, maybe adding A82? No, already included. So maybe it's better to keep A21 and B20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the initial proposal because any swaps might not improve my total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial proposal is as good as I can get without knowing the opponent's priorities. But I can try to propose a different set that includes more of my high-importance items.\n\nWait, let me make a list of my items sorted by importance:\n\nMy importance from high to low:\n\nA82:668, B93:583, B39:508, B21:400, B09:500, B96:461, B31:389, A21:138, B33:262, B20:215, C08:121, A60:97, B33:262, A11:65, C81:30.\n\nLooking at effort:\n\nA82:106, B93:698, B39:80, B21:51, B09:276, B96:95, B31:308.\n\nSo perhaps the highest priority for me is A82, B93, B39, B21, B09, B96, B31. Let's see what their total effort is:\n\nA82:106, B93:698=804\n\nB39:80=884, B21:51=935, B09:276=1211, B96:95=1306, B31:308=1614.\n\nThat's 1614. Now, the limit is 2307, so I have 2307-1614=693 effort left.\n\nWhat items can I add with <=693?\n\nLooking at remaining items: B33 (43), A21 (147), B20 (325), C08 (356), A60 (255), C85 (743), A11 (588), etc.\n\nIf I add all of these: B33 (43), A21 (147), B20 (325), C08 (356). Let's calculate:\n\n43+147=190, 190+325=515, 515+356=871. That's under 693? No, wait, 871 is more than 693. So that's too much.\n\nSo, I have 693 left after the initial set. So which combination can I add to maximize my importance without exceeding.\n\nB33 (43) is good, then A21 (147), total so far 190.\n\nB20 (325): 190 +325=515, which is under 693.\n\nSo B33, A21, B20 adds 43+147+325=515, leaving 693-515=178.\n\nWhat else can I add with 178?\n\nC08 (356) is too big, A60 is 255, too big. So maybe B33, A21, B20, and then nothing else. Total effort: 1614 + 515=2129, same as before. So that's the same as the opponent's PROPOSAL.\n\nAlternatively, can I include C08 (356) by removing some items? Like, instead of B20 (325), I can remove B20 and add C08? But 356 is more than 325, so I can't. Alternatively, remove both B20 and another small item to make room.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B33 (43), A21 (147), C08 (356). Total is 43+147+356=546, which is within the remaining 693. Then the total effort would be 1614 + 546=2160, leaving 2307 -2160=147.\n\nBut then can't add more. So is this better for me?\n\nIn this scenario, my total importance would be:\n\nA82 (668) + B93 (583) + B39 (508) + B21 (400) + B09 (500) + B96 (461) + B31 (389) + B33 (262) + A21 (138) + C08 (121). Wait, but C08's importance is 121, which is lower than some others. Hmm, not sure if that's better.\n\nAlternatively, including B20 (215) instead of C08 would give higher importance. Because 215 >121. So maybe it's better to include B20 for more points.\n\nSo perhaps the initial set is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swap B20 (effort 325, importance 215) with C08 (356, importance 121). That would reduce my total importance by 215-121=94, which is a loss. So not good.\n\nAlternatively, swap B20 and A21 (138) for C08. But that's more effort. Not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps the initial PROPOSAL is as good as I can get for now. I need to see if I can include more high-importance items without exceeding the effort. But it seems that the current set uses up 2129 effort, leaving 178, which isn't enough for any other high-importance items except maybe B33 (43) and others, but they're already included.\n\nTherefore, I think the initial proposal is acceptable, but I might try to tweak it to include more of my high-importance items. Maybe I can include A82, B93, B39, B21, B96, B09, B31, A21, B33, B20, and maybe another item.\n\nWait, adding all of these gives exactly the PROPOSAL the opponent made. So perhaps that's the optimal for me, given the effort constraints.\n\nSo I think I should either AGREE to their proposal or make a different proposal that includes more of my high-importance items. But given the effort limit, I can't include more without removing something else.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a counter proposal by adding some items that the opponent might value more but are less important to me, but that's risky because I don't know their values.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to accept their proposal, as it includes most of my high-importance, high-effort items like B93 (effort 698, which is a big chunk but high importance for me, 583) and A82 (high importance, low effort). So the set seems well-rounded.\n\nTherefore, I'll agree to their proposal because it maximizes my total importance under the effort constraint.\n"

Each of us has our own importance scores for these items, but we can't see each other's. \n\nThe other player proposed a set: {'B21', 'B39', 'A82', 'B33', 'B96', 'B09', 'B31', 'A21', 'B93', 'B20'}. I agreed to it, but the system kept saying I didn't include an argument. I tried again, but maybe I'm not formatting it correctly.\n\nLet me check the interaction protocol again. The response needs to have the structured formats with the correct tags. I think I might have forgotten to include the ARGUMENT in the right place or forgot to make it a set with strings.\n\nI also realize that just agreeing without a proper argument isn't enough. I need to make sure that when I AGREE, I also include an ARGUMENT in the same message. Maybe I can AGREE and provide an ARGUMENT explaining why I'm accepting the proposal, highlighting the key items that benefit me.\n\nI should make sure my messages follow the structure strictly. So, in my next message, I need to include both AGREE and ARGUMENT, each with their own structured formats. That way, the system recognizes both actions correctly.\n\nI think I've got it now. Time to draft a proper response with both AGREE and ARGUMENT, ensuring all tags are correctly formatted as specified.\n"
