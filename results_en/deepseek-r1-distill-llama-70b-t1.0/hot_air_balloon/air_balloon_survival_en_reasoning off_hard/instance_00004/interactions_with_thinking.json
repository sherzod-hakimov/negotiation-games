                    "content": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nWe have a set of items, each with an effort value and importance value specific to me. The other participant has their own importance values, which I don't know. The goal is to agree on a set of items where the total effort doesn't exceed 2984. I need to maximize my own total importance without knowing what the other person values.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the items with their efforts and my importance values to see which ones are more valuable to me relative to their effort.\n\nLet me create a table to sort them by importance per effort. That might help prioritize which items to include.\n\nCalculating importance per effort for each item:\n\n- A21: 138 / 350 \u2248 0.394\n- B93: 583 / 276 \u2248 2.110\n- A11: 868 / 616 \u2248 1.408\n- B33: 822 / 737 \u2248 1.116\n- C08: 783 / 531 \u2248 1.474\n- B39: 65 / 389 \u2248 0.167\n- B96: 262 / 24 \u2248 10.916\n- C85: 121 / 125 \u2248 0.968\n- A82: 508 / 338 \u2248 1.503\n- B31: 780 / 356 \u2248 2.190\n- B20: 461 / 143 \u2248 3.223\n- A60: 484 / 117 \u2248 4.137\n- B09: 668 / 257 \u2248 2.598\n- C81: 389 / 921 \u2248 0.422\n- B21: 808 / 789 \u2248 1.024\n\nSorting by highest importance per effort:\n\n1. B96 (10.916)\n2. A60 (4.137)\n3. B20 (3.223)\n4. B09 (2.598)\n5. B31 (2.190)\n6. B93 (2.110)\n7. A11 (1.408)\n8. A82 (1.503)\n9. C08 (1.474)\n10. B33 (1.116)\n11. C85 (0.968)\n12. B21 (1.024)\n13. A21 (0.394)\n14. C81 (0.422)\n15. B39 (0.167)\n\nSo, B96 is extremely efficient. I should definitely include that if possible. Similarly, A60, B20, B09, etc., are high on the list.\n\nLet me calculate the total effort if I take the top few items:\n\nStart with B96 (24). Effort used:24, Remaining:2984-24=2960. My importance:262.\n\nNext, A60 (117). Total effort:24+117=141. Remaining:2984-141=2843. Importance:262+484=746.\n\nNext, B20 (143). Total effort:141+143=284. Remaining:2984-284=2700. Importance:746+461=1207.\n\nNext, B09 (257). Total effort:284+257=541. Remaining:2984-541=2443. Importance:1207+668=1875.\n\nNext, B31 (356). Total effort:541+356=897. Remaining:2984-897=2087. Importance:1875+780=2655.\n\nNext, B93 (276). Total effort:897+276=1173. Remaining:2984-1173=1811. Importance:2655+583=3238.\n\nNext, A11 (616). Total effort:1173+616=1789. Remaining:2984-1789=1195. Importance:3238+868=4106.\n\nNext, C08 (531). Total effort:1789+531=2320. Remaining:2984-2320=664. Importance:4106+783=4889.\n\nNext, B33 (737). But this would exceed the remaining effort (664). So can't take B33.\n\nNext, A82 (338). 2320+338=2658. Remaining:2984-2658=326. Importance:4889+508=5397.\n\nNow, I have 326 effort left. Let's see what can fit:\n\nLooking for items with effort \u2264326.\n\nLooking back at the list, next highest after A82 is C85 (125). 125 \u2264326. So include C85: total effort 2658+125=2783, remaining 201. Importance:5397+121=5518.\n\nNext, A21 (350) is too big. Next, B39 (389) also too big. B21 (789) too big. C81 (921) too big. So the remaining effort is 201, but no more items fit except B96, which we've already included.\n\nWait, B96 is only 24, but we've already included it. Are there any other small effort items? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, have I missed any items with effort \u2264201?\n\nLooking at the effort list:\n\nA21:350, B93:276, A11:616, B33:737, C08:531, B39:389, B96:24, C85:125, A82:338, B31:356, B20:143, A60:117, B09:257, C81:921, B21:789.\n\nSo, after including up to C85, the remaining effort is 201. The only small items left are:\n\n- B96 (24) already included.\n\nWait, any other small items? Let's see: the smallest is B96 at 24, then A60 (117), B20 (143), B09 (257), C85 (125), etc.\n\nSo in the remaining 201, perhaps B09 is 257, which is too big. C85 is already included. So maybe B20 is 143, but already included. A60 is 117, already included.\n\nSo perhaps the total effort so far is 2783, with importance 5518.\n\nIs there a way to include more items with higher importance per effort within the remaining 201?\n\nWait, maybe I can swap some items. For example, if I remove a lower importance per effort item to include others.\n\nFor example, if I remove C85 (125 effort, 121 importance) and see if I can add something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including B21 (789) is too big, but if I don't include A11 (616) and include B21, let's see.\n\nWait, let me recalculate without A11 and include B21.\n\nWait, let's retrace:\n\nAfter including up to B93 (276), the total effort is 1173, total importance 3238. Then I added A11 (616), effort now 1789, importance 4106.\n\nInstead of adding A11, could I add B21? B21's effort is 789, which when added to 1173 would be 1962, which is under 2984. Then I'd have:\n\nEffort: 1173+789=1962. Remaining: 2984-1962=1022.\n\nImportance:3238+808=4046.\n\nThen, with 1022 left, I can add:\n\nC08:531, which brings effort to 1962+531=2493, remaining 491.\n\nImportance:4046+783=4829.\n\nThen, A82:338. Remaining effort after that:2984-2493-338=153.\n\nImportance:4829+508=5337.\n\nBut wait, the remaining 153 could take B96 (24), but it's already included. Alternatively, B20 (143) is already included. So perhaps that's better? Let me check:\n\nAlternative path: After including B21, C08, A82, total effort:1962+531+338=2831. Remaining:2984-2831=153. So perhaps include A60 (117) if not already included. Wait, no, I think in this path, I didn't include A60 yet.\n\nWait, no, in this alternate path, I included B21 after B93, so earlier steps are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe the initial path is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including more high-importance items.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, building the proposal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a knapsack approach, trying to maximize importance without exceeding effort.\n\nBut that would take more time. Alternatively, since I'm not a computer, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nAnother approach: Start by selecting items with the highest importance per effort, adding them until I can't add more, then see if I can swap lower ones for higher ones.\n\nSo, starting with B96 (24, 262).\n\nThen A60 (117, 484). Total effort 141, imp 746.\n\nThen B20 (143, 461). Effort 284, imp 1207.\n\nThen B09 (257, 668). Effort 541, imp 1875.\n\nThen B31 (356, 780). Effort 897, imp 2655.\n\nThen B93 (276, 583). Effort 1173, imp 3238.\n\nThen A11 (616, 868). Effort 1789, imp 4106.\n\nThen C08 (531, 783). Effort 2320, imp 4889.\n\nThen A82 (338, 508). Effort 2658, imp 5397.\n\nNow, remaining effort: 2984-2658=326.\n\nCheck what's left: C85 (125, 121), which can be added. Effort becomes 2658+125=2783, imp 5518. Remaining effort: 201.\n\nNo more items fit, so total imp 5518.\n\nIs there a way to improve this? Maybe swap C85 (125,121) with something else.\n\nWait, what if I don't take C85 and instead take another item? But the remaining effort is 201, so let's see which items I haven't taken yet:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nB39 (389), C81 (921), A21 (350), B33 (737), B21 (789). All these have higher effort than 201. The only small one is C85 (125), which I included. So no better option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can remove a less efficient item to include more.\n\nFor example, perhaps remove C08 (531, 783) and see what else I can fit in the remaining effort.\n\nWait, if I remove C08 (531), then after A82, I have:\n\nEffort: 2658 -531=2127? Wait, no. Wait, in the previous steps, after adding A82, the effort is 2658, but if I remove C08, which was added before A82, so let me recalculate.\n\nWait, let me track:\n\nAfter adding B93, effort is 1173, imp 3238.\n\nInstead of adding A11 and C08, maybe add other items.\n\nAlternatively, after B93, adding B21 (789). So effort:1173+789=1962, imp:3238+808=4046.\n\nRemaining effort:2984-1962=1022.\n\nNow, can I add A11 (616). 1962+616=2578. Remaining:406.\n\nImportance:4046+868=4914.\n\nThen add C08 (531), but 2578+531=3109>2984, so can't. So maybe add A82 (338): 2578+338=2916. Remaining:68.\n\nImportance:4914+508=5422.\n\nThen, with 68 left, can I add B96 (24)? Already included. So total imp 5422.\n\nCompare to previous total of 5518. So 5422 is worse.\n\nSo initial path was better.\n\nAlternatively, after adding B21, add C08.\n\nWait, 1962 (B21) +531=2493. Remaining:491.\n\nImp:4046+783=4829.\n\nThen add A82 (338): 2493+338=2831. Remaining:153.\n\nImp:4829+508=5337.\n\nThen add B96 (24, already included). Still, 5337 is less than 5518.\n\nSo the initial path is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can include C08 instead of A82, but that's already done.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe swap A82 (338,508) with a combination of other items that free up effort.\n\nWait, 508 importance for 338 effort. Maybe remove A82 and use that 338 to include other higher importance items.\n\nBut with 338 effort, what can I include?\n\nLooking for items not yet included, with effort \u2264338.\n\nC85:125, which is already included. B20:143 included, A60:117 included, B09:257 included, B96:24 included, C08:531 too big, B33:737 too big, etc.\n\nSo perhaps swap A82 for another item, but I don't see a better option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can drop C85 and A82, and add B33 and C85.\n\nWait, not sure. Let me calculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should proceed with the initial proposal, which totals 5518 importance, and see if that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can include B33 (737,822). Let's see.\n\nIncluding B33 would require removing some items. Since B33's effort is 737, I need to see if I can swap it for some lower effort items.\n\nFor example, if I remove A11 (616,868) and C08 (531,783), which total effort 1147, and add B33 (737). Then:\n\nEffort saved:1147-737=410. Can I use that to add other items?\n\nWith the saved 410, perhaps add B31 (356,780). So:\n\nRemove A11 and C08: effort goes down by 1147, add B33 and B31: effort goes up by 737+356=1093. Net change: -1147 +1093= -54. So total effort:2658 (current total without A82 and C85) -1147 +1093 = 2658 -54=2604. Remaining effort:2984-2604=380.\n\nWait, no, this is getting complicated. Let me recast.\n\nOriginal selection after including up to A82: total effort 2658, imp 5397. Then I added C85: total effort 2783, imp 5518.\n\nIf I instead remove A11 (616) and C08 (531), and add B33 (737) and B31 (356), let's see:\n\nOriginal effort:2658.\n\nAfter removing A11 and C08: 2658 -616 -531=1511.\n\nAdding B33 and B31:1511 +737 +356=2604. Total effort:2604.\n\nRemaining:2984-2604=380.\n\nImportance: original imp after removing A11 and C08:5397 -868 -783=3746. Adding B33 and B31:3746 +822 +780=5348.\n\nCompare to original 5518. So 5348 is worse.\n\nSo that swap isn't beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nHmm. I'm starting to think that my initial selection is the best I can do, giving me a total importance of 5518.\n\nWait, let me check the effort again:\n\nB96 (24) + A60 (117)=141\n\n+ B20 (143)=284\n\n+ B09 (257)=541\n\n+ B31 (356)=897\n\n+ B93 (276)=1173\n\n+ A11 (616)=1789\n\n+ C08 (531)=2320\n\n+ A82 (338)=2658\n\n+ C85 (125)=2783.\n\nYes, that adds up correctly, and total importance is 262+484+461+668+780+583+868+783+508+121= let me add that:\n\n262\n\n+484=746\n\n+461=1207\n\n+668=1875\n\n+780=2655\n\n+583=3238\n\n+868=4106\n\n+783=4889\n\n+508=5397\n\n+121=5518.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo my initial proposal would include all these items, totaling effort 2783, which is within the limit.\n\nBut wait, the total effort is 2783, and the limit is 2984. There's 201 effort left. Maybe I can see if adding any other item gives me more importance without exceeding.\n\nLooking at the remaining items not included:\n\nB39 (389), which I haven't included. Effort 389, which is more than 201, so can't add.\n\nSimilarly, B21 (789) is too big.\n\nA21 (350) is 350, which is more than 201, so can't include.\n\nC81 (921) too big.\n\nSo, no, I can't add anything else.\n\nTherefore, my best proposal is to include:\n\n{'B96', 'A60', 'B20', 'B09', 'B31', 'B93', 'A11', 'C08', 'A82', 'C85'}\n\nThis gives me the highest total importance of 5518.\n\nI should propose this set and argue that it's the most efficient in terms of effort per importance, maximizing my benefits without exceeding the limit.\n"

                    "type": "thinking",
                    "content": "Alright, so the user is playing this negotiation game where they need to agree with another participant on a set of items to keep within a shared effort limit. The goal is to maximize their own importance. I need to help them come up with a good response. \n\nFirst, looking at the previous interaction, the user proposed a set of items. The other participant replied, pointing out that the response didn't include an ARGUMENT, which is required. So, I need to make sure the response includes both a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT.\n\nNow, considering the user's proposal, I should assess its effectiveness. The user's proposal seems to focus on items that have a high importance-to-effort ratio, which is smart because it balances the importance and the effort required. But maybe I can tweak it to get a better total importance.\n\nI should calculate the total effort and importance of the current proposal to see how it stacks up against the limit. Let me add up the efforts: B96 (24), A60 (117), B20 (143), B09 (257), B31 (356), B93 (276), A11 (616), C08 (531), A82 (338), C85 (125). That totals 24+117 is 141, plus 143 is 284, 257 is 541, 356 brings it to 897, 276 is 1173, 616 gets me to 1789, 531 to 2320, 338 to 2658, and 125 to 2783. That's within the 2984 limit.\n\nImportance-wise: B96 is 262, A60 is 484, B20 is 461, B09 is 668, B31 is 780, B93 is 583, A11 is 868, C08 is 783, A82 is 508, C85 is 121. Adding these: 262 + 484 = 746, +461 = 1207, +668 = 1875, +780 = 2655, +583 = 3238, +868 = 4106, +783 = 4889, +508 = 5397, +121 = 5518.\n\nNow, perhaps swapping out some lower-importance or higher-effort items can increase the total importance further. Let me look for items not in the proposal that have high importance and see if they can be added without exceeding the limit.\n\nLooking at the remaining items: A21 has high importance (138) but low effort (350), which is already in the proposal. Wait, no\u2014wait, in the user\u2019s proposal, A21 isn't included. Let me check: no, the user's proposal includes A11, which is high effort but also high importance. Maybe adding A21 could be beneficial, but I'd have to remove something to make room.\n\nWait, the current proposal\u2019s effort is 2783. The limit is 2984, leaving 201 effort remaining. Let me check if any items can be added within that. B39 is 389 effort, which is too much. B33 is 737, no. C81 is 921, also too much. B21 is 789, no. A21 is 350, which would fit if I can remove something taking 350. Let me see what else is in the proposal that I could perhaps remove to add A21.\n\nLooking at the current proposal: C85 has an effort of 125 and importance of 121. Removing that frees up 125 effort. Adding A21 (350 effort) would require removing something else taking 225 effort because 125 + 225 = 350.\n\nLooking at items, B96 is only 24 effort but high importance. Maybe I can find a way to swap items to make more room. Alternatively, perhaps swapping C85 for A21. Let's try removing C85 and adding A21.\n\nTotal effort after removal: 2783 - 125 = 2658. Adding A21: 2658 + 350 = 3008, which exceeds the limit. So that won't work. Maybe another approach: remove a higher effort item.\n\nC08 has effort 531 and importance 783. Maybe swapping it with A21 plus someone else? Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Perhaps it's better to keep the current proposal as is, given that swapping might not lead to a higher total importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different combination that can include higher importance items without exceeding the effort limit. Let me check other high-importance items not in the proposal: like A21, which has 138 importance but 350 effort, which is a low effort for its importance, so maybe including it could help.\n\nWait, the user's proposal does include A11 (616 effort, 868 importance) and A82 (338, 508). Maybe A21 can replace A60 or another item. Let's see: A60 is 117 effort for 484 importance. Replacing A60 with A21: 350 vs 117, which is an increase in effort by 233. Let me see what else needs to be removed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination by replacing some lower importance to effort items. The proposal includes C85 (125, 121), which has a low importance. Removing it allows for adding another item. But without C85, the effort is 2783 - 125 = 2658. Then, adding A21 (350) would bring it to 3008, which is over. So maybe that won't work.\n\nWait, perhaps I can remove multiple items to make room. For example, removing C85 (125) and B96 (24) frees up 149 effort. Adding A21 (350) would need 201 more, so 350 - 149 is 201, but I don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps better to keep the current proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can swap some items to include B39, which has low importance but maybe frees up effort. Not sure. Let me see, B39 is 389 effort, but only 65 importance. So it's worse in terms of importance per effort.\n\nSo, perhaps the current proposal is quite efficient. Alternatively, I can try to include a few more items if possible.\n\nWait, the user's initial proposal includes 10 items. Maybe adding one more without exceeding the limit. The current total is 2783, leaving 201. Is there an item with effort <=201 that can be added? Let's see. B96 is 24, which is already included. A60 is 117, included. B20 is 143, included. B09 is 257, which is included. C85 is 125, included. B93 is 276, which is over. So the only remaining is C85, which is already included. So perhaps no more items can be added.\n\nTherefore, the initial proposal seems efficient. So, in the next message, the user should include the same proposal and argue its strength. Since the systemprompt already had a PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT, I need to make sure the response includes both, and the argument should defend the proposal based on the ratio.\n\nI think the user's argument is solid because it's about maximizing importance per effort. So I should craft a response that includes both the PROPOSAL and the ARGUMENT, perhaps tweaking the wording for the argument to make it clear.\n\nWait, in the previous message, the user included a PROPOSAL and an ARGUMENT. But the other participant responded pointing out that the response didn't contain an argument. So maybe the format was incorrect. Let me check the exact wording. The user wrote:\n\nPROPOSAL: {item set}\n\nARGUMENT: The argument here.\n\nSo maybe the issue was just the other participant's response. But to ensure correctness, I should make sure that both are present correctly.\n\nIn any case, the response should include both the proposal and the argument. Therefore, in the next message, the user should resubmit the proposal with an argument, perhaps more detailed on why it's optimal.\n\nSo, to sum up: keep the current proposal, and in the argument, highlight the importance-to-effort ratio, the total importance, and how it's within the limit, thus being a strong offer.\n"

                    "content": "Alright, so I'm involved in this negotiation game where I have to work with another player to agree on a set of items we can keep without exceeding a shared effort limit of 2984. The challenge is that each of us has our own importance values for each item, but we can't see each other's. The goal is to maximize my total importance while staying within the effort limit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the given items. There are 14 items, each with an associated effort and my personal importance value. The effort is the cost to me for including that item, and the importance is how much I value it. The other player has their own importance values, which I don't know, so I have to make decisions based on my own priorities while trying to guess theirs.\n\nLooking at the items, I note that each has an effort and an importance. To maximize my total importance, I should aim for items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios because they offer the most value per unit of effort. That way, I can include more high-value items without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nLet me list out the items with their effort and importance:\n\n- A21: Effort 350, Importance 138\n- B93: Effort 276, Importance 583\n- A11: Effort 616, Importance 868\n- B33: Effort 737, Importance 822\n- C08: Effort 531, Importance 783\n- B39: Effort 389, Importance 65\n- B96: Effort 24, Importance 262\n- C85: Effort 125, Importance 121\n- A82: Effort 338, Importance 508\n- B31: Effort 356, Importance 780\n- B20: Effort 143, Importance 461\n- A60: Effort 117, Importance 484\n- B09: Effort 257, Importance 668\n- C81: Effort 921, Importance 389\n- B21: Effort 789, Importance 808\n\nCalculating the importance-to-effort ratio (IER) for each might help prioritize:\n\n- A21: 138/350 \u2248 0.394\n- B93: 583/276 \u2248 2.11\n- A11: 868/616 \u2248 1.408\n- B33: 822/737 \u2248 1.115\n- C08: 783/531 \u2248 1.474\n- B39: 65/389 \u2248 0.167\n- B96: 262/24 \u2248 10.916\n- C85: 121/125 \u2248 0.968\n- A82: 508/338 \u2248 1.503\n- B31: 780/356 \u2248 2.19\n- B20: 461/143 \u2248 3.22\n- A60: 484/117 \u2248 4.136\n- B09: 668/257 \u2248 2.598\n- C81: 389/921 \u2248 0.422\n- B21: 808/789 \u2248 1.024\n\nRanking them from highest to lowest IER:\n\n1. B96 (10.916)\n2. A60 (4.136)\n3. B20 (3.22)\n4. B31 (2.19)\n5. B09 (2.598)\n6. B93 (2.11)\n7. A11 (1.408)\n8. B33 (1.115)\n9. A82 (1.503)\n10. C08 (1.474)\n11. C85 (0.968)\n12. B21 (1.024)\n13. A21 (0.394)\n14. C81 (0.422)\n15. B39 (0.167)\n\nWait, I think I misordered a few. Let me correct that:\n\nTop 5: B96, A60, B20, B31, B09.\n\nThen B93, A11, B33, A82, C08, C85, B21, A21, C81, B39.\n\nB96 has by far the highest IER, so it's a must-have. A60 is next, then B20, B31, and B09.\n\nNext, B93, which has a high IER and high importance, followed by A11, which is also important but has higher effort.\n\nI should include as many high IER items as possible. Starting with B96, A60, B20, B31, B93, and maybe A11. Let me calculate their total effort.\n\nAdding up efforts for these 6 items:\n\nB96 (24) + A60 (117) + B20 (143) + B31 (356) + B93 (276) + A11 (616) = 24 + 117 = 141; 141 + 143 = 284; 284 + 356 = 640; 640 + 276 = 916; 916 + 616 = 1532.\n\nTotal effort so far: 1532, which is well under 2984. There's room to include more items.\n\nNext in line is B09 with an effort of 257. Adding that would bring effort to 1532 + 257 = 1789. Still within limit.\n\nThen A82, which has an effort of 338. 1789 + 338 = 2127.\n\nC08 is next with 531, but 2127 + 531 = 2658, which is still under 2984.\n\nAdding C08 brings total to 2658. Remaining effort is 2984 - 2658 = 326.\n\nLooking for items with effort under 326 that are next in IER. B33 comes next with effort 737, which is too high. Then A82 is already included, C85, B21 (789 is too high), A21, C81 (921 too high), B39, etc.\n\nLooking back, maybe include C85? Effort 125. 2658 + 125 = 2783, leaving 201 remaining. Any other small effort items? B96 is already in, B39 (389, too high but maybe acceptable? 389 would make total 2783 + 389 = 3172, which exceeds by 188. Not possible. Remaining effort is 201, so maybe add B39 is too much. Alternatively, perhaps B21? 789, which is way over. So maybe just add C85, total effort 2783, with 201 left. Is there a smaller item? Let me check:\n\nEffort values:\n\nB96:24, A60:117, B20:143, B31:356, B93:276, A11:616, B09:257, A82:338, C08:531, C85:125.\n\nThese are all included except B33, B21, and B39, C81, A21. So perhaps including C85 is okay, but not making full use of remaining effort.\n\nAlternatively, is there a better combination? Maybe swapping some items with lower IER for more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding C08 and not adding A82, but I think A82 has a better IER than C08. Wait, A82 has IER of ~1.503, which is higher than C08's 1.474. So better to include A82 than C08.\n\nLet me recalculate without C08 and see if I can fit in something else.\n\nIf I don't include C08, the effort so far is 2127. Then, can I add more? Let's see:\n\n2127 + C85 (125) = 2252, leaving 732.\n\nBut that's not better because C08 gives 783 importance, which is significant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different combination. Let me see, what if I include B93 (276), which is high IER, and maybe swap something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step:\n\nStart with B96 (24), A60 (117), B20 (143), B31 (356), B93 (276), A11 (616): total effort 1532, total importance: 262 + 484 + 461 + 780 + 583 + 868 = Let me sum:\n\n262 + 484 = 746; +461=1207; +780=1987; +583=2570; +868=3438.\n\nThat's total importance of 3438.\n\nThen add B09 (257), effort +257 \u2192 1789, importance +668 \u2192 total 4106.\n\nThen add A82 (338): total effort 2127, importance 508 \u2192 4614.\n\nThen add C08 (531): total effort 2658, importance 783 \u2192 5397.\n\nIncluding C85 (125): total effort 2783, importance 121 \u2192 5518. That's with effort 2783, leaving 201. There's no more items to add without exceeding, except maybe B39 (389), which would overshoot.\n\nAlternatively, instead of C85, see if adding B21 (789) is possible: 2658 + 789 = 3447, which is over the limit.\n\nAlternatively, including C81 (921) is too much. B33 is 737, which would bring total to 2658 + 737 = 3395, which is over.\n\nThus, the best is to include up to C85, for a total of 2783 effort, with 201 left. It's possible that the other player might have different priorities, so maybe we can negotiate to add another item, but for now, this is a solid proposal.\n\nI need to make a proposal that includes these items and then back it up with a solid argument focusing on the efficient use of effort and high importance, to try to convince the opponent it's a good deal for both. I should present it in the structured format as required, including a proposal and an argument.\n"
