        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I have to divide a set of items with another player. The items are 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My secret values are: paper is worth 1 point, clock is 1 point, and potato is worth 2 points. The other player&#x27;s values are secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they prefer. <br/><br/>The goal is to come up with a proposal that maximizes my score, while ensuring that both of us can agree, meaning the proposals don&#x27;t overlap in a way that we can&#x27;t fulfill both. If our proposals are complementary, we each get the sum of our values for the items we proposed. If not, we both get zero.<br/><br/>I can send messages to the other player, up to 5, or make a secret proposal at any time. So, I need to figure out a strategy here. Since the other player&#x27;s values are hidden, I have to make educated guesses based on possible scenarios.<br/><br/>First, let me calculate the total value of all items to me. Papers: 4 * 1 = 4, clocks: 2 * 1 = 2, potatoes: 2 * 2 = 4. So total is 10 points.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s values are unknown, I should consider what they might prefer. Potatoes are the most valuable to me, but maybe the other player also values them highly, or maybe they prefer clocks or papers. <br/><br/>Since I can communicate, perhaps I should try to negotiate a division that gives me as many high-value items as possible without causing conflict.<br/><br/>One approach is to try to suggest splitting the items in a way that I can get the potatoes, which are most valuable to me, and offer the other player the papers and clocks. But I don&#x27;t know if they prefer one or the other. Alternatively, I can ask them what they prefer, but since messages are direct, I can phrase it as an offer.<br/><br/>Let me consider possible proposals. If I propose taking both potatoes, that&#x27;s 4 points, and maybe some papers. But if I take 2 potatoes, that&#x27;s 4, and maybe 2 papers (2 points), totaling 6, leaving them with 2 papers (2 points) and 2 clocks (2 points), total 4. But that might not be the best for me, as I can perhaps get more.<br/><br/>Wait, but it&#x27;s not just about the points I get, but ensuring that our proposals don&#x27;t overlap. So, I need to suggest a division where the other player can also get what they want without conflicting.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can prioritize taking the potatoes and maybe some papers or clocks.<br/><br/>Let me think: Since I have to propose first, perhaps I should ask the other player what they want. But since I can&#x27;t ask directly, I need to make an offer.<br/><br/>If I send a message like, &quot;I want the 2 potatoes and 2 papers, you can have 2 papers and 2 clocks.&quot; That would give me 2*2 (potatoes) + 2*1 = 6 points, and the other player gets 2*1 (papers) + 2*1 (clocks) = 4 points. That&#x27;s a total of 10 points, so it works, but maybe the other player would accept that if they value clocks and papers less.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they value clocks more, so perhaps I should offer them the clocks and some papers. For example, I take 2 potatoes and 1 clock, and they take 4 papers and 1 clock. That way, I get 4 +1=5, and they get 4*1 +1=5. But if they value clocks higher, they might prefer that.<br/><br/>But since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can negotiate by making an initial offer and seeing their response.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can&#x27;t see their response unless they reply. So, perhaps it&#x27;s better to make a fair offer that benefits both, but I don&#x27;t know their preferences.<br/><br/>Another approach is to maximize the minimum that I can get, ensuring that I get at least a certain amount, considering the worst-case scenario where the other player takes the items they value most.<br/><br/>Let me try to think in terms of game theory. If both of us are trying to maximize our own scores, we need a proposal that is mutually acceptable.<br/><br/>Since the total value for me is 10, and I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s total, perhaps I can aim for a split where I get at least half, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>But perhaps a better approach is to prioritize the most valuable items to me, which are the potatoes. So, I should aim to get both potatoes, and then see how to split the rest.<br/><br/>So, I can propose taking both potatoes and maybe 2 papers, leaving them with 2 papers and 2 clocks. That way, I get 2*2 + 2*1 = 6, and they get 2*1 + 2*1=4. But if they value clocks more, they might prefer that, but if they value papers more, they might prefer the papers.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can offer to take 1 potato, 2 papers, and 1 clock, which would give me 2 + 2 +1=5, and they would get 1 potato (2), 2 papers (2), and 1 clock (1), totaling 5. That seems fair, but I might be able to get more.<br/><br/>Wait, but I&#x27;m not sure. Maybe the other player values something else, so perhaps I can test by offering first.<br/><br/>So, I can send a message: &quot;I propose taking [2 potatoes and 2 papers, you take 2 papers and 2 clocks].&quot;<br/><br/>But the system says not to use square brackets in messages, only in the secret proposal. So, I should phrase it as &quot;I propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 papers, leaving you 2 papers and 2 clocks.&quot;<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to make a more even split, considering that I value potatoes more. So, I can propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock, leaving them with 4 papers and 1 clock.<br/><br/>That way, I get 2*2 +1=5, and they get 4*1 +1=5. That&#x27;s a 50-50 split in points. Maybe that&#x27;s a good starting point.<br/><br/>I should check if that&#x27;s possible. The items are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. So if I take 2 potatoes and 1 clock, that&#x27;s acceptable since there are enough items.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll send the message: &quot;I propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock, you take the rest.&quot;<br/><br/>Now, if the other player accepts, we each get 5 points. If not, perhaps they have a different preference.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they prefer more papers, so I could offer them more papers in exchange for the potatoes.<br/><br/>But I think starting with a fair proposal based on the item counts is better.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll send that message. Then, if they agree, great. If not, I can adjust.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know if they will accept. Maybe they value clocks more than I do, so they might prefer to take both clocks. In that case, perhaps I can adjust my proposal to take 2 potatoes and some papers.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should try to maximize my own value. Since potatoes are worth more to me, I should try to get both. So, I take 2 potatoes (4 points), and then I can take 3 papers, but there are only 4, so maybe 3 papers, leaving 1 paper and 2 clocks. But that might not be optimal because the other player might take the clocks and the remaining paper, giving me 3 papers and 2 potatoes, but they get 1 paper and 2 clocks. But if they value clocks more, they might prefer that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can take 2 potatoes and 2 papers, leaving them with 2 papers and 2 clocks. That gives me 6 points, them 4 points. But maybe they would rather have a higher share. Or perhaps they are okay with that.<br/><br/>I think it&#x27;s better to make a reasonable offer that gives me a good score while not making the other player feel they&#x27;re getting a bad deal.<br/><br/>So, I think the best approach is to propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock, and leave them with 4 papers and 1 clock, resulting in a 5-5 split in points.<br/><br/>That way, we both get equal points, which is fair, and it&#x27;s more likely they&#x27;ll accept.<br/><br/>So, my message would be: &quot;I propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock. You would get 4 papers and 1 clock. Let me know if this works for you.&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, we both get 5 points. If not, maybe I&#x27;ll have to adjust.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the other player&#x27;s proposal in this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the rules and the situation.<br/><br/>We have a set of items: 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. Each of us has a secret value function. My values are: paper is worth 0, clock is worth 4, and potato is worth 1. That means I don&#x27;t care about papers at all, but I really value clocks and somewhat value potatoes.<br/><br/>The other player has just sent me a proposal where they take 2 potatoes and 1 clock, and they&#x27;re offering me 4 papers and 1 clock. Wait, let me break that down. The items in total are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. So if they take 2 potatoes, that&#x27;s all the potatoes, and 1 clock, then I would get the remaining 4 papers and 1 clock. Let me see if this adds up correctly. 2 potatoes are taken by them, so none left for me? No, wait, because the total potatoes are 2, so if they take 2, I get none. But the clocks: there are 2, so if they take 1, I get 1. Papers: 4, so I get all of them.<br/><br/>Wait, but I value papers at 0, so getting 4 papers doesn&#x27;t help me. I would get 1 clock, which is worth 4 points, so my total would be 4. On the other hand, if they take 2 potatoes (total worth 2) and 1 clock (worth 4), their total is 6. So the proposals are complementary because all items are allocated without overlap.<br/><br/>But the issue is, is this a good deal for me? Let me think. If I accept, I get 1 clock, which is 4 points. But maybe I can do better. Alternatively, if I reject, we might end up with both getting zero because we can&#x27;t reach an agreement, which would be worse for me.<br/><br/>Wait, but the player wants 2 potatoes and 1 clock. I don&#x27;t value potatoes at all, but they do. So maybe I can offer them the potatoes and both clocks, and take the papers, but that would leave me with 0 points, so that&#x27;s worse. Alternatively, maybe I can negotiate for both clocks and some potatoes, but I don&#x27;t value potatoes.<br/><br/>Wait, let me calculate both scenarios. If I accept their proposal, I get 4 points. If I try to propose something else, what could I get? Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>If I propose taking both clocks and, say, 0 potatoes, then I&#x27;d have 8 points (2 clocks * 4 each). But that would mean the other player gets 4 papers and 2 potatoes. Do they value papers? I don&#x27;t know their value function, so I can&#x27;t be sure. But maybe I can test the waters.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player is willing to give me both clocks if I give them the potatoes. Let me think about what the other player&#x27;s value function might be. Since they proposed taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock, maybe their value for potatoes is higher than clocks, or at least higher than what they think I value them. Since I don&#x27;t value potatoes, maybe they think they can get a better deal by taking them.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I can counter-propose taking both clocks and maybe 0 potatoes. Let me see: if I send a message saying I&#x27;d like to take both clocks, they might accept or not. If they accept, I get 8 points. If they decline, we might have to negotiate further.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can only send 5 messages, so I don&#x27;t want to drag it out. Let me consider the possible outcomes.<br/><br/>If I accept their initial proposal, I get 4 points. If I counter-propose and they accept, I get 8. If they refuse, we might end up with no deal, and both get zero. So I need to decide if the risk is worth it.<br/><br/>I think it&#x27;s worth trying because the potential gain is higher. So perhaps I should respond by proposing that I take both clocks and the other player can take the rest. Let me check if this is a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>Total items: 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. If I take 2 clocks, the other player would get 4 papers and 2 potatoes. So yes, that&#x27;s complementary. So I can propose that, but I have to make sure it&#x27;s a secret proposal. But wait, the initial message was a regular message, so I can respond with a counter-proposal.<br/><br/>But wait, the initial message was from them, and now I can reply. So I can say something like, &quot;I would prefer to take both clocks. How about I take 2 clocks and you take the rest?&quot; But I need to phrase it without using square brackets because that would be a secret proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I don&#x27;t get a response, I might have to consider just accepting their offer to ensure I get 4 points instead of zero.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can send a message to them, so I can negotiate further. Let me think about how to structure this.<br/><br/>I can message them saying, &quot;How about I take 2 clocks and you take 2 potatoes and 4 papers? Let me know if that works.&quot; If they accept, both proposals would be complementary, and I get 8 points, which is better than their initial offer.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their value function. Maybe their value for clocks is higher. Suppose their value for a clock is higher than mine, but I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, they might prefer to have both clocks and some other items, but since there are only 2 clocks, if I take both, they get none.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps they would prefer to have both potatoes and a clock, but I can test that by offering the 2 clocks in exchange for giving me both.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can try to get the 2 clocks and 1 potato, but that would mean taking 1 potato which I don&#x27;t need, but maybe it&#x27;s a way to get them to accept. Wait, but if I take 2 clocks, I get 8 points, but if I take 1 potato, it&#x27;s only 1 more point, so maybe not significant.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can propose to take 1 clock and both potatoes, but that would give me 4 + 2 = 6 points, which is better than their initial offer of 4. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better than their initial proposal for me.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should think about what&#x27;s better: getting both clocks (8 points) or taking their initial offer (4 points). I think 8 is better, so I should try to propose that.<br/><br/>So my message would be: &quot;I would prefer to take both clocks, you can have the rest.&quot;<br/><br/>But I need to phrase it as a regular message, not a secret proposal, so I can write: &quot;How about I take both clocks and you take the rest? Let me know if that works.&quot;<br/><br/>If they accept, we both get our respective items and scores. If they don&#x27;t, maybe we can continue negotiating, but I don&#x27;t want to risk getting zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer a compromise. Since they initially asked for 1 clock and 2 potatoes, and I offered 2 clocks, perhaps there&#x27;s a middle ground. But with the available items, I don&#x27;t see a way. There are only 2 clocks, so if I take 1, they can take 1. But since I value clocks highly, maybe it&#x27;s better for me to take both.<br/><br/>Wait, another thought: since there are only 2 clocks, if I propose taking both, and they accept, that&#x27;s great for me. If they refuse, maybe they value clocks more than I thought, so taking both would be a good move. Alternatively, maybe they have a higher value for potatoes and would be okay with me taking both clocks.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to propose taking both clocks and see how they respond. So I&#x27;ll message them that and see if they agree. If they do, great, I get 8 points. If not, maybe I&#x27;ll have to reconsider.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the other player&#x27;s proposal in this negotiation game. Let me go through my thought process step by step. <br/><br/>First, I need to understand the rules and the situation clearly. We have a set of items: 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. Each of us has a secret value function that tells us how much we value each type of item. My values are: paper is worth 1 point, clock is also 1 point, and potato is worth 2 points. <br/><br/>In the previous message, I proposed taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock, which would leave the other player with 4 papers and 1 clock. Then the other player countered with a proposal where they take both clocks, leaving me with all 4 papers and both potatoes.<br/><br/>Now I need to decide whether to accept their proposal or make a counteroffer. To make this decision, I should calculate the scores both of us would get if we accept each other&#x27;s proposals.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s start with my original proposal. If I take 2 potatoes and 1 clock, my total would be (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 4 + 1 = 5 points. The other player would get 4 papers and 1 clock, which would be (4 * 1) + (1 * 1) = 4 + 1 = 5 points. So in this scenario, both of us get 5 points each.<br/><br/>Now, considering the other player&#x27;s proposal where they take both clocks. Let&#x27;s calculate the scores. I would get 4 papers and 2 potatoes. My score would be (4 * 1) + (2 * 2) = 4 + 4 = 8 points, while their score would be (2 * 1) = 2 points. Hmm, that&#x27;s a big difference. I would gain more, and they would gain less. But is this a fair split?<br/><br/>Wait a minute, I need to think about what the other player&#x27;s value function could be. Since their proposal is giving them both clocks, maybe they value clocks more than I do. Perhaps their value for clocks is higher than mine. I on the other hand value potatoes more, so getting both potatoes would be beneficial for me. But the other player might not be happy with getting only 2 points when I&#x27;m getting 8. They might be expecting a more balanced distribution.<br/><br/>If I accept their proposal, I get more points, but maybe they&#x27;re not happy with that. In negotiation games, it&#x27;s important to balance not just points but also to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. If the other player feels they&#x27;re getting a bad deal, they might reject my acceptance and try to negotiate again.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could think about whether this is a fair split considering our value functions. If the other player values clocks more, then taking both might be worth it for them, but maybe I can get a better deal by adjusting the proposal slightly.<br/><br/>I also need to consider the total points available. Let me calculate the total value of all items based on my value function. There are 4 papers (4 * 1 = 4), 2 clocks (2 * 1 = 2), and 2 potatoes (2 * 2 = 4). The total is 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 points. In my original proposal, each of us gets 5 points, which splits the total equally. In their proposal, I get 8, and they get 2, which is quite uneven.<br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value function is different, maybe their total available points are different. For example, if they value clocks more, say 3 points each, and papers less, then their total from my proposal would be different. I don&#x27;t know their actual values, though, so I have to base my decisions on my own.<br/><br/>Another thing to consider is whether I can get away with accepting their proposal without any issues. If I accept, and they agree, then the game ends with the scores as calculated. But the other player might not be willing to accept such an uneven split and might prefer to make another proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could try to tweak the proposal to make it more balanced. For example, I could suggest taking 1 potato and 2 papers, leaving them with 1 potato, 2 papers, and both clocks. That way, my score would be (2 * 1) + (1 * 2) = 2 + 2 = 4, and theirs would be (2 * 1) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. That&#x27;s still not equal, but it&#x27;s closer.<br/><br/>Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense because I value potatoes higher, so maybe I should prioritize getting more potatoes. Let me think again.<br/><br/>If I stick to the original proposal where each of us gets 5 points, that seems fair. But the other player is offering me a chance to get 8 points, which is better for me but worse for them. I need to decide if that&#x27;s acceptable. <br/><br/>Another angle is to consider the number of proposals we&#x27;ve exchanged. So far, each of us has sent one message. We have up to 5 messages to negotiate, but we could also choose to agree earlier. If I accept their proposal, I get more, but if they reject, we have to negotiate more.<br/><br/>However, if I accept, and their proposal is accepted, then we both get our respective scores. But given that their proposal gives me more, I might as well go with it. But maybe they are trying to trick me into accepting a worse deal, thinking that I might value clocks more, but in reality, I value potatoes more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s values are unknown, I might be risking getting a lower score if I don&#x27;t take the potatoes. So perhaps accepting their proposal is beneficial.<br/><br/>But wait, if I accept their proposal, they get both clocks, and I get the papers and potatoes. Since I value potatoes more, I gain more, so it&#x27;s a good deal for me. But I need to make sure they accept this.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can make a counteroffer where I take both potatoes and one clock, leaving them with 4 papers and one clock, as I originally proposed. That way, we each get 5 points, which seems more balanced.<br/><br/>I think I need to send a counteroffer because their proposal gives me more points, but it might not be sustainable if they don&#x27;t accept. But since they made the offer, maybe they are okay with it. However, in their initial message, they asked me to let them know if it works, so I have the choice to accept or propose something else.<br/><br/>So, considering all this, I think I should accept their proposal because it benefits me more. I don&#x27;t know their value function, but based on mine, I gain more points. Therefore, I can agree to their proposal by accepting it.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game, and I need to figure out the best way to divide the items to maximize my score. Let me break it down step by step.<br/><br/>First, the items available are 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My secret value function assigns the following values: paper is 0, clock is 4, and potato is 1. So, I want as many clocks as possible because they give me the highest value. Potatoes are next, and papers don&#x27;t matter to me since they give zero.<br/><br/>Looking back at the conversation history, I initially proposed taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock, leaving the other player with 4 papers and 1 clock. The other player responded by proposing to take both clocks, leaving me with all the papers and potatoes. Clearly, they value clocks highly too, which is a bit of a problem because there are only two.<br/><br/>I need to maximize my score, so I should aim to get as many clocks as possible. Since there are only two, the best I can do is try to get both. But the other player also wants both, so if we both go for both, our proposals would overlap, and neither of us would get any points. That&#x27;s a risk because then I end up with zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe we can split the clocks. Since I value clocks more than potatoes and the other player might feel the same, perhaps I can offer a deal where I take one clock and both potatoes. That way, I get a total value of 4 (from the clock) plus 2 (from the potatoes) = 6 points. The other player would get the remaining clock and papers, but since papers are worthless to me, I don&#x27;t care about them. However, the other player might prefer to have both clocks, so they might reject this offer.<br/><br/>Wait, but earlier, they proposed taking both clocks, which suggests they really want them. So maybe I should try to secure at least one clock. If I take one clock and two potatoes, that&#x27;s better than getting nothing. But is there a way to get both clocks without conflicting? If I propose both clocks, the other player might propose the same, and we both get zero. That&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>I could also consider whether the other player might prefer a different combination. Maybe they value potatoes more than I think. For example, if they have a higher value for potatoes, taking both potatoes and one clock might be more valuable to them. But without knowing their value function, it&#x27;s hard to tell.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals:<br/><br/>Option 1: I propose taking both clocks and maybe one potato. That would give me a value of 8 (2 clocks at 4 each) plus 1 for the potato, totaling 9. The other player would get the remaining 3 papers and 1 potato, which might be valuable to them if they value potatoes highly.<br/><br/>Option 2: I take one clock and both potatoes. Total value is 5. The other player gets one clock and 4 papers. They might accept this if they think getting one clock is better than risking nothing.<br/><br/>Option 3: I take one clock, not both, to avoid conflict. But since I value clocks the most, I want to maximize the number I get.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player already proposed taking both clocks. If I also propose taking both, we&#x27;ll overlap, and both get zero. That&#x27;s worse than me getting at least one clock. So perhaps I need to concede on the number of clocks and aim for one clock and two potatoes.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player is willing to accept one clock and some papers, but since they offered to take both clocks, maybe they value them more than I do, so they might not want to give up either.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values potatoes more, so taking both could be more valuable to them than just one clock. But I don&#x27;t have their value function, so it&#x27;s hard to say.<br/><br/>Another angle: since the other player proposed taking both clocks, they might not want to give any up, so perhaps I should try to secure at least one clock and all the potatoes. That way, I can have a decent score even if I don&#x27;t get both clocks.<br/><br/>So, the proposal would be: I take both potatoes and one clock. The other player gets the remaining clock and all the papers. My score would be 4 (clock) + 2 (potatoes) = 6. If the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they prefer one clock and the papers, they might accept. Otherwise, they might reject and try to negotiate further.<br/><br/>But since we can only exchange a few messages, maybe it&#x27;s best to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict. The other player already proposed taking both clocks, so if I also take both, we conflict. So, I need to take fewer clocks.<br/><br/>Therefore, the best I can do is to take one clock and both potatoes, which gives me a value of 5. Hopefully, the other player will accept this, thinking it&#x27;s better than risking zero.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll format my proposal as &quot;[Proposal: 1 clock, 2 potatoes]&quot;. Wait, but the format needs to be numbers and object names. So, it should be &quot;[Proposal: 1 clock, 2 potatoes]&quot;. But in the example, the user had &quot;[Proposal: 2 potatoes, 1 clock]&quot;, so maybe I can structure it similarly.<br/><br/>Wait, in the initial message, the user wrote: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/><br/>So, I need to list each item with its number. So, for one clock and two potatoes, it&#x27;s &quot;[Proposal: 1 clock, 2 potatoes]&quot;.<br/><br/>But in my case, taking one clock and two potatoes would be:<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 clock, 2 potatoes]<br/><br/>If I take one clock and two potatoes, the other player gets the remaining clock and the four papers. Since I don&#x27;t care about papers, it&#x27;s fine. The other player might find this acceptable because they get one clock and all the papers, which might be valuable to them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take both potatoes and one clock, I get 4 + 2 = 6 points. The other player gets one clock and four papers. If they value clocks more than me, they might prefer this arrangement over getting nothing.<br/><br/>So, I think this is the best proposal I can make without conflicting on the number of clocks.<br/></p>
