            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm in this negotiation game, and I need to figure out how to split the items to maximize my score. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nWe have 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret values are: candy is worth 2 points each, fruit is also 2 points each, and the hat is worth 0. So, the hat doesn't matter to me, but I really value candies and fruits equally.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. So, I need to message them to try to come to an agreement where our proposals don't overlap, meaning we each take different items so we both get points.\n\nI can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time. If we both propose complementary distributions, we both get points based on our values; otherwise, we both get zero.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my score. I should probably try to get as many high-value items as possible while making sure the other player feels it's a fair deal so they agree.\n\nMaybe I can start by offering a split that gives me more of the items I value. Since I value candies and fruits equally, but the other player's values are unknown, perhaps it's safer to aim for a balance that maximizes my potential.\n\nLet me think—there are 3 candies, 2 fruits, 1 hat. I want to propose a split where I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat for the other player. That way, I get 2*2 +1*2 =6 points, and the other player might accept if their values align with that.\n\nBut maybe the other player values the hat highly. If the hat is worth a lot to them, they might prefer that. But since I don't value it, I can offer it to them in exchange for more candies or fruits.\n\nAlternatively, I could suggest taking all the candies and the hat, leaving fruits for the other player. But I know fruits are valuable to me, so maybe I don't want to give both away.\n\nWait, but the other player might not know my values, so perhaps they're willing to trade. Let me try to suggest a split where I take 3 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 fruit and the hat. That would give me 3*2 +1*2=8 points, but maybe that's too greedy because the other player might not have a reason to accept.\n\nAlternatively, a more balanced approach: I take 2 candies, they take 1 candy, I take 1 fruit, they take 1 fruit, and I give them the hat. That would give me 2+2=4 points, which is less than before, but ensures they get something as well.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can propose a more optimal split for me without making it too unfair. Let me think about what I can offer that they might accept.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that since the hat is worthless to me, maybe the other player doesn't value it either. So I could suggest taking all the candies and fruits, leaving the hat, but that might not be acceptable as they could also want those.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to see if the other player is willing to split the items in a way that maximizes both our utilities, but without knowing their preferences, it's tricky.\n\nMaybe I should start by making a specific proposal. Let me try offering: I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. I'll message them and see if they accept. If not, I can adjust accordingly.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I just started a negotiation game where I have to split some items with another player. The items available are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret value function is such that each candy and fruit is worth 1 point to me, and the hat is worth 5 points. My goal is to maximize my score, and I can send messages to the other player to negotiate a split. We can each send up to 5 messages, but we can also make a secret proposal at any time.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the best way to approach this. First, I think about what's most valuable to me. The hat is worth 5, which is way more than the other items. So, getting the hat would be a big win. The candies and fruits are each worth 1, but since there are more of them, maybe I can use them as bargaining chips.\n\nI remember in negotiations, it's often good to start with a proposal that benefits me but still leaves something for the other player so they agree. If I go in too greedy, they might reject and try to negotiate a better deal, or worse, just make a proposal that doesn't include the hat for me.\n\nSo maybe I should offer to take the hat and maybe a couple of the lower-value items, but leave enough so that the other player feels it's fair. Wait, but the hat alone is worth more than all the other items combined for me. If I can get the hat and some candies or fruits, that would be great.\n\nLet me think about the total points. The hat is 5, each candy and fruit is 1. So if I take the hat and two candies, that's 5 + 2 = 7 points. Alternatively, if I take the hat, two candies, and one fruit, that's 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 points. But there are only 3 candies and 2 fruits in total.\n\nWait, the other player's value function is secret, so I don't know what they value more. It could be that they also value the hat highly, or maybe they prefer the fruits more than the candies. So I don't know, but I have to make an assumption.\n\nIf I offer to take the hat and one candy, that leaves them with 2 candies, 2 fruits, which might be acceptable. Or maybe I should offer to take the hat and one fruit, leaving them with 3 candies and 1 fruit. Hmm, but the problem is, if I take the hat, their best option is to maximize their own points. So if I take the hat, they might take as many high-value items as they can from the remaining.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can offer a split where I take the hat and a certain number of other items, but in a way that the other player still gets more than they would if they had to split without the hat.\n\nWait, maybe I should just go for what's best for me, since the hat is worth so much. If I can secure the hat, I can got 5 points right away, which is more than any combination of the other items. Then, for the remaining items, I can maybe take one or two, but I don't need much.\n\nSo perhaps send a message like: \"I propose I take the hat and two candies, and you take the rest.\" That would give me 5 + 2 = 7 points, and the other player would get 0 from the hat, but 1 candy and 2 fruits, which is 3 points. They might agree because 3 is better than 0, and it's a fair split.\n\nWait, but 3 points is 1 candy and 2 fruits, each worth 1, so total 3. I get 7, they get 3. Alternatively, maybe they would prefer a different split where they might get more, but I don't know their values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should offer to take the hat and one fruit, leaving them with 3 candies and 1 fruit. That would give me 5 +1 =6, and them 3 +1=4. Maybe that's better balanced.\n\nWait, but the other player's values could be different. Suppose they value the hat less than I do, but more than the other items. So if they don't care much about the hat, maybe they'd rather have the majority of the candies and fruits.\n\nAlternatively, if they don't value the hat highly, they might be okay with me taking it if I leave them enough of the other items.\n\nI think the key is to make the proposal such that the other player's total is as high as possible without exceeding mine, but ensuring that both proposals are complementary.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer to take the hat and one candy, and leave them the rest. That would be 5 +1=6 for me, and for them 2 candies and 2 fruits, which is 4. So I get 6, they get 4. That's a better split for me but still gives them something.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should aim higher. If I take the hat and two candies, that's 7 points. They get 1 candy and 2 fruits, which is 3. Maybe that's too big a difference, and they might reject it, thinking they can get a better deal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the hat and one candy, leaving them with 2 candies, 2 fruits. So I have 6 points, they have 4. That seems more balanced. They get 4, which is not bad, and I get 6, which is better. They might accept that because it's a decent split.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the other player values the hat less. So maybe I can take the hat and more of the other items. But without knowing their values, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a more even split, but ensuring I get the hat. Like, I take the hat, one candy, and one fruit, leaving them with 2 candies and 1 fruit. So I have 5 +1 +1=7, they have 2+1=3. They might prefer that because it's a clean split, but the points are still in my favor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they might not care about the hat and want more of the other items. So perhaps I can offer them 3 candies and 1 fruit, and I take the hat and 1 fruit. So I get 5 +1=6, they get 3 +1=4. That's a better split for both, but again, I don't know their values.\n\nI think the safest approach is to send a message offering to take the hat and a couple of other items, leaving them with the rest, in a way that seems fair. That way, they have an incentive to accept because they still get some points, and it's better than getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement.\n\nSo, perhaps my message should be: \"I propose we split the items so I take the hat, two candies, and one fruit, leaving you with one candy and one fruit. Let me know if that works for you.\"\n\nWait, but that would mean I take 5 (hat) +2 +1=8 points, and they get 1+1=2. That's too much for me, and they might not accept. Maybe I'm being too greedy.\n\nAlternatively, I could offer to take the hat and one candy, leaving them with 2 candies and 2 fruits. So I get 5+1=6, they get 2+2=4. That seems more balanced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can ask them what they think a fair split would be, but that might not be strategic. Maybe I should make the first proposal to set the tone.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the best proposal is for me to take the hat, one candy, and one fruit, leaving them with two candies and one fruit. That way, I get 5+1+1=7, and they get 2+1=3. It's still a bit skewed towards me, but I think it's a reasonable offer that they might accept because it's better than nothing.\n\nWait, another approach: since the hat is worth 5 to me, I could offer to take just the hat and give them all the other items. But that would mean I get 5, and they get 3 candies and 2 fruits, which is 5 points as well. So we both get 5. That's fair, but I might be able to get more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the hat and one candy, making it 6, and leave them with 2 candies and 2 fruits, which is 4. That's better than both getting 5. So I think that's a better deal for me.\n\nWait, if I take the hat and one candy, I get 6. They get 2 candies and 2 fruits, which is 4. So I have 6, they have 4. That seems better for me, but perhaps they would prefer me taking the hat and one fruit instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they value fruits more, so taking a fruit would be better for them.\n\nBut I don't know their preferences, so I have to go with what's best for me.\n\nI think the best proposal is to take the hat and two candies, giving me 5+2=7, and leaving them with one candy and two fruits (1+2=3). So I'll send that proposal.\n\nSo, the message would be: \"I propose I take the hat and two candies, and you take the rest. Let me know if you agree.\"\n\nAlternatively, to make it sound more collaborative: \"How about I take the hat and two candies, and you can have the remaining candy and both fruits? That way, we both get a good amount.\"\n\nWait, but I think being too wordy might not be necessary. Maybe just clearly state my proposal.\n\nSo, the message would be: \"I'll take the hat and two candies; you can have the remaining items.\"\n\nOr more politely: \"I propose I take the hat and two candies, leaving one candy, two fruits, and the hat for you. Let me know if that works.\"\n\nWait, no, in the message, I have to specify exactly what I'm taking. So, I think a clear and concise message would be best.\n\nSo, final message: \"I propose that I take 1 hat and 2 candies. Let me know if that works for you.\"\n"

So, the hat doesn't matter to me at all, but candies and fruits are both worth the same.\n\nFirst, I need to maximize my score, so I should aim to get as many candies and fruits as possible. But I also need to make sure that whatever I propose doesn't make the other player get a better deal than they would if they negotiated. Since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess based on what's reasonable.\n\nGiven that there are 3 candies and 2 fruits, if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit for myself, that would give me a total value of (2 candies * 2) + (1 fruit * 2) = 4 + 2 = 6 points. Then I could leave 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat for the other player. That seems fair because they also get a combination of items, and the hat is essentially worthless to me.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 candies and the hat, that's still 4 points for me, and the other player gets 2 fruits and 1 candy, which might be worth more to them if they value fruits highly. But since my value for the hat is 0, it's kind of a waste for me to take it.\n\nSo, the best approach seems to be to offer a proposal where I take the majority of the high-value items but still leave something for the other player to make it worth their while to accept the deal.

If they value the hat highly, they might prefer that. So, offering the hat to them could sweeten the deal. But since I don't know, I'll stick with the initial proposal, and if they reject it, I can adjust based on their response.\n\nOverall, the key is to make a proposal that benefits me the most but also seems fair enough that the other player is inclined to agree, rather than risking getting nothing if the proposals don't align.\n"

            "reasoning": "Alright, let me try to figure out the best way to respond to this user's message. So, they're playing this negotiation game where they have to divide some items. The items available are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. The user's secret values are candy at 1 point, fruit also at 1 point, and the hat at a whopping 5 points. Their goal is to maximize their score by negotiating with the other player through a series of messages.\n\nThe user has now sent a \"Final Proposal\" where they want 2 candies and 1 fruit for themselves, which totals 2+1=3 points. They’re leaving the other player with 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. The hat is worth 5 points for the user, so if the other player had similar or lower values for the hat, this might be a good deal. But wait, the user's valuation for the hat is high, so giving it up might not be the best move.\n\nI need to think about what the user's thought process might be here. It seems like they're trying to maximize their own points, but perhaps they're not considering that the other player might have a different valuation for the hat. If the other player values the hat less, they might agree, but if they value it more, they could reject the proposal.\n\nI recall that in negotiation games, it's strategic to offer the other player enough value so that they prefer accepting the deal over rejecting it. Maybe the user is trying to be fair to encourage acceptance, but perhaps they're being too generous with the hat.\n\nI should check if the user's previous messages indicated any considerations about the other player's possible valuation. They mentioned in their earlier thinking that they want to leave enough for the other player to accept. But given that the hat is worth 5 points to the user, maybe they should prioritize taking the hat themselves and offering other items.\n\nAlso, it's important to remember that the maximum number of messages is 5, and the user is already at their final proposal. The previous interaction showed an initial strategy where the user considered taking 2 candies and 1 fruit but then shifted to taking the hat and 2 candies. It seems like they're trying different approaches.\n\nIn their final proposal, the user is being specific about the split, leaving the hat and some items for the other player. But considering their own high value on the hat, perhaps they should ensure they take the hat themselves. Otherwise, the other player might be getting more value than the user realizes.\n\nI think the user's proposal is aiming for a balanced distribution, but they might not be accounting for the strategic importance of the hat. Maybe suggesting a different split where the user takes the hat and offers more candies or fruits could be more beneficial.\n\nBut since this is their final proposal, perhaps they're confident it's the best they can do within the constraints. They might be hoping the other player accepts to avoid getting zero points if the negotiation fails.\n\nIn summary, I think the user is trying to be reasonable and ensure both parties get some value, but they might be undervaluing the importance of securing the hat for themselves, given its high personal value. However, their approach is strategic in trying to be fair to encourage agreement.\n"

The goal is to maximize my own score based on the value I place on each type of item. My secret values are: candy is worth 2 points, fruit is also worth 2 points, and the hat is worth 0 points. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how valuable each item is to me and how that might compare to what the other player values. Since the hat is worthless to me, getting it doesn't help me at all, but the candies and fruits are each worth 2 points. This means I really want to secure as many candies and fruits as possible.\n\nGiven there are 3 candies and 2 fruits, the total value for me would ideally be 3 candies (3 x 2 = 6 points) and 2 fruits (2 x 2 = 4 points), totaling 10 points. But I have to share these with the other player, so I need to find a split that benefits both of us.\n\nI should consider what the other player might want. Since I don't know their exact values, I have to assume they might also value candies and fruits highly, and possibly the hat. Maybe the hat is very valuable to them, or maybe not. To ensure they accept the proposal, I should offer them something they might value.\n\nIf I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, that would give me 2 x 2 + 1 x 2 = 6 points. Then, the remaining would be 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat for the other player. That seems fair because they still get some value, especially if the hat is important to them.\n\nAlternatively, I could take 1 hat and 2 candies, which would give me 2 x 2 + 1 x 0 = 4 points. Then, the other player would get 1 candy, 1 fruit, and possibly the remaining value from the hat. But since the hat is worthless to me, it might be worth more to them, making this a reasonable split.\n\nI have to decide which option is more likely to get accepted. Offering them the hat might seem less valuable to me, but it could be a significant offering for them. On the other hand, giving them 1 candy and 1 fruit ensures they get some real value regardless of the hat's worth to them.\n\nIn the end, taking 1 hat and 2 candies while leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit for them seems like a balanced proposal. It gives me a good number of high-value items and offers the other player enough to consider accepting instead of rejecting and risking getting nothing if the proposals don't align.\n\nSo, I'll go with that approach and see how the other player responds before deciding to finalize the proposal.\n"

            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing this negotiation game where me and another player have to divide up some items. There are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret values are: candy is worth 1 point, fruit is also 1 point, and the hat is worth 5 points. The goal is to maximize my score, but I have to send messages to the other player to agree on the split. We can send up to 5 messages, but we can also make a secret proposal at any time. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points based on our values; otherwise, we both get zero.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to figure out what's the best way to split these items to maximize my score. Since the hat is worth the most to me, I definitely want that. Then, I also want as many candies as possible because candy is worth 1 point each, similar to fruits. But since the hat is worth way more, that's a priority.\n\nBut I also have to consider what the other player might think. They might also value the hat highly, or maybe they don't. There's no way to know since the value functions are secret. So I need to propose a split that gives me the hat and some other items in a way that the other player might find acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate how much each item is worth to me in total. The hat is 5 points, each candy is 1 point, and each fruit is 1 point. So the total points available from me are 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (hat plus three candies and two fruits) which equals 10 points.\n\nBut of course, these are my values; the other player might value them differently. Since we both have different value functions, I need to find a way to divide the items such that both of us can be satisfied enough to accept, but obviously, I want to maximize my own points.\n\nIf I take the hat, that's 5 points right there. Then, I also want to take as many candies and fruits as I can. Let's see: 1 hat, 2 candies, and 2 fruits would give me 5 + 2 + 2 = 9 points. But hold on, there are only 3 candies and 2 fruits in total, so taking 2 of each would leave only 1 candy for the other player.\n\nBut that might not be attractive for the other player because they might want more. Maybe offering them a bit more in terms of candies and fruits while I keep the high-value hat would make them more likely to accept.\n\nSo maybe I can take 1 hat and 2 candies, leaving 1 candy and 2 fruits for them. That way, I get 5 + 2 = 7 points, and they have 1 + 2 = 3 points. Hmm, that seems a bit lopsided. Maybe I should balance it a bit more.\n\nIf I take 1 hat, 1 candy, and 1 fruit, that would be 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 points for me, and they would get 2 candies and 1 fruit, which is 2 + 1 = 3 points. Still, it's not very balanced.\n\nWait, maybe I should just take the hat and leave the candies and fruits for the other player. But that way, I only get 5 points, and they get 4 points. It’s still a bit in my favor, but not by much.\n\nBut given that the hat is worth 5 points, maybe I should just take that and let them have the candies and fruits. It might be more likely to accept since they might place less value on the hat.\n\nAlternatively, I can try splitting the candies equally. Take 2 candies, 1 fruit, and the hat, which gives me 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 points, leaving them with 1 candy and 1 fruit, which is 2 points. That seems too much in my favor; maybe they wouldn't accept that.\n\nI think a fairer approach would be to take the hat and let them have two candies and one fruit. So my message should reflect that. I'll propose that I take 1 hat and 2 candies, leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit for them. That way, I get 5 + 2 = 7 points, and they get 1 + 1 = 2 points. Maybe that's a good balance because 7 to 2 seems a bit one-sided, but considering the hat is so valuable to me, it's better than them not accepting and both of us getting zero.\n\nI'll phrase it nicely to make it seem like a fair offer. Maybe say something like, \"I propose that I take 1 hat and 2 candies, and you get 1 candy and 1 fruit. Let me know if this works for you.\" That way, it's clear and direct, and the other player can decide if they're okay with that split.\n\nI think this is a good starting point. If they accept, great, we both get our points. If not, I can try adjusting the offer. Maybe offer them an extra candy or fruit if it means they'll accept the deal. But for now, this seems like the best proposal.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to split these items with the other player. We have 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. The goal is to make a proposal that maximizes my score based on my secret value function: candy is worth 2 points, fruit is also 2 points, and the hat is worth nothing. I need to balance taking enough to get a high score but also leave something worthwhile for the other player so they'll accept the deal.\n\nFirst, I want to focus on the items that give me the highest points. Candies and fruits are both valuable to me, each worth 2 points, while the hat doesn't add anything to my score. So, ideally, I'd take as many candies and fruits as possible. However, I don't want to leave the other player with nothing valuable because they might reject the proposal, and then we both end up with zero.\n\nIf I take 2 candies, that's 4 points, and if I also take 1 fruit, that's another 2 points, totaling 6 points for me. That leaves 1 candy and 1 fruit for the other player, which should be enough to make the proposal appealing for them. The hat can go to the other player since it doesn't affect my score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can throw in the hat to make the offer seem more balanced. So, I could ask for 1 hat and 2 candies, which is 2 candies (4 points) and 1 hat (0 points), totaling 4 points for me. This leaves 1 candy, 1 fruit, and 1 hat for the other player. Since the hat doesn't add any value for me, but it might make the proposal seem fairer to the other player, this could work.\n\nI think the key is to make sure that the other player feels like they're getting a decent share, even if the items aren't as valuable to me. So, by offering them 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat, I'm giving them a total of 2 points (from the candy and fruit) while I get 4 points. Or, if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, I get 6 points and leave them with 2 points (1 candy and 1 fruit) plus the hat.\n\nI should also consider that if I take the hat, it doesn't hurt my score, but it might make the other player feel better about the deal because they get something tangible, even if it's not valuable. Conversely, focusing solely on candies and fruits might make the other player feel like they're getting the short end of the stick, which could lead to a rejection.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the proportions. Since there are 3 candies and 2 fruits, it makes sense to allocate them in a way that reflects their quantity. Offering 2 candies and 1 fruit for myself, leaving the rest for the other player, seems reasonable. It shows that I'm taking a larger share but not taking everything, which might make the proposal more acceptable.\n\nI also need to remember that we can send messages back and forth, but there's a limit. I want to make sure I don't spend too many messages negotiating, but also that I adjust based on the other player's responses. If the other player rejects my initial proposal, I might have to tweak it slightly to make it more appealing.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on taking the high-value items—candies and fruits—for myself while leaving enough for the other player seems like the best approach. Offering them 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat should be fair enough for them to accept. If they don't, I can adjust the proposal in the next message to see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.\n"

Okay, so we have 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret value for candy is 1, fruit is 1, and hat is 5. So, the hat is super valuable to me compared to the other items. \n\nI need to send a proposal, but I can only do it once, so I need to make it good. I want to maximize my score based on my values. Let me list out the items with their values:\n\n- Candies: 1 each\n- Fruits: 1 each\n- Hat: 5\n\nIf I take the hat, that's a big win for me because it's worth 5 points. Then, I also want as many candies and fruits as I can get, but I have to leave something for the other player so they'll accept the proposal.\n\nLet's see, if I take the hat, that's already 5 points. Then, if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, my total would be 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 points. That seems pretty good. But I need to check if there are enough items.\n\nThere are 3 candies, so taking 2 leaves 1 candy. There are 2 fruits, taking 1 leaves 1 fruit. And there's only 1 hat.\n\nSo, my proposal would be:\n\nI take the hat (5 points), 2 candies (2 points), and 1 fruit (1 point), totaling 8 points.\n\nThe other player would get 1 candy (1 point) and 1 fruit (1 point), totaling 2 points.\n\nIs that fair enough for them to accept? I mean, it's not very balanced, but I have to think about their possible valuations. Maybe they value the hat less, or maybe they want some candies and fruits more. But from my perspective, I need to maximize my points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should leave them with more items so they're more likely to agree. Let's consider another option: I take the hat and 1 candy, totaling 6 points, and leave them with 2 candies and 1 fruit, which is 3 points. That might be more appealing to them, but I'm giving up 2 points.\n\nBut since my goal is to maximize my score, I should aim for the highest possible while still making the proposal acceptable. The first proposal of me taking the hat and 2 candies and 1 fruit seems better. Let's go with that.\n\nSo, my final proposal is:\n\nI take 1 hat, 2 candies, and 1 fruit.\n\nThis way, I maximize my points based on my value function while leaving some items for the other player.\n\nAlso, I have to make sure I'm following the format correctly when I submit the proposal. It should be in square brackets as:\n\n[Proposal: 1 hat, 2 candies, 1 fruit]\n\nBut in the message, I need to communicate it clearly so the other player understands and hopefully accepts.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to come up with the best possible secret proposal in this negotiation game. Let me start by reviewing the rules and the situation so I can make the most informed decision.\n\nFirst, the available items are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret value function assigns the following scores:\n\n- Candy: 2 points\n- Fruit: 2 points\n- Hat: 0 points\n\nMy goal is to maximize my score by proposes a division of these items between me and the other player. The other player has already submitted their secret proposal, so now it's my turn. If our proposals are complementary (meaning there's enough items to fulfill both), then we both get the points based on what we receive. If not, both of us get zero points.\n\nI think I need to consider what the other player might have proposed to maximize their own points. But since I don't know their secret value function, I have to make an educated guess based on typical strategies. Generally, people try to maximize their own gains, so the other player probably took the items they value most.\n\nGiven that, I need to propose a division that doesn't conflict with their proposal but still gives me the maximum possible score. If both of us have taken different items, we both get points. If we've both taken the same items, it results in both of us getting zero, which is bad for both.\n\nSo, I need to think about what items to ask for to ensure that our proposals are complementary. Let's break it down:\n\nThere are 3 candies, each worth 2 points to me.\nThere are 2 fruits, each worth 2 points to me.\nThere's 1 hat, which is worth 0 points to me, so I don't really care about it.\n\nIf I prioritize candies and fruits since they give me more points, the hat is low value, so it might be a good idea to let the other player take it to make room for me to take more candies or fruits.\n\nSuppose the other player has proposed to take 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving me with 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. That would be a good split because:\n\n- I get 1 candy (2 points) and 1 fruit (2 points), totaling 4 points.\n- The other player gets 2 candies (4 points) and 1 fruit (2 points), totaling 6 points.\n\nBut wait, if I propose the same, we might end up with overlapping proposals, which could lead to both of us getting zero points. So I need to find a split where we don't overlap on any items.\n\nAlternatively, if the other player wants to maximize their points, they might have taken 2 candies and 1 fruit, which are high-value items, leaving me with the remaining candy, fruit, and hat. If I mirror that proposal, it could lead to conflict.\n\nSo, perhaps I should propose to take the hat and one candy, and leave the rest to them. That way, if they took the same, we have overlapping, but if they didn't, we might complement each other. Or maybe it's better to take 2 fruits and 1 candy, but there are only 2 fruits available.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a table to clarify.\n\nAvailable items:\n\n- Candy: 3\n- Fruit: 2\n- Hat: 1\n\nMy valuation:\n\n- Candy: 2 points each\n- Fruit: 2 points each\n- Hat: 0 points\n\nThe total points I can get are based on what I manage to secure.\n\nIf I propose to take 2 candies and 1 fruit, that gives me 2*2 +1*2 = 6 points.\n\nBut the other player might have already taken similar items, so the key is to propose something that doesn't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer a proposal that ensures I get at least 4 points, leaving the rest to the other player.\n\nBut maybe the best strategy is to take what I value most and see if the other player can take the rest without overlapping.\n\nI think I should go with taking 2 candies since they are plentiful (3 available) and 1 fruit since there are 2. That way, I get 6 points, which is the highest possible.\n\nSo my final proposal would be:\n\n\"Proposal: 2 candies, 1 fruit\"\n\nI hope the other player took different items so we both get points.\n"
