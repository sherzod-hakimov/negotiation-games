    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Alright, I&#x27;m in this negotiation game, and I need to figure out how to divide the items so that I maximize my score. Let me start by understanding the rules again. There&#x27;s me and another player, each with a secret value function. The items available are 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, and 2 boxes. My values are: stick worth 5, towel 2, toy 1, and box 1 each.<br/><br/>So, the goal is to agree on dividing these items without knowing the other player&#x27;s values. We can send messages to negotiate, up to 5 each, or make a proposal at any time. Proposals have to be complementary; otherwise, both get zero. If they are complementary, we each get the sum of our values for the items we receive.<br/><br/>Hmm, I should think about what the other player might value since maximizing my score depends on it. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I can make an educated guess based on logic. Or perhaps try to signal what I want and see how they respond.<br/><br/>First, let&#x27;s note the total items: 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, 2 boxes, so total 5 items, but boxes are 2, so it&#x27;s stick, towel, toy, box, box.<br/><br/>My goal is to get the items that give me the highest value. The stick is the most valuable to me at 5 points, followed by towel at 2, then toy and box both at 1. So I really want the stick, then towel, then toy, and box.<br/><br/>If I could, I&#x27;d take the stick and maybe the towel or toy, but I have to leave something for the other player. Otherwise, if both propose and they aren&#x27;t complementary, we both get zero. So it&#x27;s a balance between being greedy and ensuring that there&#x27;s enough for both.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible splits. The stick is unique, so one person gets it, the other doesn&#x27;t. The towel and toy are unique, so similar situation. Boxes are two, so can be split.<br/><br/>If I can get the stick, that&#x27;s 5 points, which is significant. Then, what else can I get? Maybe a box or the towel or toy.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values the stick highly, but I don&#x27;t know. So perhaps I should try to offer them something in exchange. Maybe propose a split where they get the towel or toy and a box, and I take the stick and the other item.<br/><br/>Wait, but we need to make sure that our proposals don&#x27;t overlap. So maybe I can suggest taking the stick and a box, and they take the towel, toy, and the other box. Or perhaps I take the stick and the towel, and they take the toy and both boxes.<br/><br/>I think starting by suggesting a fair split might be a good idea. Let me try to send a message to the other player proposing a division. Let me first send them a message.<br/><br/>Let me consider possible offers. If I send them a message asking what they want, maybe they&#x27;ll hint at their preferences.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps it&#x27;s better to make a proposal that maximizes my minimum gain. Since the stick is the most valuable to me, I can offer them the items that are least valuable to me.<br/><br/>So, I can propose taking the stick and the towel, which gives me 5+2=7 points, leaving them with the toy and two boxes (1+1+1=3). But that might not be optimal because maybe the other player values the towel or toy more. If they value the towel higher than I do, perhaps they would rather have the towel and some boxes.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take the stick, leaving the towel, toy, and two boxes for them. But I only need to ensure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items when combined with theirs.<br/><br/>Wait, no, because proposals are secret. So I can&#x27;t see theirs. So perhaps I should aim for a safe split that ensures that if they accept, both get some points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can take the stick and one box, which gives me 5+1=6, and leave them with towel (2), toy (1), and one box (1), totaling 4. That&#x27;s a reasonable split, but perhaps I can do better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the stick and the towel (total 7), and leave them with toy and two boxes (3), that&#x27;s better for me, but maybe the other player won&#x27;t accept because they get less.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the game, the other player&#x27;s score isn&#x27;t known to me, so I can&#x27;t base it on that. I have to propose a split that doesn&#x27;t conflict, regardless of their values. The only thing that matters is whether the total items in both proposals don&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>So, my proposal needs to be such that for each item type, the sum of what I take and what they take doesn&#x27;t exceed the available quantity.<br/><br/>Since we&#x27;re both making secret proposals, we have to make sure that our combined proposals don&#x27;t take more than what&#x27;s available. So, for example, if I propose taking 2 boxes, and they also propose taking 2 boxes, that would conflict because there&#x27;s only 2 boxes. So in that case, both get zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that could potentially be compatible. So maybe I can take the stick and one box, leaving them with the towel, toy, and one box. That&#x27;s a possible path.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can take the stick and the towel, leaving them with toy and two boxes. That would total my 7 vs their 1+1+1=3. But again, if they take the towel as part of their proposal, it might conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but the proposals are secret, so if I propose the stick and the towel, and they propose the stick and something else, both of our stick requests would clash, and we&#x27;d both get zero. So it&#x27;s risky to take the stick unless I can ensure that the other player doesn&#x27;t take it.<br/><br/>So perhaps a safer approach is to take items that are less likely to be taken by the other player. But since I don&#x27;t know their preferences, I have to assume they might take the highest value items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps offering a split that&#x27;s mutually beneficial. For example, if I take the stick and a box, and they take the towel, toy, and the other box. That way, both can get some points without overlapping. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 stick, 1 box], leaving them with towel, toy, and 1 box.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take the stick and the towel, but that&#x27;s risky because if they also take the stick, we both get zero. So maybe the safer bet is to take just the stick and a box, which leaves them with the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could try to take the stick, towel, and a box, leaving them with a toy and a box. But that would be 5+2+1=8 for me, leaving them with 1+1=2. But if they take the stick or towel, we might overlap.<br/><br/>Hmm. So the optimal approach is to choose the items that give me the highest value without overlapping with what the other player might take. But since I don&#x27;t know their priorities, perhaps focusing on the stick is the best because it&#x27;s worth the most to me.<br/><br/>So, maybe I can send a message suggesting a split where I take the stick and a box, and they take the towel, toy, and the other box. That way, we both get some points, and there&#x27;s no overlap.<br/><br/>Let me try sending that as a message. So, my message would be: &quot;I propose we split the items as follows: I take the stick and a box, and you take the towel, toy, and the remaining box. That way, we both get some items without overlap.&quot;<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t use markdown, I have to write it without the square brackets when sending a message. So, I&#x27;ll write: I propose we split the items as follows: I take 1 stick and 1 box, and you take 1 towel, 1 toy, and 1 box.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe they might not accept that. They might want the stick more. So perhaps I should propose taking the stick and towel, but that&#x27;s risky. Alternatively, perhaps I should just go ahead and make a proposal without negotiating, but I have to consider the risk.<br/><br/>Wait, I can only send up to 5 messages, so maybe I can start by offering my proposal, and see if they respond. Alternatively, perhaps just make the proposal directly.<br/><br/>Wait, the instructions say that to make a proposal, I have to send it in the secret proposal format, which is [Proposal: ...]. But when sending messages, I shouldn&#x27;t use square brackets, as that would be a proposal.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I should send a message indicating my proposed split, and then wait for their response. If they don&#x27;t respond, I can proceed to make the formal proposal. Alternatively, I can just make the proposal now.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should try to see if they are willing to give me the stick, perhaps offering them the boxes in exchange.<br/><br/>Wait, but boxes are less valuable to me, so keeping them as bargaining chips could be useful.<br/><br/>Hmm, I&#x27;m a bit torn. Maybe it&#x27;s better to make a reasonable proposal that maximizes my score while leaving enough for the other player so that they don&#x27;t reject it. Since the stick is so valuable to me, I should try to get that, and perhaps a box, and leave the rest for them.<br/><br/>So, my proposal would be: 1 stick and 1 box, which gives me 5+1=6 points. They would get 1 towel, 1 toy, and 1 box, which is 2+1+1=4. But I don&#x27;t know their values, so maybe they value the towel and toy more, which would make this a better deal for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the stick and the towel (5+2=7), and leave them with the toy and two boxes (1+1+1=3), but if they also want the stick, we&#x27;ll both get zero. So it&#x27;s a bit risky.<br/><br/>I think the safer approach is to take the stick and a box, ensuring that I get at least 6 points, while leaving them with the rest. That way, even if they take the stick in their proposal, but since I&#x27;ve taken one, but there&#x27;s only one stick, so if they also take it, we both get zero. So maybe taking the stick is a bit risky.<br/><br/>Wait, wait a second. The item quantities are: stick:1, towel:1, toy:1, box:2.<br/><br/>So if I propose taking 1 stick, and they also propose taking 1 stick, then we both took the stick, which is only one, so it&#x27;s impossible, leading to both getting zero. Therefore, taking the stick is a high-risk move because if both take it, we both get nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can avoid taking the stick to ensure that I get something. But the stick is worth 5 points, which is too valuable to pass up. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to take the stick, even with the risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can wait for the other player to make a proposal, but that might not be possible since both can terminate early.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose taking the stick, towel, and a box (total 5+2+1=8), and leave them with the toy and one box (1+1=2). But again, if they take any of the items I took, we both get zero.<br/><br/>Wait, but they might have a different valuation where the towel or toy is more valuable, so perhaps it&#x27;s better to focus on the stick.<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe the optimal strategy is to take the stick and a box, as that gives me 6 points, and leaves them with enough to possibly not conflict. Alternatively, I can just take the stick, but that leaves me with only 5 points, but ensures that if the other player took something else, it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s think about it in terms of possible scenarios. If I take the stick (5), and they take the towel (2?), and then the boxes and toy are left (3). So total for me 5, for them 2 plus maybe 1,1,1 (if they take all the remaining). But it&#x27;s unclear.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take the stick and towel, that&#x27;s 7, and they take the toy and both boxes, which gives me 7, them 1+1+1=3. If they value the toy or boxes more, they might accept.<br/><br/>But again, the risk is that if they also take the stick, it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should consider that the other player might also think the stick is the most valuable, so they might take it as well. If both of us take the stick, we both get zero, which is worse. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to take the items that are less likely to be taken by the other player.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can suggest a split where I take the stick and they take the towel, toy, and boxes. But if I send a message proposing that, but they might not respond. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to just make a proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should make a proposal that takes the stick and a box, hoping that they don&#x27;t take the stick. So my proposal is:<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 stick, 1 box]<br/><br/>That way, I get 5+1=6 points, and they get towel (2), toy (1), and 1 box (1), totaling 4. So it&#x27;s a reasonable split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to increase my score, I could take the stick and towel, but that&#x27;s 7 points, but the risk is higher.<br/><br/>Given the risk, perhaps it&#x27;s better to secure 6 points rather than risk getting zero. Especially since the other player is likely to value the stick as well.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s values are secret, so maybe they don&#x27;t value the stick that much. Suppose they don&#x27;t, then taking the stick is safe. But if they do, I might be in trouble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player values the boxes more because there are two of them, so maybe they have a higher combined value. But in my values, boxes are 1 each, so 2 boxes would be 2, but the stick is 5, which is higher.<br/><br/>Hmm. Alternatively, I could try to send a message to the other player offering to take the stick and a box, and see if they accept. If they reject, I might have to adjust.<br/><br/>Wait, but since they can only send messages, and I can&#x27;t see their messages unless they respond. So maybe I should send a message offering a split.<br/><br/>Let me try that. I&#x27;ll message them: &quot;I propose we split the items so that I take the stick and a box, and you take the towel, toy, and the other box.&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, we both get some points. If not, maybe we can negotiate further.<br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t respond, or decline, I might have to adjust my proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take the stick, towel, and a box, and leave them with the toy and a box. That gives me 8 points, them 2 points. But again, if they take the stick or towel, it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>I think the safest bet is to take the stick and a box (6 points), ensuring that I don&#x27;t clash on the stick if they also take it. Wait, no, because if they take the stick, my proposal includes it, so we both took the stick, which is impossible, leading to zero. So taking the stick is risky.<br/><br/>Wait, wait, I think I&#x27;m miscalculating. If I propose taking 1 stick, and they also propose taking 1 stick, then our proposals are overlapping on the stick, so both get zero. So, to avoid that, perhaps I should not take the stick.<br/><br/>But the stick is worth 5 points, which is a lot. Alternatively, maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t value the stick as much, so they might not take it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take the towel, toy, and both boxes, leaving the stick for them. Then, I get 2+1+1+1=5, but that&#x27;s worse than taking the stick.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take the stick and one box, and leave the rest. That way, if they take the stick, we conflict, but if not, I get 6 points.<br/><br/>I think I have to take the risk. Let me propose taking 1 stick and 1 box.<br/><br/>So, my proposal is: [Proposal: 1 stick, 1 box]<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let me try to figure out the best proposal I can make. First, I should consider the items available and my own value function. There&#x27;s 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, and 2 boxes. My values are stick:7, towel:3, toy:0, box:0. So, I really value the stick and the towel, and the other items don&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player has already made a secret proposal. Since their proposal is secret, I don&#x27;t know what they took, but I need to make a complementary proposal. That means whatever I choose shouldn&#x27;t overlap with what they&#x27;ve chosen, and there should be enough items for both of us.<br/><br/>I should think about possible scenarios. If the other player took the stick, then I could take the towel. If they took the towel, I could take the stick. But since there&#x27;s only one stick and one towel, if they took both, that&#x27;s not possible because there&#x27;s only one of each. Alternatively, maybe they took one of them and some boxes. Since the boxes are worth nothing to me, maybe I can take the higher value item and let them have the rest.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve taken. Maybe the best approach is to take the highest value items that complement their proposal. Since the stick is worth the most to me at 7, I should prioritize getting that. If they didn&#x27;t take the stick, I should take it. But if they did take the stick, I should take the towel.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe I should assume they also went for the highest value items. If I propose the stick, and they also proposed the stick, then our proposals would conflict, and we both get zero. That&#x27;s bad. Alternatively, maybe they took the towel, so I can take the stick.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should try to take the stick and towel, but there are only one each, so if I take both, the other player would have to take the boxes, which are two. But the problem is, if I take both the stick and towel, and the other player only wants one of them, that might cause a conflict. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should take the stick only. Let&#x27;s see. If I take the stick, that&#x27;s one item. Then the other player could take the towel and some boxes. Since their proposal has to be complementary, they can&#x27;t take the stick if I took it. So if I take the stick, they can take the towel and maybe a box or two. But since boxes are worth nothing to me, that&#x27;s fine. Alternatively, if I take the towel, they can take the stick.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player also wants the stick because it&#x27;s the highest value. So perhaps their proposal includes the stick. If I propose the stick and they did too, we both get zero. So maybe I should propose the towel instead, in case they took the stick, that way at least I get the towel. But if they didn&#x27;t take the towel, then my proposal would include it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should think about how to maximize my minimum outcome. If I take the stick, and if the other player didn&#x27;t, great, I get 7 points. If they did take the stick, I get zero. If I take the towel, and they took the stick, I get 3 points. If they took the towel, I get zero. So perhaps taking the towel is safer because 3 is better than zero, but 7 is higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take both stick and towel, but that&#x27;s two items. But if the other player also took one of them, then we&#x27;d have overlapping. So that&#x27;s risky because it might cause a conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player could have taken both stick and towel, but there&#x27;s only one each, so that&#x27;s impossible. So if I take both, and they took one, that would cause conflict. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to take just the stick.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the stick, and the other player took the towel, then that works. Each gets one, and boxes are left. So that&#x27;s complementary. If the other player took the stick, then my proposal conflicts, and we both get zero. But if I took the towel, maybe they didn&#x27;t take the stick, so I get 3.<br/><br/>Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should take both stick and towel, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s complementary. If I take both, and the other player took anything else, it&#x27;s okay because there are two boxes. But if I take both, and the other player also took one of them, then it&#x27;s a conflict. So perhaps I should just take the stick.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could try to take the stick and a box, but since boxes are worth zero, that doesn&#x27;t help me. So better just take the stick.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go with taking the stick as my proposal because it&#x27;s the highest value. If the other player didn&#x27;t take it, I get 7 points. If they did, I get zero, but I have a better chance of getting 7 points.<br/></p>
