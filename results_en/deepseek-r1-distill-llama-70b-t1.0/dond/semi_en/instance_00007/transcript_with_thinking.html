    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m playing this negotiation game where I have to divide some items with another player. The items available are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, and 2 cups. My secret value function is: wire: 1, glass: 0, needle: 0, cup: 4. So, I really value cups the most, and wires a bit, while glasses and needles don&#x27;t matter to me at all.<br/><br/>First, I need to figure out how to approach this. I can send up to 5 messages, but I can also make a secret proposal at any time. The goal is to maximize my score, which is based on the items I get. If both proposals are complementary, meaning we can both get what we want without overlapping, we each get points based on our own values. If not, both get zero.<br/><br/>So, my priority is to get as many cups as possible because each cup gives me 4 points, which is the highest value for me. Wires give me 1 point each, but the others give me nothing. I have to decide how many cups and wires I can take.<br/><br/>I know the other player might also have their own preferences, which I don&#x27;t know. So, maybe I should start by trying to find out what they value. But I can&#x27;t ask directly, so I have to infer based on their messages.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s value function. Maybe I should make an initial proposal to see how they react. Let me think: there are 2 cups. If I propose taking both cups, what would happen? The other player might reject because they might want some cups for themselves or maybe they don&#x27;t care. But if I take both cups and maybe one wire, leaving the rest for them, maybe they&#x27;ll accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should offer a proposal that gives them something they want in exchange for me getting the cups. But without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s a bit tricky. Maybe I should start by suggesting a split and see how they respond.<br/><br/>Another approach is to think about the total points. If I take both cups, that&#x27;s 8 points. If I take two cups and a wire, that&#x27;s 8 +1=9. But maybe the other player wants wires too. So maybe I can offer them the wires and keep the cups.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take both cups, the other player could take the wires, but I have to check if they can do that without overlapping. Let me think about the total items:<br/><br/>Total items: 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, 2 cups.<br/><br/>If I propose: [Proposal: 2 cups, 0 wires, 0 glasses, 0 needles] that would take both cups, leaving 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles for the other player. But if the other player also wants wires, they might propose taking wires, but if their proposal is complementary, we both get points.<br/><br/>But wait, if I take both cups, and the other player takes both wires, then 2 cups and 2 wires are taken, leaving glasses and needles, but glasses and needles are 0 value to both? Or maybe to them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player doesn&#x27;t care about wires, maybe I can take both cups and some wires, but I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can try to communicate. Maybe send a message saying that I&#x27;m willing to let them have wires and glasses if they let me have the cups. But I have to figure out what they want.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s value function is unknown. So, maybe I should make a safe proposal that maximizes my minimum gain.<br/><br/>So, my best case is taking both cups, which gives me 8 points. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s possible. If I make a proposal for 2 cups and 0 of everything else, then the other player can make a proposal for 2 wires, 0 glasses, 0 needles, 0 cups. Then, as long as both proposals are complementary, we both get our points.<br/><br/>But if the other player also wants cups, they might take 1 cup and 1 wire, and then it&#x27;s possible that our proposals aren&#x27;t complementary. So, maybe I should try to ensure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make a proposal that takes 2 cups and 2 wires, but that would leave 0 for the other player, which is not possible because they need to get something. Wait, no, the proposals must be complementary, i.e., the total taken by both must not exceed the available items.<br/><br/>Wait, in the rules, (d) says if the proposals are complementary, each gets their own items. So, for example, if I propose [2 cups, 1 wire], and the other proposes [1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 needles], then my proposal would take 2 cups and 1 wire, and theirs would take 1 wire (but only 2 wires exist, so 1+1=2 wires). So, this would be complementary because 2+1=3, but wait, wires are only 2. So no, that&#x27;s not complementary. Because I take 1 wire and they take 1 wire, that&#x27;s okay. But if I take 2 cups and 1 wire, that&#x27;s 3 items, but the other takes 1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 needles: total 5 items. So total taken is (2+1)+(1+2+2)= 3 +5=8, but total available is 8 items, so it&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;m not sure about the exact rule.<br/><br/>Wait, the rule says &quot;there are enough items to fulfill both proposals&quot;, meaning that for each item type, the sum of the quantities in both proposals does not exceed the available quantity.<br/><br/>So, for wires: I take x, other takes y; x + y ≤ 2.<br/><br/>Same for cups, glasses, needles.<br/><br/>So, for example, if I take 2 cups and 1 wire, other can take 1 wire and the rest. So x=1 (wires) from me, y=1 (wires) from them: total 2, which is okay.<br/><br/>Therefore, if I propose [2 cups, 1 wire], that would leave 1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 needles. The other player can take 1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 needles. Then both can be fulfilled.<br/><br/>But if I take 2 cups and 2 wires, the other can&#x27;t take anything else because wires would be exhausted. But the other might propose taking glasses or needles, which I don&#x27;t care about. Wait, but I have to make sure that their proposal, when combined with mine, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>So, if I take 2 cups and 2 wires, then the other player can take 2 glasses and 2 needles, which is complementary. So in that case, if their proposal is [2 glasses, 2 needles], that&#x27;s fine.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 cups and 1 wire, leaving 1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 needles. Then the other can take 1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 needles.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should propose taking as much as I can without blocking the other player from making a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, perhaps I should try to take the items I value most and see if they are willing to accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should communicate with them to find a mutually beneficial split. But since I can&#x27;t ask directly, maybe I can make offers.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the initial prompt, the user is me, thinking through the process, so I&#x27;m the one making the proposal. So perhaps I should just go ahead and make a proposal.<br/><br/>My plan: Since cups give me the most value, I want as many as possible. There are 2, so I should aim for both. Wires give me 1 each, but I can take up to 2 if possible.<br/><br/>But if I take 2 cups and 0 wires, the other can take 2 wires, 0 others. So my score would be 8, theirs would be 2 (assuming they value wires as 1 each).<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 cups and 1 wire, that&#x27;s 8 +1=9, and the other takes 1 wire, and the rest (glasses and needles), which they might value higher or not.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, taking 2 cups and 1 wire might be a good balance. Alternatively, take 2 cups and 2 wires, which gives me 10 points, but that&#x27;s if the other doesn&#x27;t mind taking nothing but glasses and needles.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 cups, the other can take 2 wires and maybe glasses and needles, but as long as it&#x27;s complementary, we both get points.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best approach is to take 2 cups and 0 wires, and see if the other can take 2 wires.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take 2 cups, the other can take 2 wires, and then both get points. That seems good for me because I get 8, they get 2. But if the other is okay with that, it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 cups and 1 wire, I get 8 +1=9, and the other can take 1 wire, but they might prefer that.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the rules, each player&#x27;s score is based on their own value function. So if I take 2 cups, I get 8, and the other takes 2 wires, if their value for wires is high, they might be happy with that.<br/><br/>But if the other values cups more than I do, they might not agree to let me have both cups. So, perhaps I should try to get as many cups as possible while offering the other some wires, but I&#x27;m not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should make a proposal for 2 cups and 1 wire, and see if they accept that by making a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, I can only make one secret proposal, but we can negotiate via messages first. Wait, no, we can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time.<br/><br/>But in this case, since I&#x27;m the one thinking, I have to figure out what to do.<br/><br/>Given that, I think the optimal strategy is to take both cups and as many wires as possible without preventing the other player from making a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>So, taking 2 cups and 2 wires would give me the maximum value, but then the other player can&#x27;t take any wires, but might take the glasses and needles, which I don&#x27;t care about.<br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value function has value for glasses or needles, they might prefer that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can take 2 cups and 1 wire, allowing the other player to take 1 wire and the rest.<br/><br/>Wait, but without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s hard to know. So perhaps it&#x27;s safer to maximize my own value, so I should take both cups and as many wires as possible, making sure that their proposal can be complementary.<br/><br/>So, if I take 2 cups and 2 wires, the other can take 0 cups, 0 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles.<br/><br/>If that&#x27;s acceptable to both, we both get our respective points. But if the other player values cups more, they might not accept, and my proposal might be rejected, leading both of us to get zero.<br/><br/>But given that I don&#x27;t know their value function, it&#x27;s a risk. So perhaps a safer approach is to take 1 cup and 2 wires, allowing the other to take 1 cup and maybe some wires or others.<br/><br/>Wait, but my value for cups is much higher. So, perhaps it&#x27;s better to go for both cups and see what happens.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can try to see if the other player responds to an offer. Wait, but I&#x27;m the one making the proposal; I can&#x27;t negotiate back and forth.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can send a message first to the other player, like &quot;I want to take the cups. What do you want?&quot; But since I can&#x27;t ask directly, maybe I can send a message saying &quot;I propose taking the cups, you take the rest.&quot; But I have to be cautious.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the rules, the secret proposal is the only thing that matters. The messages are just to communicate. So, the actual negotiation is done through messages, but the final decision is the secret proposal.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I should send a message suggesting a split, like &quot;Let me take the 2 cups, and you can take the wires, glasses, and needles.&quot; If the other player agrees, they can make a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>But if I send that message, and the other player makes a proposal that takes the wires, that&#x27;s good. But if they refuse, we both get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a more modest proposal. Let me think: I take 1 cup and 1 wire, and they take the rest. But then I get 4 +1=5, which is less than if I take both cups.<br/><br/>But perhaps that&#x27;s safer, as the other player might be more likely to accept.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take 2 cups and 0 wires, the other can take 2 wires and get value for that. So, perhaps I can take 2 cups, and the other takes 2 wires, which could be a win-win.<br/><br/>But if the other player has a higher value for cups, they might not accept, leading to both getting zero.<br/><br/>I think the best way is to go for the maximum I can get, which is 2 cups and 2 wires, making my proposal as [Proposal: 2 cups, 2 wires]. Then, the other player can take the remaining 2 glasses and 2 needles, if they value those.<br/><br/>If they value glasses and needles, they might accept. If they don&#x27;t, they might reject and we both get zero. But given that, I think it&#x27;s worth trying.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should take 2 cups and 1 wire, leaving 1 wire for the other, which might make it easier for them to accept, as they can take 1 wire and the rest.<br/><br/>But I think taking both cups and both wires gives me the highest possible score, and it&#x27;s complementary because the other can take the remaining items.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll make the proposal for 2 cups and 2 wires.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see... I need to come up with a proposal that maximizes my score based on my value function. The items available are two wires, two glasses, two needles, and two cups. My values are: wire:1, glass:2, needle:2, cup:0. So, I want as many glasses and needles as possible since they give me higher points.<br/><br/>The other player already submitted a secret proposal, so I don&#x27;t know what they took. But I need to make sure my proposal complements theirs. That means the items I request shouldn&#x27;t overlap with what they took, otherwise, we both get zero.<br/><br/>Considering the total counts: 2 of each item. If I take 2 needles and 2 glasses, that&#x27;s four items. Then maybe the other player took wires and cups. My score would be 2*2 (needles) + 2*2 (glasses) = 4 + 4 = 8. But wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal could vary. Maybe they took some of the high-value items too.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 1 glass and 1 needle, that&#x27;s 2 points each, totaling 4 points. But maybe I can get more. Since I can take up to all available, I should go for the maximum that doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but if the other player took some high-value items, I need to avoid those. Since I don&#x27;t know what they took, I have to make a guess. Maybe I should go for the items I value most.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should take 2 needles and 2 glasses, but if the other player took some of those, my proposal won&#x27;t complement. So, maybe split it differently. Like 1 wire, 1 glass, 1 needle, and 1 cup? But cups are worth 0, so no point.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 2 wires and 2 needles, but wires are only worth 1 each. So 2 wires give me 2 points, and 2 needles give me 4. Total 6 points.<br/><br/>But if I take 2 glasses and 2 needles, that&#x27;s 8 points, which is better. I&#x27;ll go with that, hoping the other player didn&#x27;t take those. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 needles, 2 glasses].<br/></p>
