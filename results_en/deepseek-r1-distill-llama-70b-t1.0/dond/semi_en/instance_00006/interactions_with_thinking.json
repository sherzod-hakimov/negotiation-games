                    "content": "Alright, let's try to figure out the best way to split these items to maximize my score. I have 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My values are apple:1, soap:3, egg:4. The other player's values are unknown, but I need to negotiate a deal where both of us get complementary proposals.\n\nFirst, I should consider what each item is worth to me. The egg is the most valuable, worth 4 points, followed by the soap at 3, and apples at 1 each. So, ideally, I\u2019d want the egg and maybe the soap to get the highest possible score.\n\nSince there's only one egg, if I can get that, I can already have 4 points. The soap is also a single item, so that might be a point of contention. The apples are three in number, which might be easier to split, but they\u2019re not as valuable.\n\nI need to think about what the other player might value. They might have their own preferences, maybe they really want the egg or the soap as well. If the other player values the soap highly, they might be willing to trade an apple or the egg for it. Alternatively, if they don\u2019t care much for the soap, maybe they\u2019re more interested in the egg or the apples.\n\nI should consider sending a message to the other player to initiate negotiation. Maybe suggest a split. Let me see. If I offer to take the egg and soap, that would give me 4 + 3 = 7 points. But that leaves the other player with the 3 apples, which are worth 3 points total. But if the other player values apples more, maybe they prefer that. Alternatively, I could suggest taking 2 apples and the egg, which is 2 + 4 = 6 points, leaving them with 1 apple, the soap, and the egg? Wait, no\u2014if I take 2 apples and the egg, the other player gets 1 apple and the soap. That would be 1 + 3 = 4 points for them. That might be better for both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should let them propose first. But since I have the initiative, I should make the first offer. Let me propose taking the egg and the soap. That way, I get 7 points, and they get 3 apples. But maybe they\u2019re okay with that because 3 apples are better than nothing. Alternatively, if they have a higher value for apples, they might not be happy with that. But I have to start somewhere.\n\nSo, I\u2019d send a message like: \"I propose we split the items as follows: I take 1 egg and 1 soap, and you take the 3 apples. That way, both of us get something valuable.\"\n\nIf they agree, I get 4 + 3 = 7 points, and they get 3 apples. But if they refuse, maybe I can adjust. Perhaps I could offer them more apples or see if they prefer the soap. Alternatively, if they want the egg, I might have to negotiate differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should think quantitatively. The total value to me is 3*1 +1*3 +1*4 = 3+3+4=10 points. If I get the egg and the soap, I have 7, leaving them with 3 apples worth 3 points. Alternatively, if I take egg and two apples, that's 4 + 2 = 6, leaving them with 1 apple and the soap, which is 1 + 3 = 4 points. So both cases they get at least 3 or 4 points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want more than that. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should try a different approach. Maybe ask them what they prefer or see if they have any preferences.\n\nBut since I'm trying to maximize my own points, perhaps I should aim for the highest possible. So maybe my initial offer should be taking the egg and the soap. But perhaps I can also leave room for negotiation. Maybe I can say, \"I would like the egg and the soap. If you want more, I can give you some apples.\"\n\nWait, but the other player might not respond, or might not accept. So, I need to find a balance. Maybe I should offer a split that is fair in terms of number of items but also in terms of value. But since my values are secret, it's tricky.\n\nAnother approach: since there are 3 apples, I could propose taking 2 apples and the egg, and offer the soap to them. So I get 2 +4=6, and they get 1 apple and the soap, which is 1 +3=4. But if the other player values the soap more than the 3 apples, maybe they'd prefer that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can suggest taking the egg and two apples, and let them have the soap and one apple. That way, I have 4 + 2 =6, and they have 1 +3=4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just take the egg and let them have the rest. That would give me 4, and them 3 +1 +1=5 (assuming the soap is 3 and apples are 1 each, but that's my values, not theirs). So perhaps that's better for them, but worse for me.\n\nI think I should go ahead and propose taking the egg and the soap, and let them have the apples. Then, if they accept, I get 7 points, which is great. If they reject, I can try a different split.\n\nSo, my message would be: \"I propose that I take 1 egg and 1 soap, and you take the 3 apples. Let me know if this works for you.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should offer a different split first. Maybe take 1 egg and 2 apples, giving them 1 apple and 1 soap. That way, I get 4 +2=6, and they get 1 +3=4. Maybe they prefer having the soap and an apple over just the apples.\n\nBut I don't know. Since I have to send the proposal in the secret message, but in the meantime, I can send up to 5 messages. So perhaps I should first send a message asking if they're open to negotiation, then propose.\n\nWait, but the instructions say that only the secret proposal is to be in the format [Proposal: ...], and other messages are sent normally. So I can send messages like \"Let's discuss how to split the items.\" or \"What would you like to take?\"\n\nBut to maximize my own score, maybe I should just go ahead and make a proposal that benefits me the most, and see if they accept. If they don't, I can adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of possible splits where both of us get items we value more.\n\nWait, perhaps the other player values something else. For example, maybe they value the soap at a higher value. So if I take the soap, I get 3 points, but if they take it, they might get more. So maybe a better strategy is to let them have the soap and take the egg, but that would mean I get 4, and they get 3. But then the apples are left. Maybe I can take 2 apples and give them 1. So my total would be 4 +2=6, and theirs would be 1 +3=4. That could be a fair split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the egg and an apple, and let them have the soap and 2 apples. So I get 4 +1=5, and they get 3 +2=5. That's equal, but maybe not optimal for me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal for me is to take the egg and the soap, giving me 7, and leaving them with 3 apples (value 3). So 7 vs 3. But if the other player has a higher value for the soap, maybe they won't agree.\n\nI think I need to make an initial proposal that gives me the highest possible, and if they reject, adjust accordingly. So I'll propose taking the egg and the soap. Let me draft the message.\n\nMessage to send: \"I propose we split the items as follows: I take the egg and the soap, and you take the 3 apples. Let me know what you think.\"\n\nIf they accept, great. If not, I'll have to negotiate further. Maybe I can offer to give them one apple instead, but that would lower my points. Alternatively, maybe I can take the egg and two apples, and let them have the soap and one apple.\n\nBut in the first message, I think the best is to go for the highest possible, so I'll propose the egg and soap.\n"

My secret value function is apple: 0, soap: 7, egg: 3. That means I don't care about apples, but I really want the soap and also value the egg.\n\nThe goal is to maximize my score based on the items I receive. The rules say that I can send messages, up to 5 each, or make a secret proposal at any time. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points; otherwise, we both get zero.\n\nSo, I need to strategize on how to approach this. Let me think about what my best move is. Since apples are worth nothing to me, I can safely offer them to the other player. But the soap is super valuable\u2014I get 7 points for it. The egg is worth 3, which is still better than nothing, but not as much as the soap.\n\nI want to maximize my points, so ideally, I want both the soap and the egg. But the other player might also want the soap. If I can get the soap, that's a huge win. If not, I'd settle for the egg. But if I can get both, that's even better.\n\nIn my initial message, I offered the other player the apples in exchange for me taking the soap and egg. But the other player might not accept if, for example, their highest value is on the soap as well. So maybe they rejected the proposal.\n\nNow, it's their turn. They sent a message. Hmm, I need to figure out what they're thinking. They might be trying to get the soap for themselves, so maybe they're offering me the egg and some apples, but keeping the soap. Alternatively, they could be suggesting a different split.\n\nWait, in the message, they wrote: \"I propose we split them as follows: I take the egg, and you take the soap and the 3 apples. Let me know what you think.\" So they\u2019re proposing that they take the egg, and I get the soap and apples.\n\nFrom my perspective, the soap is worth 7, which is more than the egg's 3, so getting the soap is better. If I can secure the soap, I get 7 points, which is better than getting the egg which is 3. So if I agree, I get 7 points, and they get 3. That seems good for me, but maybe I can get both.\n\nBut considering that if I don't agree, maybe we end up not getting any points because our proposals aren't complementary. So it's a risk. If I can get the soap and some apples, that's 7+0=7. If I try to take both the soap and egg, I might risk the other player not agreeing, and then both of us get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player\u2019s value function is different. Let's assume they have their own values\u2014maybe they place high value on the egg. If I can let them have the egg, and I take the soap, that would be better for me than both of us getting nothing.\n\nSo, considering all this, accepting their offer might be the best move. I get the soap (7 points), they get the egg (which I value at 3, but their value could be higher, so maybe they're okay with that). The apples are just thrown in, which is fine as they don't affect my score. This way, we both get points. If I were to propose a different split, like me taking both the soap and the egg, they might not agree because that would leave them with only apples, which might be worthless to them, making them prefer to reject and both get zero.\n\nSo, accepting their proposal seems safer and still gives me a good score.\n"

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the items available and their quantities. There are 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My value function assigns the following points: apple is 1, soap is 3, and egg is 4. My goal is to maximize my score, so I want the items that give me the highest points.\n\nIn my initial message, I proposed taking the egg and the soap, leaving the 3 apples for the other player. That would give me 4 (egg) + 3 (soap) = 7 points. The other player would get 3*1 = 3 points from the apples. However, since the other player has submitted their proposal first, I need to consider what they might have proposed.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n1. If the other player proposed taking the egg (value 4 for them), they might leave the soap and apples for me. But the soap is worth more to me than the apples, so I should aim to get the soap as well if possible. However, with only one soap, if they took it, I would only get the apples, which isn't ideal.\n\n2. If the other player proposed taking the soap (value 3 for them), they might have taken the egg as well, which would be bad for me, as I value the egg higher. Alternatively, they might take the apples and one other item.\n\nBut I don't know their exact proposal yet. Since I want to maximize my score, I should aim to secure the highest-value items for myself.\n\nI need to submit a proposal that complements theirs if possible, ensuring that our total doesn't exceed the available items. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points; otherwise, we both get zero.\n\nConsidering the items, if I take the egg and the soap, that leaves the 3 apples for the other player. My score would be 7, and theirs would be 3. That seems like a good split for me. But I need to make sure that this is complementary.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose taking the egg, which is worth 4 to me, and leave the rest to the other player, but the other player might have proposed taking the soap as well, which could cause overlap.\n\nI think the best move is to stick with my initial proposal, taking the egg and soap, ensuring that I get the highest possible value, and leave the apples for the other player. This way, if their proposal is complementary, both of us get our points. If not, we both get zero, but I have to try to make the best possible offer.\n\nI'll proceed with my proposal as [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap].\n"
