        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to maximize my score in this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the setup.<br/><br/>The items available are: 3 vases, 1 chair, and 1 wire. My secret values are vase: 2, chair: 3, wire: 1. The other player has their own secret values which I don&#x27;t know, so I need to think about possible strategies that could work regardless of their preferences.<br/><br/>Since each of us can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time, I need to decide whether to negotiate or just make a proposal. If I negotiate, I might get a better idea of what the other player wants, but if I propose too early, I risk them rejecting it or not matching, resulting in both of us getting zero points.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize my score, so ideally, I want the items that give me the highest value. The chair gives me the most value at 3, followed by vases at 2 each, and the wire at 1. So my priority is to get the chair if possible, then as many vases as I can, and the wire if nothing else.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t know what the other player&#x27;s values are, but they might be similar or different. If they also value the chair highly, there might be competition for it. Let&#x27;s think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I try to negotiate, maybe I can offer them some vases in exchange for the chair. For example, I could propose that I take the chair and wire, and they take the vases. That would give me 3 + 1 = 4 points. Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t want to give up the chair, maybe I can take two vases and the wire, leaving the chair and one vase for them. That would give me 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, which is better, but it depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I make a proposal right away, I should make sure it&#x27;s complementary, so their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s risky. If I propose [Proposal: 1 chair, 2 vases], leaving 1 vase and 1 wire for them, but if they also want the chair, this might not be complementary.<br/><br/>Another approach could be to offer to take the wire and some vases, leaving the chair for them. That way, if they value the chair more, they might accept. But I might be leaving value on the table.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should try to communicate first. Let me send a message asking what they want. But the instructions say that messages are sent directly, so I can ask them what they prefer. But since they might not want to reveal their true preferences, I can&#x27;t rely on their response. So maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be acceptable.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can think about the total value. The total points available are 3*2 (vases) + 3 (chair) + 1 (wire) = 6 + 3 +1 = 10. If I can get half, that&#x27;s 5, but ideally, I want more. So perhaps aiming for 6 or 7 points.<br/><br/>Let me think about what the other player might value. They might have a higher value for the chair, but maybe not. If I propose taking the chair and two vases, that&#x27;s 3 + 4 = 7 points. Then the other player would get 1 vase and the wire, which for me is 2 +1=3, but their values could be different. So if their total is higher with that, they might not accept. But if I take the chair, they might not get anything else of high value, so they might prefer to take the chair themselves.<br/><br/>This is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to take the chair and the wire, offering myself 4 points, and leaving the three vases for them. That&#x27;s 3 vases = 6 points for them. If their value for vases is high, they might accept. But if they value the chair more, they might not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could offer to take two vases and the wire (total 5), leaving the chair and one vase for them. That way, they get at least the chair if they value it, plus a vase, which could be more than their other options.<br/><br/>Wait, but without knowing their values, maybe I should just go for the maximum I can get without overlapping. If I take the chair and the wire, that&#x27;s 4 points, leaving three vases (6 points in my valuation, but maybe less for them). But if their valuation for the chair is higher, they might not accept my proposal.<br/><br/>Another thought: If I send a message asking them what they want most, but they might not be honest. Maybe I can suggest a split. For example, I can say, &quot;I&#x27;m interested in the chair. What do you prefer?&quot; But since they might not respond truthfully, I can&#x27;t rely on that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be acceptable. Let&#x27;s consider if I take the chair and one vase, giving me 5 points, and leave them with two vases and the wire. If their valuation for the chair isn&#x27;t that high, they might accept. If they do value the chair highly, they might reject and propose their own.<br/><br/>But if I make a proposal that includes the chair, and they also make a proposal that includes it, our proposals would conflict, and we both get zero. So I need to make sure that if I propose including the chair, they are likely to not include it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t take the chair, but perhaps offers a good deal for both. For example, I take two vases and the wire (5 points), and they take the chair and one vase. But then, if they value the chair highly, they would prefer that.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. Maybe the safest approach is to take the chair and wire, which gives me 4, and see. Alternatively, take two vases and the wire (5), which is better for me, and offer the chair to them. But again, if they don&#x27;t want the chair for some reason, they might not accept.<br/><br/>Wait, let me think about possible total points. If I take two vases (4) and the wire (1), that&#x27;s 5. If the other player takes the chair (3) and one vase (2), total is 5. So each gets 5, which is fair. But I don&#x27;t know their values. But if I can get 5, that&#x27;s not bad. So I can try to propose that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could try to take the chair and two vases, which is 7 points, leaving them with one vase and wire (3 points). But that&#x27;s a big gap, and they might not accept because they could get more by taking the chair themselves.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose the chair and two vases, that&#x27;s 3 + 4 =7 for me. If their value for the chair is higher than mine, say 4, and their vase is lower, then for them, my proposal would leave them with one vase (say 1) and wire (1), so 2 points, while they could get 4 (chair) + 2 (two vases) =6 if they propose that. So they would prefer to propose their own, but if I propose first, they have to accept or else we both get zero. So maybe that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I don&#x27;t take the chair, but take two vases and the wire, that&#x27;s 5. Let&#x27;s see: if I propose that, and they don&#x27;t also take the chair, then it&#x27;s fine. But if they do, we both lose.<br/><br/>I think the key is to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t require them to take something they might want more. So perhaps proposing I take two vases and the wire, and they take the chair and one vase. That way, if they value the chair more, they might accept. Alternatively, if I take the chair and wire, and they take the vases.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s try to model possible proposals. Let me think of possible complementary splits.<br/><br/>Option 1:<br/>Me: chair (3) + two vases (4) → total 7<br/>Them: one vase (2) + wire (1) → total 3 (assuming their vase is same as mine, but their wire could be higher.<br/><br/>But since their values are secret, I don&#x27;t know. So if I propose this, they might not accept because they could get more by taking the chair themselves.<br/><br/>Option 2:<br/>Me: two vases (4) + wire (1) → total 5<br/>Them: chair (3) + one vase (2) → total 5<br/><br/>This seems fair. If their values are similar, they might accept because it&#x27;s a 50-50 split.<br/><br/>Option 3:<br/>Me: chair (3) + wire (1) → total 4<br/>Them: three vases (6) → total 6<br/><br/>This gives me 4, them 6, which is less for me, but maybe they accept because they get more.<br/><br/>Option 4:<br/>Me: chair (3) + one vase (2) → total 5<br/>Them: two vases (4) + wire (1) → total 5<br/><br/>Same as option 2, just swapping who gets what.<br/><br/>I think option 2 or 4 is better because it&#x27;s a balanced split. So I can try to make a proposal that takes two vases and the wire, leaving them with chair and one vase. If their values are similar, this is fair, but if they value the chair more than vases, they might not accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can try to send a message to the other player suggesting a split. For example, &quot;I propose we split the items as follows: I take two vases and the wire, and you take the chair and one vase. Let me know if this works for you.&quot;<br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages or make a proposal, I have to decide whether to negotiate or make a proposal. If I send a message asking, and they agree, great. If not, maybe we both get zero.<br/><br/>But to ensure I get some points, maybe it&#x27;s better to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely complementary. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know until it&#x27;s too late.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should just make a proposal that I take the chair and the wire, and see if that&#x27;s acceptable. If the other player doesn&#x27;t also take the chair, it works. Otherwise, we both get zero.<br/><br/>But I think making a balanced proposal is better. Let me try to think about their possible preferences. If they have a higher value for the chair, they might not want to give it up. So perhaps I can let them have the chair if they give me the majority of the vases.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their values, so it&#x27;s a gamble. I think the safest approach is to propose a balanced split, such as two vases and the wire for me, and the chair and one vase for them. That way, if their values are similar, they might accept, and if not, I might have to try again.<br/><br/>But since I can only make one proposal, I have to get it right. Alternatively, I can send a message to the other player suggesting this split and see if they agree before making a proposal. But again, they might not reply or might not accept.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go with making a proposal that I take two vases and the wire, and they take the chair and one vase. That way, it&#x27;s a 5-5 split in my valuation. Hopefully, it&#x27;s complementary.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out what proposal to make in this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the situation.<br/><br/>First, the available items are 3 vases, 1 chair, and 1 wire. My secret value function assigns 0 points to vases, 8 points for the chair, and 2 points for the wire. The other player has already submitted a proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn to respond.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s value function, but I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap so we can both get points. If our proposals are complementary (meaning we don&#x27;t both want the same items beyond the available quantity), we each get the sum of our values for the items we get. Otherwise, we both get zero. So, my goal is to maximize my score.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s think about possible items each of us might want. I value the chair the most at 8 points, and the wire at 2. I don&#x27;t care about the vases. The other player&#x27;s preferences are unknown, but they might value the vases or the other items differently.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make an educated guess based on the available items. The other player could have taken the chair, the wire, or some vases, or a combination. If they took the chair, I might have to settle for the wire and maybe some vases, but since vases are worth nothing to me, I’d prefer just the wire.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player didn&#x27;t take the chair, I could take it along with the wire for a total of 10 points. But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>Given that there are 3 vases, the other player might have taken some of them, but I don&#x27;t value them. So, to maximize my score, I should aim for the chair and the wire. Let me check: if I take the chair and the wire, that&#x27;s 8 + 2 = 10 points for me. But what if the other player also took one of them?<br/><br/>If they took the chair, I can&#x27;t get it, so I should take the wire. If they took the wire, I can take the chair. If they took both, then we might not have a complementary proposal, but that&#x27;s unlikely because each of us can only take what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is already submitted. So I need to see if my proposal can complement theirs. Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Scenario 1: The other player took the chair. Then I should take the wire. That way, my proposal is [1 wire], and their proposal is [1 chair], which is complementary.<br/><br/>Scenario 2: The other player took the wire. Then I should take the chair, so my proposal is [1 chair], which is complementary with their [1 wire].<br/><br/>Scenario 3: The other player took vases only. Then I can take both the chair and the wire for 10 points.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know what they took, I have to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict. The safest approach is to take the highest value items I can without overlapping, which are the chair and the wire.<br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll propose [1 chair, 1 wire]. If the other player hasn&#x27;t taken either, great, I get 10. If they took one, the other one is still available. But wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal could have taken one, so I might not be able to get both.<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe I should prioritize the chair, as it&#x27;s worth more. So if I propose just the chair, and the other player hasn&#x27;t taken it, I get 8, which is good. If they have taken it, then I can take the wire.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take just the wire, but that&#x27;s only 2 points, which is worse for me. So perhaps I should go for the chair and hope the other player didn&#x27;t take it.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose both the chair and the wire, and the other player took one, then as long as they didn&#x27;t take both, it might still work. Let me think about the numbers.<br/><br/>There&#x27;s 1 chair, 1 wire, and 3 vases. If the other player took 1 chair, I can take the wire. If they took the wire, I take the chair. If they took neither, I can take both. If they took both, which is possible only if they have 2 items, but the quantities are 1 each, so they can&#x27;t take both chair and wire as that&#x27;s two items, but given there are 1 each, it&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>Wait, the proposals are in the format [number, object], so the other player might have taken, for example, 2 vases and 1 chair, or 3 vases, etc.<br/><br/>Alternatively, they might have taken the chair and the wire, but that would be 2 items, while I can also take 2. Wait, the total items available are 5 (3 vases, 1 chair, 1 wire). If I take 2 items (chair and wire), and the other player takes 3 items (all vases), that&#x27;s possible. So maybe I should just go for chair and wire.<br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player has already proposed taking the chair or the wire, then my proposal would overlap. Since their proposal is already submitted, I can&#x27;t know, but I have to make a proposal that, when combined, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available quantities.<br/><br/>Wait, actually, the system only checks if the combined proposals are complementary. So if I propose chair and wire, and the other player has proposed, say, 2 vases, then it&#x27;s okay because 1 chair + 1 wire + 2 vases = 5 items, which is exactly the total. If the other player took the chair, then my proposal would want the chair again, so it&#x27;s not complementary, so both get zero.<br/><br/>Therefore, the best approach is to propose the items that I value most, assuming the other player didn&#x27;t take them. Since I can&#x27;t communicate, I have to choose the best possible.<br/><br/>So I think I&#x27;ll propose the chair and the wire. If the other player took one of them, I might still get the other. If they took both, we both get zero, but that seems less likely because the other player might not value both as much as I do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should split the items. Since I don&#x27;t value vases, I can let the other player take all the vases, and I take the chair and wire. So I&#x27;ll propose [1 chair, 1 wire].<br/></p>
