You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 pot, 1 candy, 1 whistle, 2 dice\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\npot: 2, candy: 3, whistle: 3, dice: 1\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n"

            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing this negotiation game where I have to divide a set of items with another player. The goal is to maximize my score based on my secret value function. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me list out the available items and their quantities:\n- 1 pot\n- 1 candy\n- 1 whistle\n- 2 dice\n\nMy secret values are:\n- pot: 2\n- candy: 3\n- whistle: 3\n- dice: 1\n\nThe other player's values are unknown, but I'll need to negotiate to get the best possible outcome for myself.\n\nGiven that we can each send up to 5 messages, I should start by trying to communicate my preferences or perhaps propose a split that benefits me the most without being too greedy. Since the goal is to have complementary proposals, it's crucial to find a division where both of us get items we value highly enough so that we don't end up with zero points.\n\nLet me consider the total value of each item to me:\nCandy and whistle are both valued at 3 each, which are my highest. The pot is 2, and each die is 1. So, my priority should be to secure the candy and whistle if possible. However, I also have two dice, which might be valuable to the other player.\n\nBut wait, the maximum number of each item is limited. Only one pot, one candy, one whistle, and two dice. So, the other player might be interested in the dice because there are two, but each is only worth 1 to me. Maybe I can offer one die and keep one, but that might not be the best strategy.\n\nPerhaps I should try to propose a split where I get the candy and whistle, and let the other player have the pot and both dice. Let me calculate my score in that case: candy (3) + whistle (3) = 6. The other player would get pot (2) + 2 dice (1 each) = 4. That could be acceptable, but the other player might not agree if they value the candy or whistle more than I think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the pot more than I do. Since the pot is only worth 2 to me, if they have a higher value for it, they might be willing to give up other items. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to try to maximize the total value for both of us. If I take the candy and whistle (total 6) and they take the pot and both dice (total 2+2=4), the total is 10. If I tried to take the candy, pot, and both dice, that would be 3+2+1+1=7, leaving them with only the whistle (3). But that's a total of 10 as well. However, since we can only each make a proposal, if I take too much, the other player might not agree, resulting in both of us getting zero.\n\nMaybe a fairer split would be better. If I take candy and whistle (6) and they take pot and both dice (4), that's a total of 10. Alternatively, if I take candy (3) and two dice (2), and they take whistle (3) and pot (2), that's also a total of 5 each, but total is 10 as well. Wait, that can't be because 3+2=5 for me and 3+2=5 for them. Hmm, maybe that's a balanced approach.\n\nBut wait, the total value from my side is 10, but the split can vary. If I take candy and whistle, that's 6 for me, which is better than taking just 5. But I have to check if that's feasible.\n\nWait, each die is only worth 1 to me, so getting two dice is only 2. If I take the candy and whistle, that's 6, which is better than taking candy, pot, and two dice, which would be 7, but the other player might not accept because they'd only get the whistle worth 3, which might be too low for them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start by offering a proposal that I'm willing to take the candy and whistle, and give them the pot and both dice. That way, I get 6 points, and they get 4. Let me check if that's a complementary proposal. There's 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 whistle, and 2 dice. So, me taking candy and whistle, and them taking pot and two dice would work because the numbers add up correctly.\n\nSo I can send a message suggesting that split. If they accept, great. If not, I might have to negotiate further. But since we can send up to 5 messages, I can try to persuade them or adjust my proposal based on their responses.\n\nBut since it's the first message, maybe I should start by stating my interest in the higher-value items but also be open to negotiation. I don't want to seem too greedy right away, or they might refuse and try to wait for me to make a better offer.\n\nWait, but if I make a secret proposal right away, that might be my only chance. Alternatively, I can negotiate through messages to see if we can reach an agreement before making the proposal.\n\nLet me consider sending a message first. I can say something like, \"I value the candy and whistle the most. I'm willing to take those if you take the pot and the dice. What do you think?\"\n\nThis way, I'm expressing my preferences and making a concrete offer. They can respond by agreeing, rejecting, or counter-offering. Then I can adjust based on their response.\n\nIf they agree, we both get our preferred items without conflict. If they don't, I can adjust. For example, if they want the candy, maybe I can offer them the candy and take the whistle and something else. Or if they value the dice more, I can keep one die and give them the other.\n\nAlternatively, since there are two dice, maybe I can offer one die and keep one. But since dice are low-value to me, offering both might be better to get a higher-value item for myself.\n\nWait, but if I offer both dice, I can keep the higher-value items. So maybe it's better to offer them both dice and take candy and whistle.\n\nAnother consideration: if the other player values the pot or dice more than I do, they might prefer that. So, perhaps I can structure my proposal to give them the pot and dice in exchange for the candy and whistle.\n\nI think it's best to make a first message expressing my offer clearly. So I'll let them know I'm interested in the candy and whistle and willing to let them have the pot and dice. Let's see how they respond.\n"
