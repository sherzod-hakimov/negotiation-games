        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to divide these items between me and the other player. Let me start by restating the problem to make sure I understand it correctly.<br/><br/>We have a set of items: 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, and 1 eraser. Each of us has a secret value function. My values are bowl: 5, bottle: 5, fruit: 0, eraser: 0. The other player has some secret values that I don&#x27;t know. Our goal is to negotiate via messages, up to 5 each, to agree on a division. If our secret proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlap in the items we each take and together they don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities), then we each get the sum of the values of the items we receive. Otherwise, we both get zero.<br/><br/>My aim is to maximize my score. So I need to figure out a way to propose a division that the other player will accept, without knowing their exact values. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.<br/><br/>First, let me consider my own preferences. I value the bowl and bottle highly, each worth 5 points. Fruits and eraser are worthless to me (0 points). So ideally, I would like to get both the bowl and the bottle. However, the other player might also value these items, so I might have to negotiate.<br/><br/>Since there&#x27;s only one bowl and one bottle, and 2 fruits and 1 eraser, I can think about possible divisions. The total items are 5, but the key ones are bowl, bottle, and the rest are fruits + eraser.<br/><br/>I wonder if the other player also values the bowl and bottle, or maybe they don&#x27;t. If they value fruits or eraser, it&#x27;s in my interest to keep the high-value items for myself. But without knowing, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>One approach could be to propose taking both the bowl and bottle for myself and leave the rest for the other player. But that might be too greedy, and the other player might not accept it, leading us both to get zero. Alternatively, I could offer a split where I take one high-value item and leave the other, but that might not be optimal for me.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, maybe they have a different preference. Let me think about possible strategies.<br/><br/>I could start by making a proposal in the first message, but since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I should try to negotiate first. For example, I could ask the other player what they want or suggest a split.<br/><br/>But since the messages are direct, the other player might not reveal their true preferences. So maybe it&#x27;s better to make an initial offer that&#x27;s as good as possible for me while still being acceptable to them.<br/><br/>Another thought: since I only care about bowl and bottle, maybe I can offer to give up the eraser and one fruit, and keep the rest. But wait, the other items are the bowl, bottle, and the rest are low value. Wait, no, the set is bowl, bottle, 2 fruits, and eraser. So the total is 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, 1 eraser.<br/><br/>If I take bowl and bottle, that&#x27;s 2 items, and the other player gets 2 fruits and 1 eraser. But perhaps the other player also values bowl and bottle. Alternatively, maybe they don&#x27;t.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should maximize my own value while leaving enough for the other player so that they prefer accepting over rejecting.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. So perhaps the safest approach is to take the two high-value items for myself and offer the rest to the other player. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary (i.e., they take the fruits and eraser), then we both get our points.<br/><br/>But if the other player also wants bowl or bottle, then our proposals might clash, and we both get zero. So I need to balance between being greedy and being accommodating.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can offer to let them have one of the high-value items in exchange for the other. For example, I take bowl, they take bottle, and then the rest go to one of us. Or vice versa.<br/><br/>Wait, but I value both equally, so it doesn&#x27;t matter which one I take. So maybe I can propose that I take one, and they take the other, and we split the rest. However, since the rest are low value, but perhaps the other player values them.<br/><br/>Hmm, another thought: since I value bowl and bottle equally, but fruits and eraser are worthless to me, perhaps I can try to offer a proposal that gives me both high-value items, and see if the other player is willing to accept the rest. If not, we might have to split the high-value items.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can send a message suggesting a split. For example, I could say, &quot;I propose that I take the bowl, and you take the bottle, and we split the fruits and eraser however.&quot; But wait, the fruits are 2, and eraser is 1.<br/><br/>Wait, but the eraser is only one, so maybe I can offer to take bowl and eraser, and they take bottle and fruits. But that&#x27;s not better for me since eraser is 0 value.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can just take bowl and bottle, and let them have the rest. That way, I get 10 points, and they get whatever they value from the fruits and eraser.<br/><br/>But if the other player also wants bowl or bottle, then our proposals would conflict, leading to zero for both. So maybe I should instead try to offer a compromise where I get one high-value item, and they get the other, plus some low-value items.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know what they value. Perhaps they place higher value on the bowl, or the bottle, or maybe they don&#x27;t care about either and value the fruits or eraser.<br/><br/>Wait, given that the other player&#x27;s values are secret, perhaps the optimal strategy is to maximize the minimum possible outcome. So, if I propose taking both bowl and bottle, the worst case is that they also want both, leading to zero. But perhaps the best case is that they don&#x27;t, and we both get our scores.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take one high-value item, and they take the other, we can both get some points. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal could be anything, it&#x27;s a bit risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can make a proposal that&#x27;s more generous, giving them one high-value item and taking the other, thus ensuring that their best response is to accept, because they get some value, rather than risk getting nothing.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should offer to take bowl, and let them take bottle, and then the rest can be split. Or vice versa.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal could be anything. If I offer bowl, they might accept by proposing bottle, or they might also try to take bowl, leading to both of us getting zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose a specific split, like I take bowl and eraser, and they take bottle and fruits. Or bowl and one fruit, and they take the rest.<br/><br/>But it&#x27;s complicated, and since I can only send messages, not knowing their response, perhaps the best approach is to make a proposal in the first message.<br/><br/>Wait, but the initial messages are negotiation, and the secret proposal is the final step. So perhaps I should first try to communicate with the other player to find a mutually acceptable split.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps I can suggest a split and see how they respond.<br/><br/>For example, I could start by saying, &quot;I propose that I take bowl and bottle, and you take the fruits and eraser.&quot; Then, depending on their response, we can adjust.<br/><br/>But they might not accept, especially if they also want bowl or bottle. Alternatively, maybe I should offer a split where I take one high-value item and they take the other.<br/><br/>So, I could say, &quot;How about I take the bowl, and you take the bottle? Then we can split the rest.&quot; But I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re interested in that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, they might prefer the other way around, taking bowl and leaving bottle for me.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. So perhaps the best approach is to make a proposal that gives me both high-value items and see if the other player accepts. If they don&#x27;t, then we can try to adjust in subsequent messages.<br/><br/>Wait, but the negotiation is up to 5 messages, and then we submit secret proposals. So perhaps I can make an initial offer, and if they respond with a counter-offer, we can negotiate.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since the system allows me to send a secret proposal at any time, I can wait to see their responses before deciding.<br/><br/>But in this scenario, since I don&#x27;t have the other player&#x27;s responses, I need to make the best possible initial proposal that maximizes my score while being acceptable to the other player.<br/><br/>So, considering all this, I think the optimal strategy is to propose taking both the bowl and the bottle. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, taking the remaining items, then we both get our points. If they also want bowl or bottle, then we both get zero. But given that I can only get 10 points if I take both, it&#x27;s worth the risk because if the other player doesn&#x27;t value them, I get the maximum. If they do, then no gain, but also no loss beyond zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can offer to take one high-value item and give the other to them, ensuring that we both get something. But since I can only send one proposal, I have to decide.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the process is that we exchange up to 5 messages, then each submits a secret proposal. So the messages are part of the negotiation, and the secret proposals are the final step.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should use the messages to communicate and agree on a split, then both submit proposals based on that. But since the proposals are secret, there&#x27;s a risk of both trying to take more.<br/><br/>But if we can reach an agreement through messages, we can each submit our part. For example, if I suggest taking bowl, and the other player agrees, then we can each submit proposals accordingly.<br/><br/>However, since the other player might not respond honestly, it&#x27;s possible they could agree in messages but then submit a different proposal. But the system is designed such that if the proposals are complementary, they are accepted; otherwise, both get zero. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to try to negotiate an agreement via messages and then submit complementary proposals.<br/><br/>Given that, I can start by sending a message suggesting a split.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible splits:<br/><br/>Option 1: I take bowl and bottle, they take fruits and eraser.<br/><br/>Option 2: I take bowl, they take bottle, and we split the fruits and eraser (they take both, perhaps).<br/><br/>Option 3: I take bottle, they take bowl, and same as above.<br/><br/>Option 4: I take bowl and eraser, they take bottle and fruits.<br/><br/>But since eraser is 0 value to me, it&#x27;s better to have them take it.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best split is me taking bowl and bottle, and them taking fruits and eraser.<br/><br/>But again, if they also value bowl and bottle, they might not accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps they value the fruits and eraser more.<br/><br/>Wait, considering that the total number of items is 5, but the only high-value ones are bowl and bottle for me. If the other player has higher value for fruits or eraser, they might prefer taking those.<br/><br/>So maybe I should offer to take bowl and bottle, and let them have the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to ensure a complementary proposal, I can offer a split where I take bowl and eraser, and they take bottle and the two fruits. But eraser is 0 value to me, so that&#x27;s not great.<br/><br/>Wait, but perhaps I should think about the possible value distributions. Let&#x27;s consider that the other player&#x27;s values could be anything. The best strategy might be to maximize my minimum gain.<br/><br/>So if I propose to take bowl and bottle, the worst case is that the other player also wants both, and we both get zero. The best case is that they don&#x27;t, and I get 10 points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take one, say bowl, and offer them the rest, then if they take bottle and the rest, we both get some points. But I only get 5, which is less than 10.<br/><br/>But perhaps it&#x27;s better to aim for 5 points guaranteed rather than 10 with a risk of 0.<br/><br/>But wait, since the other player&#x27;s values are unknown, the risk is there either way. If I propose taking bowl and bottle, and they also value them, we get 0. If they don&#x27;t, I get 10. On the other hand, if I propose taking one, I can get 5, but they might not agree and try to take both themselves.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can send a message suggesting a split, and if they don&#x27;t respond, I can make a proposal. But since I need to make a decision now, perhaps I should go with taking both high-value items.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the best approach is to send a message to the other player proposing a split. Let&#x27;s say I offer to take bowl and bottle, and they can have the rest. I can phrase it as: &quot;I propose I take bowl and bottle, you take the fruits and eraser.&quot;<br/><br/>Then, if they accept, we both get our points. If they don&#x27;t, we might have to negotiate further.<br/><br/>But since the system allows up to 5 messages, perhaps after the first message, I can adjust based on their response.<br/><br/>But in this scenario, I don&#x27;t have their responses, so I have to make the best initial proposal.<br/><br/>Given that, I think I should submit a proposal taking bowl and bottle, as that gives me the highest possible score if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll make the secret proposal as [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle].<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I&#x27;m playing this negotiation game where I have to divide a set of items between me and another player. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, and 1 eraser. My secret values are bowl:1, bottle:0, fruit:3, eraser:3. So fruits and eraser are my top priorities because they give me the highest points.<br/><br/>The other player has already submitted their proposal, but I don&#x27;t know what it is. I need to make sure that my proposal is complementary to theirs so that we both get points. If our proposals don&#x27;t cover all the items or overlap, we both get zero. So I need to figure out a way to maximize my score while making sure that the total taken doesn&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>Since I really value fruits and eraser, I should aim to get as many of those as possible. But I have to consider what the other player might have chosen. Let me think about possible combinations.<br/><br/>First, I know there&#x27;s 1 bowl and 1 bottle, which I don&#x27;t care much about. My value for them is low, so maybe the other player might want them. If I take the bowl and bottle, that&#x27;s only 1 and 0 points, but maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t want them, so I can let them have the rest. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the high-value items.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might also want the fruits and eraser. So if they took both, I might end up with nothing. I need to make a proposal that either takes the high-value items or the low ones, depending on what they took.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I should try to cover the high-value items. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s the maximum I can take without exceeding the available items. There are 2 fruits, so I can take both. The eraser is one, so I can take that. The bowl and bottle are one each, but I don&#x27;t value them much.<br/><br/>If I take both fruits and the eraser, that&#x27;s 3 + 3 = 6 points. Plus, if I take the bowl, that&#x27;s 1, making it 7. But wait, if the other player took the bottle, then that&#x27;s fine because I don&#x27;t value it. Alternatively, maybe I should also take the bottle to maximize, but I don&#x27;t care about it.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player took the bowl or the bottle. So if I take both fruits and the eraser, and maybe the bowl, then the other player might have taken the bottle. But that depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take both fruits and the eraser, that&#x27;s 2 items, leaving the bowl and bottle. If the other player took one of those, our proposals would be complementary. But if I take all four items, that&#x27;s not possible because I can only take up to the available quantities.<br/><br/>Wait, no, each proposal is a subset of the available items. So if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes, say, the bowl and bottle, and I include fruits and eraser, that&#x27;s complementary. So I can safely take the fruits and eraser.<br/><br/>But I should also check if I can take more. The total items are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, 1 eraser. If I take 2 fruits and eraser, that&#x27;s 3 items, leaving bowl and bottle, which the other player can take. So my proposal would be 2 fruits and 1 eraser. That gives me 3+3=6 points. But if I can also take the bowl or bottle, that&#x27;s an extra 1 point, but maybe it&#x27;s not necessary because the other player might have taken one.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take 2 fruits, eraser, and bowl. That would be 3+3+1=7 points, leaving the bottle for the other player. That could work if their proposal includes the bottle.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their proposal, so I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap. So perhaps I should take the high-value items and let them take the low ones.<br/><br/>So my proposal should be 2 fruits and 1 eraser. Let me check: that&#x27;s within the available quantities, and leaves the bowl and bottle for the other player. If their proposal includes, say, the bowl, then that works. Or if they took the bottle, also works.<br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s the best approach because it maximizes my score while allowing the other player to have something without overlapping. So I&#x27;ll make my proposal [Proposal: 2 fruit, 1 eraser].<br/></p>
