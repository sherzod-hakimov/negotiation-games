        <p>Alright, I need to figure out how to divide the items with the other player to maximize my score. Let me start by understanding the setup.<br/><br/>The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My value function is shovel: 0, picture: 0, shell: 10. So I only value the shell, which is worth 10 points to me. The other player&#x27;s value function is secret, but I don&#x27;t know it. <br/><br/>Since I value only the shell, my goal is to get that shell while allowing the other player to take the other items, which are worthless to me. But since the other player doesn&#x27;t know my values, they might be thinking similarly or differently.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible scenarios. The other player could value shovels, pictures, the shell, or a mix. Since I don&#x27;t know, I need a strategy that ensures I get the shell if possible.<br/><br/>If I propose to take the shell, the other player might accept because they might not value it as much. But they might also want it. Alternatively, I could ask them about their preferences to gauge what they want.<br/><br/>So maybe I can send a message asking what they want. Let&#x27;s try that.<br/><br/>&quot;Hi, what items are you interested in taking?&quot;<br/><br/>Depending on their response, I can adjust. If they don&#x27;t want the shell, I can take it. If they do, maybe I need to negotiate.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can only send 5 messages or make a proposal. Also, the secret proposal can be made at any time. So perhaps I should try to figure out if the other player wants the shell or not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since I value only the shell, I could just propose taking the shell and let them have the rest. Let me consider that.<br/><br/>But if I do that, the other player might accept, but if they also want the shell, my proposal would conflict, and both would get zero. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to test the waters first.<br/><br/>So Message 1: Ask the other player what they&#x27;re interested in.<br/><br/>If they reply they don&#x27;t care about the shell, I can take it. If they do, I might have to negotiate or risk a proposal conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, another approach: since the shell is the only item with value to me, perhaps I can offer to let them have all the other items if I can take the shell. But I don&#x27;t know if they value the shell, so maybe they&#x27;ll accept.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I can propose giving them all the shovels and pictures in exchange for the shell. But I don&#x27;t know what they value. They might not care about the shovels and pictures.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the other player could be in a similar situation, valuing only one item. Maybe they also value the shell, or maybe shovels or pictures.<br/><br/>I think the safest approach is to try to negotiate first. Let me send a message asking what they need or want.<br/><br/>Message 1: &quot;What items are you interested in taking?&quot;<br/><br/>If they respond that they don&#x27;t want the shell, I can propose taking it. If they do, I might have to decide whether to risk a conflict or accept some other division.<br/><br/>Wait, but if both of us want the shell, and our proposals include it, we both get zero. So it&#x27;s better to avoid that. Maybe I can suggest that they take the other items and I take the shell.<br/><br/>So perhaps in Message 1, I can say: &quot;I&#x27;m interested in the shell. Would you be okay if I take it while you take the rest?&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, then we can each propose our shares. If not, I have to think of another approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they don&#x27;t value the shell, so my initial proposal could just be to take the shell and let them have the rest.<br/><br/>But to reduce the chance of conflict, it&#x27;s better to communicate.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll send a message expressing my interest in the shell and see how they respond.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, the other player wants the shell. But looking at the set, there&#x27;s only one shell, so if they take it, I can&#x27;t have it. My value for the shell is really high—5 points. The other items, shovels and pictures, are each worth 1 point. I have to maximize my score.<br/><br/>So, if the other player takes the shell, I&#x27;ll have to divide the remaining items. There are 3 shovs and 2 pictures left. I can take some combination, but each is only worth 1 point, so getting multiple won&#x27;t help much. If I give in and let them have the shell, I might get 3 shovels and 2 pictures, totaling 5 points. But if I keep the shell, I get 5 points plus maybe some extra from the other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values the shell less than I do. If I can take the shell and maybe one shovel or picture, that would be 6 points, which is better than letting them have it. But I need to see how they respond. Since my last message didn&#x27;t get a clear response, I should make a proposal offering to give them the shovels and pictures if I can take the shell.<br/><br/>Let me propose: I take the shell and leave them the rest. So my proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 shell]&quot;. I think this is a good move because it&#x27;s clear and gives them what they might want, potentially leading to a complementary agreement.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>I think taking the shell is crucial because it offers the highest value. I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal to take it while offering the other items to the opponent.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 shell]</p>

    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I have to divide items with another player. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My secret value function gives me 0 points for shovels and pictures, but a whopping 10 points for the shell. That means my goal is to get the shell because it’s the only thing that gives me any value.<br/><br/>In the chat, I messaged the other player first, expressing interest in the shell and asking if they&#x27;d be okay with me taking it while they take the other items. I thought that was a friendly approach, trying to see if we could come to an easy agreement without conflict. Maybe they would agree since the shell is the only high-value item for me.<br/><br/>But then, they made a secret proposal before responding. Now it&#x27;s my turn to do the same. I guess they didn&#x27;t want to negotiate openly, which is a bit surprising because I thought proposing first might be seen as taking initiative. But maybe they have their own reasons.<br/><br/>I need to decide what to include in my proposal. Since the shell is my only valuable item, I should definitely include that. But there are other items—3 shovels and 2 pictures. Since shovels and pictures don&#x27;t add any value for me, what should I do with them? I don&#x27;t want to take items that don&#x27;t benefit me, but if I include some, maybe they won&#x27;t mind.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they took. If I take the shell and maybe some other items, will that clash with their proposal? If both our proposals are complementary, meaning they don&#x27;t overlap, we both get points; otherwise, we both get zero. Since the shell is unique, if both of us want it, we both get zero. But I can’t risk that. I have to make sure that I get the shell, and maybe offer them the rest.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their values. They might value the other items highly, or maybe they also value the shell. If they didn&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t have made a proposal so quickly. Maybe they’re trying to snag the shell before I do.<br/><br/>So, if I only take the shell in my proposal, and they take the rest, that might work. But if they also took the shell, then our proposals aren&#x27;t complementary, and I get nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take the shell and maybe one shovel or picture, but it&#x27;s not worth it for me. I should just go for the shell. Since there&#x27;s only one, if I take it, they can&#x27;t. So, taking just the shell in my proposal seems like the safest bet. Hopefully, their proposal didn&#x27;t include the shell. If it did, we both lose, but maybe I can risk it.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe they didn&#x27;t take the shell because they thought I would and tried to get the other items. Or maybe they took the shell, thinking they could secure it. Without knowing, I have to make the best move. I should go for the shell to maximize my points.<br/></p>
