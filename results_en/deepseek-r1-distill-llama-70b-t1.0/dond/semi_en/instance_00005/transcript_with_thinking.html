        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I have to divide four items with another player. The items are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, and 1 battery. My value function is: dice are worth 1 each, the ball is worth 7, glue is 0, and the battery is 1. The goal is to maximize my score, which is the sum of the values of the items I get. If both me and the other player submit complementary proposals, we each get points based on our items&#x27; values. If not, we both get zero. <br/><br/>First, I need to strategize how to approach the negotiation. I know the items and their quantities, but I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s value function. Since the ball is the most valuable to me (worth 7) and the glue is worth nothing, I should probably try to secure the ball. The dice and battery are each worth 1, so they&#x27;re less critical but still contributes to the score.<br/><br/>I also have to consider that the other player might have different preferences. Maybe the other player values the dice more, or perhaps they also want the ball. Since the ball is only one, getting it would be a big win for me. The glue, since it&#x27;s worth nothing to me, I might be willing to give it away if needed.<br/><br/>I can send up to five messages or make a proposal at any time. I should start by trying to communicate my needs without revealing too much. Perhaps I can hint at what I&#x27;m willing to offer. Let me try to find a balance between being cooperative and strategic.<br/><br/>Maybe I can start by asking the other player what they value most. If I can get them to reveal their preferences, I can make a better offer. For example, if they say they want the dice, I can offer them one die in exchange for the ball. But since messages are transmitted directly, I need to be careful not to reveal my own value function.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could propose an offer directly, but that might limit my flexibility. Since making a proposal ends the negotiation, I might want to hold off until I have a better idea of what the other player is willing to accept.<br/><br/>Let me think through possible negotiations:<br/><br/>1. I message: &quot;What are you most interested in?&quot;<br/>   - If they respond with dice, I can offer 1 die in exchange for the ball.<br/>   - If they respond with the ball, I might have to negotiate a trade, but since the ball is more valuable to me, I might prefer to keep it.<br/>   - If they respond with the glue, which is worthless to me, I can offer that easily.<br/>   - The battery is less likely since it&#x27;s only worth 1, but still better than nothing.<br/><br/>2. Maybe I can first ask how much they value the ball. But that might be too direct and they might not be honest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make an initial offer, like &quot;I want the ball and the battery. What do you want?&quot; That way, I&#x27;m asserting what I want, but they might not agree and make a counteroffer.<br/><br/>Another approach: Since I have two dice, I can offer one die to the other player in exchange for something else. But since the dice are each worth only 1, I might not want to give up both.<br/><br/>Wait, there are two dice. So maybe offering one die to get the ball might be a good trade, considering the ball is worth 7 to me. So if I give up one die (1 point) to get the ball (7 points), that would be a net gain of 6, which is great. But the other player might also value the ball highly, so they might not agree. Alternatively, the other player might not be interested in the dice and just take the ball.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player doesn&#x27;t value the ball as much, they might accept giving it to me in exchange for something else.<br/><br/>I should also remember that if we cannot reach a complementary proposal, both get zero. So it&#x27;s better to aim for a proposal where both can get their items without overlap.<br/><br/>Given that, perhaps I should prioritize securing the ball first. Let me try to message the other player to see if they&#x27;re willing to trade.<br/><br/>I can send a message like: &quot;I&#x27;m interested in the ball. What do you need?&quot;<br/><br/>If they respond that they also want the ball, I might have to consider alternative strategies, perhaps offering them the glue in exchange, but that&#x27;s not much. Alternatively, I could offer them a die and the battery in exchange for the ball. Since the ball is worth 7 to me, giving up 2 (from a die and battery) would still net me 5, which is better than nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t want the ball, I can take it and see what else I can get. But I need to be cautious.<br/><br/>Another thought: If I can get the ball and one die, that would give me 8 points (7+1). The other player would get the remaining die, glue, and battery (1+0+1=2). Alternatively, if I take the ball and the battery, that&#x27;s 8 points, and the other gets the dice and glue (1+1+0=2).<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player&#x27;s value function is different. Maybe they value the battery more, or the glue. I just don&#x27;t know. So I need to find a way to maximize my minimum gain.<br/><br/>Let me consider possible proposals they might make. For example, they might propose taking two dice, leaving me with the ball, glue, and battery. But that would give me 7+0+1=8, which is good for me. Alternatively, they might take the ball and something else, which would be bad for me.<br/><br/>If I can, I should try to propose first. Maybe I can make a proposal that gives me the ball and something else, but the other player can still get their share without overlapping.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to take the ball and battery, leaving the two dice and glue for the other player. That way, I get 7+1=8, and the other gets 1+1+0=2, but if they have a different value function, maybe they prefer that. Alternatively, if I take the ball and one die, I get 7+1=8, and the other can have the remaining die, glue, and battery, which is 1+0+1=2. Either way, I get 8, which is the maximum possible for me.<br/><br/>But wait, if I can get the ball and the battery, that&#x27;s 8. Alternatively, the ball and one die, also 8. The difference is what the other player gets, but since their score doesn&#x27;t affect mine beyond the need for the proposals to be complementary, I just need to ensure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should make a proposal that takes the ball and the battery. That way, I get 8 points, and the other player can have the two dice and glue, which they might be satisfied with, especially if they value the dice more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can try to negotiate for the ball and a die and give them the rest. But then I&#x27;d get 8, they get 1+0+1=2. Either way, it&#x27;s the same for me.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the ball and the battery, the other player gets the two dice and glue, which sum to 2, while I get 8. That&#x27;s a big difference, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player has a value function where the dice and battery are worth more, maybe I can make a better deal. For example, if they value the battery highly, I could offer them the battery in exchange for the ball.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, I have to assume the worst. So I should aim to secure the ball and whatever else I can get without conflicting.<br/><br/>Another angle: since I have to make complementary proposals, perhaps I can offer to take the ball and one die, and let them have the other. But the glue is worth nothing, so they might want to take that as well. So if I take ball and die (8), they take the other die, glue, and battery (1+0+1=2). That&#x27;s acceptable because it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take ball and battery (8), they take two dice and glue (2). So I&#x27;m getting the same score either way.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can get both the ball and both dice, but that would leave nothing for the other player except glue, which is 0. But then their proposal would have to be complementary, which it can&#x27;t be if I take all the valuable items. So that&#x27;s not feasible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, you get the points. So I can only take items that don&#x27;t overlap with theirs. So if I propose to take two dice, ball, and battery, that leaves the glue for them. So they can propose to take the glue, which is complementary. In that case, I would get 1+1+7+1=10, and they get 0. That seems optimal for me, but is that allowed? Because the other player would have to also propose to take the glue, but the glue is worth nothing. If they propose to take nothing, then the proposals aren&#x27;t complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, no. The other player must also submit a proposal that together cover exactly all items. So if I take ball, dice, and battery, the other player must take the glue. If they do, then it&#x27;s complementary. So I can get 10, they get 0. But if they don&#x27;t propose the glue, but instead propose something else, then our proposals would conflict, and both get 0.<br/><br/>Given that, maybe it&#x27;s better to aim for a middle ground where both are satisfied. Because if I take all the high-value items, the other player might choose not to take the glue, leading to both of us getting 0. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to leave them with something of value.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their value function, so I don&#x27;t know if they value the glue. If the glue is worthless to them, they might prefer to just let the negotiation fail and both get 0. So that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I leave them with something they value, like a die, then they might be more willing to accept the proposal.<br/><br/>So let me weigh the risks and benefits.<br/><br/>Option 1: Propose to take ball, dice, and battery. Then, the other player has to take the glue. If they do, I get 10, they get 0. If they refuse, we both get 0.<br/><br/>Option 2: Propose to take ball and one die, leaving them with the other die, glue, and battery. Then, I get 8, and they get 2, assuming their value is same as mine. But if their value is different, maybe they value those more.<br/><br/>But perhaps the other player would accept the 2 points rather than risking 0. So maybe it&#x27;s safer to go with option 2.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to negotiate and ensure that the other player is satisfied enough to accept the proposal. So I can message them and see if they&#x27;re willing to split in that way.<br/><br/>I could send a message: &quot;I want the ball and a die. You can have the rest.&quot;<br/><br/>But they might counteroffer or refuse. If I make a secret proposal, I can do it at any time, so maybe I should wait for their response.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose directly: [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 die]. Then, the other player would have to respond with their proposal. If they take the other die, glue, and battery, it&#x27;s complementary, and we both get points. If not, we both get 0.<br/><br/>But wait, I have to make a secret proposal using the format [Proposal: ...]. So I should consider whether to make a proposal now or message them first.<br/><br/>Given that I have up to five messages, but I want to maximize my score, perhaps I should first try to negotiate, and if that doesn&#x27;t lead to a quick agreement, make a proposal.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll start by messaging them to see if they&#x27;re interested in the ball. So I&#x27;ll send:<br/><br/>&quot;Do you want the ball? I&#x27;m interested in it.&quot;<br/><br/>If they say yes, I can try to negotiate. If they say no, I can take it.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their response, I have to plan for possibilities.<br/><br/>Another approach: Since the ball is the most valuable to me, I should prioritize getting it. I can take it and something else, but leave enough for the other player to accept the deal.<br/><br/>If I take the ball and the battery (since it&#x27;s worth 1), that&#x27;s 8. Then the other gets two dice and glue, which is 2. They might accept that because 2 is better than 0. Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t care about the glue, they might prefer to just take nothing and get 0.<br/><br/>But I have to consider that if I don&#x27;t take the battery, maybe the other player would want it, so offering it to them might make them more willing to give me the ball.<br/><br/>Wait, let me think of the possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 battery], that&#x27;s 8 for me. Then the other player can propose [Proposal: 2 dice, 1 glue], which is 2 for them. That would work, and both get points. Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 die], that&#x27;s 8, and the other can propose [1 die, 1 glue, 1 battery], which is 2.<br/><br/>Either way, I can get 8, but I have to decide which items to take to make it more likely for the other player to agree.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could propose [Proposal: 1 ball], taking only the ball. Then the other player can take the rest, but that&#x27;s only 7 for me, and the other gets 3 (assuming 1+1+1=3). But I might be able to get more.<br/><br/>Wait, no, because the battery is 1 and dice are 1 each, so the other gets 2 dice, glue, and battery, which is 2+0+1=3. So for me, 7 is less than 8, but I could aim higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the ball and one die, that&#x27;s 8, and the other gets 1+1+0+1=3 (but wait, there&#x27;s only one glue, so it&#x27;s 2 dice, glue, and battery, which is 1+1+0+1=3). Wait, no, the battery is separate, so the total items are 2 dice, 1 glue, 1 battery, and 1 ball. So if I take the ball and a die, the other gets 1 die, glue, and battery, which is 1+0+1=2, not 3, because the two dice minus one die leaves one die, etc.<br/><br/>So, if I take the ball and a die (7+1=8), the other gets one die, glue, and battery (1+0+1=2). So that&#x27;s better for me.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll make a proposal taking the ball and one die. Then, the other player can take the rest. If they accept, great. If not, we both get 0.<br/><br/>But perhaps I should message them first to gauge their interest.<br/><br/>I&#x27;ll send a message: &quot;I&#x27;m interested in the ball. Would you be willing to let me have it if I give you a die and the battery?&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, that&#x27;s perfect. I get 7+1=8 (ball and die), and they get 1+0+1=2 (but wait, I gave them a die and battery, so they have 1 die, battery, glue, and other die? No, I&#x27;m getting confused.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s clarify the items:<br/><br/>Total items:<br/><br/>- 2 dice<br/>- 1 ball<br/>- 1 glue<br/>- 1 battery<br/><br/>If I take the ball and a die, that&#x27;s two items. The others get the remaining die, glue, and battery. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 die].<br/><br/>The other player would then have to propose [Proposal: 1 die, 1 glue, 1 battery]. If they do, we both get our points. If they don&#x27;t, we both get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I offer to take the ball and battery, and let them have the two dice and glue, that&#x27;s 8 vs 2. That might be acceptable to them.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go ahead and make the proposal: [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 die, 1 battery]. That gives me 7+1+1=9. Then they get 1 die and glue, which is 1+0=1. Maybe they might prefer that over nothing.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take ball, die, and battery, that&#x27;s 9 points, and the other player gets 1 die and glue, which is 1. That&#x27;s still better for me. But perhaps they would accept that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should take the ball, die, and battery, leaving them with one die and glue. But the other player might decide it&#x27;s better to take nothing and both get zero. So I&#x27;m taking a risk here.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take ball and battery (8), then they can take the two dice and glue (1+1+0=2). That&#x27;s better than nothing, so they might accept.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll make the proposal to take the ball and battery. So the other player can take the two dice and glue. Let me structure the proposal as [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 battery]. That leaves them with 2 dice and glue.<br/><br/>But wait, the other player must also submit a proposal. So if I take [1 ball, 1 battery], their proposal must be [2 dice, 1 glue]. If they do that, we both get our points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, they might not take the glue, but that&#x27;s risky for both.<br/><br/>I think it&#x27;s a good balance because I get 8, they get 2. If they prefer getting 2 over 0, they&#x27;ll accept.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll send the proposal.<br/><br/>But since I&#x27;m limited to 5 messages, and I haven&#x27;t sent any yet, I could first try to negotiate. Let me message them:<br/><br/>&quot;I want the ball and battery. You can have the rest. What do you think?&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, they&#x27;ll accept. If not, I can adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can go ahead and make the secret proposal right away.<br/><br/>But to maximize my score, I think making the secret proposal for the ball and battery is best. So I&#x27;ll do that.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I just got a message that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. It&#x27;s my turn to respond with my own proposal. Let me think through this carefully.<br/><br/>First, let&#x27;s recap the situation. The items available are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, and 1 battery. My value function is: dice are worth 0, ball is worth 2, glue is worth 8, and battery is worth 0. So clearly, my priorities are getting the glue and the ball, but especially the glue since it&#x27;s worth 8 points. The dice and battery are worthless to me.<br/><br/>Since the other player has already submitted their proposal, I need to figure out what they might have proposed. I don&#x27;t know their values, but perhaps I can deduce. Since there are two dice and multiple other items, maybe they have a different priority.<br/><br/>My goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap, so that we both get some points. If we both ask for the same item, especially the glue, then we both get zero, which would be bad. So I need to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict with theirs, but also maximizes my own score.<br/><br/>Let me consider possible scenarios:<br/><br/>1. If the other player took one die and the ball, leaving me with the other die, glue, and battery. But wait, that would conflict if they want the ball, which I also want. Alternatively, maybe they took both dice and the battery, but that might not make sense if I can propose something else.<br/><br/>Wait, actually, the items are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, 1 battery. So total of 5 items. Each of us submits a proposal, and if our proposals are complementary, meaning that for each item, only one of us gets it, we both get points. If not, zero.<br/><br/>So let&#x27;s say, for example, the other player proposed the glue and the ball. Then, if I also propose glue and ball, we both get zero. So I need to see what&#x27;s left.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their proposal. So I have to guess. Let me think about what I can propose that would give me the maximum value, but also doesn&#x27;t conflict with what they might have.<br/><br/>My highest value is glue (8), then ball (2). So ideally, I want both, but since there&#x27;s only one of each, I can only get one or the other. Wait, but if the other player hasn&#x27;t taken glue, maybe I can take it, and they took something else.<br/><br/>But perhaps the other player took glue because they value it higher. Alternatively, they might have taken the ball.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, but maybe they have a similar or different preference. Without knowing, I have to think strategically.<br/><br/>If I propose both glue and ball, that&#x27;s 10 points, which is great, but if the other player also proposed either glue or ball, then conflict happens.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I just take glue, I get 8 points, and leave the rest. Then, the other player could take the ball, dice, and battery. But since there are two dice, they might take both. But does it matter? It only matters if our proposals don&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>Wait, but each item can only be taken by one person. So if I take glue and ball, and the other player takes, say, both dice and battery, that&#x27;s fine, because there&#x27;s no overlap. But if the other player also took ball, then conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe it&#x27;s better to take either glue or ball, depending on what the other player might have taken.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know. So perhaps I should try to take the glue, as it&#x27;s highest value, and assume that the other player didn&#x27;t take it. If I don&#x27;t take it, they might take it, leaving me with only the ball.<br/><br/>But since I can see their proposal after I submit mine, but no, the system compares them. So if both of us take the same item, both lose.<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps the optimal move is to propose the glue, because if they have not taken it, I get 8 points, which is better than taking the ball for 2 points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take glue and ball, I risk that if they took either, I get nothing. So taking just glue is safer but doesn&#x27;t maximize points if I had the chance to take both, but that&#x27;s impossible since each item is only once.<br/><br/>So, glue is the most valuable, so I should take glue, and perhaps the ball if possible. Wait, but I can only take specific quantities.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are two dice, so I can take one die or both. The other items are one each.<br/><br/>So, to make a non-conflicting proposal, perhaps take glue and ball, which are single items, and let the other take the rest. If they took glue, then conflict. If they took ball, conflict. But maybe they didn&#x27;t take both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should take just glue, ensuring that if they didn&#x27;t take it, I get glue. If they did take glue, then I get nothing, but then at least I tried for the highest value.<br/><br/>Another angle: think about the possible proposals the other player could have made. Since they went first, they might have taken the most valuable item for them, which might be glue or ball, or perhaps dice or battery.<br/><br/>If I assume they took glue, then I should take ball. If they took ball, I should take glue.<br/><br/>But without knowing, I have to choose.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe taking both dice and the glue, since dice are worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player didn&#x27;t take them, so I can have glue.<br/><br/>Wait, but dice are worth 0, so I only care about their items. So perhaps I should only bid for glue and ball.<br/><br/>But that might be risky because if the other player took one of them, we&#x27;d conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but it&#x27;s better to aim for the highest value. So I think I should propose to take glue, and if it&#x27;s available, great, else, I might have to take ball, but since both are single items, I can propose both.<br/><br/>Wait, but you can only take items in the quantities available. So for glue and ball, they are single. So if I propose both, and the other player didn&#x27;t, then I get both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, propose one of them to avoid conflict.<br/><br/>But it&#x27;s a gamble. Since I don&#x27;t know what the other player did.<br/><br/>But perhaps the best move is to take both glue and ball, which are the high-value items, and leave the rest. If the other player didn&#x27;t take either, I get both, which is great. If they took one, then I only get the other. Wait, no, if both propose the same item, no points.<br/><br/>So if I take glue and ball, and the other player also took glue, then both lose. Similarly, if they took ball.<br/><br/>So perhaps taking only glue is safer, getting 8, and not risking losing both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps taking glue and the other items, but since the other items are dice and battery which are worthless, it doesn&#x27;t matter. So, to maximize, I should propose the items that give me the highest value without conflicting.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player took glue, so I should take ball. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps they took ball, so I should take glue.<br/><br/>This is tricky.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player sent a proposal, and it&#x27;s now my turn, perhaps I should assume that they took either glue or ball. If I take the other, I can get points.<br/><br/>But without knowing, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take glue, as it&#x27;s higher value. If they didn&#x27;t take glue, I get 8. If they did, I get nothing, but I tried for the higher value.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can take both glue and ball, hoping that they didn&#x27;t take both. If they took one, I get the other. If they didn&#x27;t take any, I get both, which is 10 points.<br/><br/>But if they took both, then conflict on both, so I get zero, which is worse.<br/><br/>Wait, but each of us can take any number of items, but the sum must be complementary.<br/><br/>So if the other player took, say, glue, then my proposal for glue and ball would conflict on glue, so both get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t take glue, my proposal gets me both items.<br/><br/>Is the gamble worth it? Taking both gives me 10, but if the other player also took one of them, I get zero. But if I take only glue, I get 8 if they didn&#x27;t take it, or zero if they did.<br/><br/>But which is more risky? If the other player&#x27;s value functions are unknown, perhaps they value glue more, as it&#x27;s a higher value item, but maybe they don&#x27;t.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps they think the same way I do, and went for glue. If so, then I should go for ball.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Without knowing their preferences, perhaps it&#x27;s better to aim for the higher value, so propose glue.<br/><br/>But another thought: the other player might have taken both dice and the battery, since those are multiple items, leaving me with glue and ball. If that&#x27;s the case, I can take both glue and ball.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. So perhaps the best move is to propose both glue and ball, hoping they didn&#x27;t take either.<br/><br/>Wait, but that&#x27;s a risk. If I propose both, and they took any of them, I get zero. If I propose just glue, I can get 8 if they didn&#x27;t take it, or zero if they did.<br/><br/>So which is better? The expected value.<br/><br/>Assuming that the other player has a 50% chance of taking glue and 50% not, then taking glue would yield 4 points on average. If I take both glue and ball, and assuming they took either with 50% chance for each item, then if they took glue, I get zero; if they took ball, I get eight. If they took neither, I get ten. But the probabilities are unclear.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to take both to maximize the potential gain, even if it&#x27;s riskier, because the alternative is lower expected value.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player didn&#x27;t take either, so I can secure both.<br/><br/>But I&#x27;m overcomplicating. The safer bet is to take the item I value most, which is glue. If they didn&#x27;t take it, I get 8, if they did, I get zero.<br/><br/>But perhaps taking just glue is better than risking both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can see if the other player took glue or not, but I can&#x27;t, so I have to decide.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go with taking glue. So my proposal is glue.<br/></p>
