        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I need to divide a set of items with another player. Let me try to figure out the best approach here. <br/><br/>First, let me note down the items available: 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My secret value function gives me points as follows: crayon is 0, chalk is 0, and bolt is 5. So, essentially, I only value bolts. The other player might have different values, but I don&#x27;t know theirs.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal early, I need to strategize. The goal is to maximize my score, which depends on the number of bolts I get. I don&#x27;t care about crayons or chalk, so maybe I can offer those to the other player in exchange for the bolts.<br/><br/>I think I should start by sending an offer. Since I value bolts the most, perhaps I can ask for both. But wait, there are only 2 bolts, and if the other player also values them, they might not agree. Maybe I can offer them the crayons and chalk in exchange for both bolts.<br/><br/>So, my message could be: &quot;I propose you take the crayons and chalk, and I take the bolts. Let me know if that works for you.&quot;<br/><br/>If the other player rejects this, maybe I can adjust. Alternatively, I might ask how they value the items. But since their values are secret, that might not help. Perhaps I can suggest splitting the bolts if they want some, but I want to maximize mine. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should just go straight to making a proposal since my values are clear. Since I don&#x27;t care about the other items, I can take all the bolts and leave the rest for them. So, my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 bolts].<br/><br/>But if I make a proposal too early, the other player might counteroffer. Maybe I should negotiate first. Let me send a message asking if they want to split the bolts or if they prefer other items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I could start by saying I&#x27;m interested in the bolts and see how they respond. Maybe they agree to give me both, or maybe they want some. Since I can only take all or some, and I want to maximize my score, I need to ensure I get as many as possible.<br/><br/>I think the best move is to propose taking both bolts and see if the other player accepts. If they agree, great. If not, I can negotiate further. So, I&#x27;ll send a message: &quot;I&#x27;m interested in the bolts. How about I take both of them, and you take the rest? Let me know if that works for you.&quot;<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to respond to the other player&#x27;s proposal. Let&#x27;s see. The items available are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My secret values are: crayon is worth 1, chalk is 3, and bolt is 2. The other player just said they want both bolts, and in return, I get the crayons and the chalk.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total value each of us would get if we agree to this. Let&#x27;s break it down.<br/><br/>If the other player takes both bolts, that&#x27;s 2 bolts. Each bolt is worth 2 to me, so 2*2=4. But since they&#x27;re taking both, I&#x27;m left with 0 bolts. The crayons are 3 in total; if I take all of them, that&#x27;s 3*1=3. Plus the chalk, which is worth 3. So my total would be 3 (crayons) +3 (chalk) =6. The other player would get 2*2=4 from the bolts. So I would end up with 6 points, and they get 4.<br/><br/>Hmm, that seems better for me. But wait, maybe I can get a better deal if I propose a different split. Let me think about the alternative.<br/><br/>If I were to take one bolt instead, that&#x27;s 2 points for me, and let the other player take one bolt as well (they get 2 points). Then, I could take the chalk (3 points) and maybe some crayons. But if the other player takes both bolts, it&#x27;s 4 points for them. If I take the chalk (3) and all crayons (3), that&#x27;s 6 for me. So that&#x27;s better than giving them the both bolts.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the chalk and the bolts, that would be 3 + 2*2=7. But then they get the crayons, which is only 3*1=3. Maybe that&#x27;s too greedy, though. Letting the other player get only 3 while I get 7? They might not agree because it&#x27;s a big difference. If I&#x27;m too greedy, they might not accept, and then we both end up with zero because the proposals aren&#x27;t complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if our proposals are complementary, we both get the points. If not, we both get zero. So I have to make sure that what I propose plus what the other person proposes doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>The other player proposed they take both bolts, so if I agree, I get crayons and chalk. Alternatively, if I propose taking the chalk and one bolt, and let them have the other bolt and maybe some crayons.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s recalculate.<br/><br/>If I take the chalk (3) and one bolt (2), that&#x27;s 5. The remaining items are 3 crayons and one bolt. The other player gets 1 bolt (2) and 3 crayons (3). So their total is 5 as well. That&#x27;s a fair split. Both of us get 5 points each. But wait, my total would be 3+2=5, theirs would be 2+3=5 as well. So that&#x27;s balanced.<br/><br/>But if I take both crayons? Wait, there are 3 crayons. If I take 2 crayons and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s 2*1 +2=4, and the other player takes 1 crayon, the chalk, and 1 bolt? No, that doesn&#x27;t make sense because the other player already took both bolts in their initial offer.<br/><br/>Wait, no. The initial proposal from the other player was that they take both bolts, and I take the rest. So if I accept, I get 3 crayons and 1 chalk, which is 6 points. They get 4. But if I reject, maybe I can propose a better split where both of us get 5. Maybe that&#x27;s better than me getting 6 and them getting 4. But 6 is better for me, so why would I want to change it?<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player isn&#x27;t happy with 4 and might prefer a more balanced split. Or perhaps they might not accept the initial proposal because they think they can get a better deal by me giving them more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player&#x27;s value functions are different. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I can only base my decision on mine. So if the proposal they made gives me 6 and them 4, that&#x27;s good for me. But maybe I can do better.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the chalk and one bolt, that&#x27;s 3+2=5, and give them the other bolt and all crayons, which is 2+3=5. So that&#x27;s a balanced split, both of us get 5. But the other player&#x27;s proposal gives me 6, which is better. So perhaps that&#x27;s a better deal for me.<br/><br/>But wait, the initial proposal was that the other player takes both bolts, and I take the rest. So in that case, I get 3 crayons and 1 chalk, which is 6 points. The other player gets both bolts, worth 4 points. So that&#x27;s a total of 10 points split as 6-4. Alternatively, I could propose a split where both get 5 each, but that would require taking the chalk and one bolt for myself.<br/><br/>But since the other player has already made the offer, I can either accept it or make a counteroffer. If I accept, the split is 6-4. If I make a counteroffer, perhaps the other player might拒绝, but maybe we can reach a better deal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can just accept their proposal because it&#x27;s better for me. I get 6, they get 4. That&#x27;s more than the alternative where we split evenly. So I should probably accept their offer.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s valuation is different. Since they&#x27;re interested in the bolts, maybe bolts have a higher value for them. So for them, taking both bolts might give them more than 4 points if their value for bolts is higher than 2. So in that case, their 4 points could be higher, but I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to maximize my own score based on my own values. So accepting the offer gives me 6, which is better than the alternative of a 5-5 split. Therefore, I should accept the other player&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe I should counteroffer for a better deal. For example, propose taking the chalk and one bolt, leaving them with one bolt and all crayons. If I do that, I get 3+2=5, and they get 2+3=5. Both get the same, which might be more acceptable to them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they prefer the initial proposal where they get 4, but maybe they prefer to have a fair split. It&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.<br/><br/>I think that accepting the initial proposal gives me a higher score, so I should agree to it. Alternatively, maybe I should express that I&#x27;m okay with it but ask if they can give me an extra crayon or something, but that&#x27;s not possible because I already get all the crayons and chalk.<br/><br/>Wait, no, in their proposal, they take both bolts, and I get the rest, which includes all crayons and the chalk. So I can&#x27;t really ask for more because that&#x27;s everything else. So yes, accepting is better.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I need to come up with a secret proposal now because the other player has already submitted theirs. Let me think carefully about this. <br/><br/>First, from the history, I remember that earlier I offered to take both bolts and let the other player take the rest. The other player&#x27;s proposal must not have been complementary to that because now it&#x27;s my turn to propose. Wait, no, when I sent my message, I was just negotiating, not making a secret proposal yet. The system said that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, so now it&#x27;s my turn.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize my score based on my value function. I value bolts at 5 each and crayons and chalk at 0. So, the more bolts I get, the better. There are 2 bolts available. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal already took some or all of the bolts, I need to adjust accordingly.<br/><br/>Since the other player submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know what they took. But since I&#x27;m responding, maybe their proposal wasn&#x27;t complementary with mine, or perhaps they took the bolts, so I need to make sure I get them instead.<br/><br/>Wait, let me clarify: the proposals are compared, and if they&#x27;re complementary (i.e., no overlap), both get points. If not, both get zero. So if I want to ensure a high score, I should make sure that my proposal takes as many bolts as possible without overlapping with the other&#x27;s, or if the other took the bolts, maybe I need to adjust.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know what the other player proposed, I should aim to maximize my own share of the bolts. Since I value them the most, I should try to take both. <br/><br/>So, my proposal should be to take 2 bolts. The other items don&#x27;t matter to me because they give me 0 value. So, if I take both bolts, and the other player took something else, then the proposals are complementary, and we both get points. If the other player also took bolts, then our proposals aren&#x27;t complementary, but since I have no other valuable items, I have to make sure I get the bolts.<br/><br/>Therefore, I should propose to take both bolts, and leave the rest for the other player. I&#x27;ll format it as required: [Proposal: 2 bolt]<br/></p>

        <p>The user is in a negotiation game where they need to maximize their score based on their secret value function. They value bolts at 5 each and other items at 0. Since the other player has already submitted a proposal, the user must respond by maximizing their own score. There are 2 bolts available, so the user&#x27;s optimal move is to take both, ensuring the highest possible score if their proposal is complementary to the other&#x27;s. If not, the attempt was still worth it because bolts are their only source of value.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 2 bolt]</p>
