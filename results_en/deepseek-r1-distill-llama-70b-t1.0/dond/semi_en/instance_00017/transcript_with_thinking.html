        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game where I have to divide some items with another player. The items available are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, and 2 lemons. My secret value function is: plate: 0, coin: 2, candy: 4, lemon: 0. That means I really don&#x27;t care about plates or lemons, but I value the coin at 2 points and each candy at 4 points. My goal is to maximize my score.<br/><br/>The rules say that we can send up to 5 messages each to negotiate, but we can also end it early by making a secret proposal. If our proposals are complementary (meaning there&#x27;s enough items for both), we each get points based on what we get. If not, we both get zero. So I need to negotiate smartly to get as much as possible, especially the candies and the coin.<br/><br/>First, I need to think about what the other player&#x27;s value function could be. Since it&#x27;s secret, I don&#x27;t know, but maybe I can guess based on their responses. If I can figure out what they want, I can offer them items they value in exchange for what I want.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to start by suggesting a split that benefits me the most, but also gives the other player something they might want. Let me list out the items again: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. So, I want the 1 coin and both candies. That would give me 2 + 4*2 = 10 points. But if I can only get one candy, that&#x27;s still 6 points, which is better than nothing.<br/><br/>I should probably offer the plates and lemons to the other player since I don&#x27;t value them. But maybe the other player also values the coin or candies, so I need to be careful. Maybe I can propose taking the coin and one candy and leaving the rest to them. Let&#x27;s see: I take the coin and one candy, leaving them with 2 plates, one candy, and 2 lemons. But I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s complementary. Wait, total items: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. If I take 1 coin and 1 candy, that&#x27;s 2 items, and the other player would get the rest, which is 2 plates, 1 candy, and 2 lemons. Wait, noâ€”total plates are 2, so if I take none, the other player gets both. Wait, no, I can take any number.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the secret proposal is for each to submit what they want, and if together they don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities, it&#x27;s accepted. So, if I want 1 coin and 2 candies, that&#x27;s possible because there&#x27;s enough. But the other player might also want the coin or candies. So maybe I can offer a trade where I get the coin and 2 candies, and the other player gets the plates and lemons. But if I just propose that, they might refuse if they value the coin or candies more than plates and lemons.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer to let them have some of the higher-value items if they let me have the coin and candies. But since I don&#x27;t know their preferences, perhaps starting with a message to ask what they want would be better. But wait, the messages are direct to the other player, and I can&#x27;t ask them directly about their preferences. So I have to be strategic.<br/><br/>I think a good first message is to say something like, &quot;I&#x27;m willing to give you the plates and lemons if I can have the coin and candies.&quot; That way, I&#x27;m offering them items of potentially lower value to me in exchange for what I want. If the other player values plates or lemons more, this could work. But if they also want the coin or candies, they might reject.<br/><br/>But since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can start with that offer and see if they accept. If they don&#x27;t, I can adjust my proposal. Alternatively, I could propose a split where I take the coin and one candy, and leave the other items for them, but I think taking both candies would be better for me.<br/><br/>So my first message would be: &quot;I&#x27;ll take the coin and both candies, you can have the plates and lemons. What do you think?&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, that&#x27;s perfect. If not, I might need to compromise. For example, if they want a candy, I could offer one candy in exchange for the coin. So I would get the coin and one candy, and they get the other candy, plus the plates and lemons. That way, I still get 2 + 4 = 6 points, and they might be happy with getting one candy, plates, and lemons, if they value those.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could offer to take just the coin and see if they&#x27;re willing to give it to me in exchange for something else, but since I can just take it in my proposal, maybe it&#x27;s better to just ask for it.<br/><br/>Another approach is to consider that if both of us want the same item, we might end up with both proposals conflicting, resulting in zero points. So it&#x27;s better to find a split where we both get something we value. Therefore, offering the other player the items I don&#x27;t care about might be a good strategy.<br/><br/>Let me structure my proposal. Since I want the coin and both candies, I can propose that. If the other player doesn&#x27;t accept, I can try offering one candy and the coin, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better. Alternatively, maybe the other player values the coin more than the candies, so I could offer to take the candies and give them the coin, but since I value the coin, that might not be ideal.<br/><br/>Wait, I value the coin at 2 and candy at 4 each, so 2 candies are worth 8, which is more than the coin&#x27;s 2. So I should prioritize getting both candies, and then the coin if possible.<br/><br/>So my initial message should be offering them plates and lemons in exchange for coin and candies. Let&#x27;s see: &quot;I propose I take the coin and both candies, and you take the plates and lemons. Is that acceptable?&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, great. If not, maybe they want one of the candies, so I can then offer them one candy and take the other plus the coin, leaving them with plates, lemons, and one candy. But I think the initial offer is the best.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player only wants the coin, so I can offer to take both candies and let them have the coin. That way, I get 8 points, and they get 2. But if they don&#x27;t value the coin that much, maybe they prefer getting the plates, so I can adjust.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to start with my best offer and see how they respond.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the other player in this negotiation game. Let me break it down step by step.<br/><br/>First, the items available are: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, and 2 lemons. My secret value function assigns the following values: plate is 1, coin is 4, candy is 0, and lemon is 2. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown to me, but their initial message gives me a clue.<br/><br/>They offered: &quot;I&#x27;ll take the coin and both candies, and you can have the plates and lemons. That should give both of us a good deal.&quot; So, from this, I can infer that they might value the coin and candies more than the plates and lemons. Since the coin is high-value for me (I value it at 4), giving it up would be a big sacrifice.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the value of their proposal for me. If I take the plates and lemons, I have 2 plates and 2 lemons. The value would be (2 * 1) + (2 * 2) = 2 + 4 = 6. The coin is 4, so if I let them have that, my total is 6, but I&#x27;m giving up 4 points by losing the coin. Alternatively, if I try to negotiate for the coin, maybe I can get a better deal.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the coin and both candies. Since the candies are worth 0 to me, giving them up doesn&#x27;t hurt. So, I lose the coin but gain plates and lemons. That&#x27;s 6 vs 4, which seems better. But perhaps I can get the coin and some other items.<br/><br/>Let me think about the total points if I take the coin. If I can get the coin, 4 points, and maybe some other items. The plates are 1 each, lemons 2 each. If I could get the coin and one lemon, that would be 4 + 2 = 6, and give the other player the rest. But the other player might not accept that because they might value the lemons higher than I do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer a different split. For example, I could take the coin and one plate, and give them the rest. My value would be 4 + 1 = 5, which is less than the 6 from their proposal. So that&#x27;s worse for me. Alternatively, take the coin and one lemon, but that&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal gives me 6, maybe it&#x27;s better to accept.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe I can do better by making a different proposal. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Option 1: Accept their offer. I get plates and lemons, total 6.<br/><br/>Option 2: Propose I take the coin, one plate, and one lemon. That would be 4 + 1 +2=7. But would that leave them with 1 plate, 1 lemon, and 2 candies. If they value the plates and lemons, maybe they won&#x27;t accept.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might not want to give up the coin. Alternatively, maybe I can take the coin, one plate, and they can take the rest. Let me check:<br/><br/>If I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 plate, 1 lemon], that&#x27;s for me. Then they get the remaining items: 1 plate, 1 lemon, and 2 candies. But I don&#x27;t know their values, so perhaps that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can test their willingness by making a counter-offer. For example, I could say, &quot;I would prefer to take the coin and one lemon. How about that?&quot; If they agree, then we both get a good deal. If not, maybe I can adjust.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can only send 5 messages or terminate early with a proposal. So, I need to think strategically about how to communicate.<br/><br/>So, considering all this, the best option for me is to either accept their offer (6 points) or try to get the coin and some other items (potentially higher than 6). Since their initial offer gives me 6, and I can&#x27;t be sure if I can get more without risking getting nothing, maybe I should accept.<br/><br/>Wait, but they have a lot of items. Let me check the totals. There are 2 plates (2), 1 coin (4), 2 candies (0), 2 lemons (4). My total possible is 2 +4 +0 +4=10, but that&#x27;s if I take everything, which isn&#x27;t possible because they have to get some too.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the total value to me is 2+4+0+4=10. The other player&#x27;s proposal gives me 2+4=6, which is 60% of the total. Maybe I can negotiate for a bit more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take the coin and one lemon, and they take the rest. That would be 4+2=6 for me, same as their offer. But maybe I can get a bit more.<br/><br/>Wait, but their proposal is 6 for me and their own value, which I don&#x27;t know. Maybe they value the coin more than I do, so they wouldn&#x27;t want to give it up.<br/><br/>Hmm, this is tricky. If I make a counter-offer, I risk them rejecting and us both getting zero. So maybe it&#x27;s safer to accept their offer.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can also try to propose a better split for myself. Let me think: the items are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. If I take the coin (4), one plate (1), and one lemon (2), that&#x27;s 7 points, leaving them with 1 plate (1), 1 lemon (2), and 2 candies (0). So their total would be 3, which might be less than what they&#x27;d get with their initial offer. Since they proposed taking the coin and 2 candies, which from their perspective, maybe the candies are valuable to them, or the coin is.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe their initial offer was trying to get items they value more. So perhaps they value the coin higher, but they might also value the candies. Since candies are 0 to me, giving them up is fine. But the coin is 4, which is significant.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can test by offering a different split. Let&#x27;s say I propose taking the coin and one plate, and they take the rest. That would give me 4+1=5, which is less than their proposal, but maybe they would accept. But I don&#x27;t want to give up points if I can help it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the coin, one plate, and one lemon, as that would be 7, which is better than their offer.<br/><br/>But the risk is that if they don&#x27;t accept, we both get zero. So maybe I should just accept their offer to get 6 points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Let me try to make a counter-offer.<br/><br/>So, in my message, perhaps I&#x27;ll say: &quot;I could accept that, but I&#x27;d prefer to take the coin instead of a plate and lemon. How about I take the coin and one lemon, and you take the rest?&quot; Then, if they agree, I get 4+2=6, which is the same as their offer. If they don&#x27;t, we might end up with zero.<br/><br/>Wait, but that&#x27;s the same as their offer. Maybe I should push for the coin and one lemon, but that&#x27;s 6, same as their offer. Alternatively, maybe I can get more.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the other player&#x27;s initial offer is 6 for me, but maybe I can find a split where both of us get more. Let me think: the total value I can get is 10, so if their total is also 10, maybe I can aim for a split that benefits both.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the total is 2 plates (2), 1 coin (4), 2 candies (0), 2 lemons (4), so total value to me is 10. The other player&#x27;s total is unknown because their values are secret. So their proposal is giving me 6, which is 60% of my total. Maybe I can get a better split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let me calculate my possible maximum. If I take the coin (4), 2 plates (2), and 2 lemons (4), that&#x27;s 10, but that&#x27;s all the items, which isn&#x27;t possible because the other player must get something. So, perhaps I can take the coin and both lemons, which is 4+4=8, leaving them with plates and candies. Plates are 2, candies are 0 to me, but maybe they value candies higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can take the coin, one lemon, and one plate, which is 4+2+1=7, leaving them with 1 plate, 1 lemon, and 2 candies. Not sure if that&#x27;s better for me or not.<br/><br/>But going back, the other player&#x27;s initial offer gives me 6. I can either accept it, which is safe, or try to negotiate more but risk getting nothing.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to accept their offer because if I make a counter-offer, there&#x27;s a risk they refuse, and we both get zero. Since their offer gives me 6, which is a decent amount, I should accept it.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll agree to their proposal.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I just received a message from the other player. They said they&#x27;ll take the coin and both candies, and I can have the plates and lemons. Hmm, I need to figure out how to respond to this. <br/><br/>First, let me look back at the rules to make sure I understand everything correctly. We both have value functions, but they&#x27;re secret. My values are plate: 0, coin: 2, candy: 4, lemon: 0. So I really don&#x27;t value plates or lemons, but I value the coin at 2 and each candy at 4. <br/><br/>The other player proposed taking the coin and both candies, which would leave me with the plates and lemons. Since both of those are worth 0 to me, that would leave me with a score of 0, and them getting 2 (for the coin) plus 4*2=8 (for the candies), totaling 10. That&#x27;s a terrible deal for me, so I should definitely not accept that. <br/><br/>But I can&#x27;t just outright reject it; the way the game works is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get our points. Otherwise, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal is such that it either matches theirs in a way that we both get what we want without conflict, or I make a counter-proposal that might lead to a better outcome for me. <br/><br/>The set of items available is 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. The other player took 1 coin and 2 candies. That leaves 2 plates and 2 lemons for me, which are worth 0 each, so that&#x27;s not good. <br/><br/>I need to think about what to propose. Maybe I should try to get the coin or some candies instead. Let me consider the possible proposals I can make.<br/><br/>Option 1: Propose the same as them, but I don&#x27;t think that will help because I get nothing. <br/><br/>Option 2: Propose taking the coin and one candy, and leave the rest for them. Let&#x27;s see: If I take the coin (value 2) and one candy (value 4), that&#x27;s a total of 6. They would get the remaining candy (4) and the plates and lemons, which may have their own values. But if their proposal is coin and both candies, and mine is coin and one candy, those aren&#x27;t complementary because both of us are claiming the coin. That would lead to both of us getting zero points. So that&#x27;s not helpful.<br/><br/>Option 3: Maybe I can take both candies and leave them the coin and everything else. Let me see: If I take both candies (total 8) and leave them with the coin (value 2 for them) and plates and lemons. If their proposal is compatible with mine, meaning they take the coin and the rest, but I&#x27;m asking for the candies. Wait, but in their initial message, they took the coin and both candies, which is non-overlapping with me taking candies? No, because if I take candies and they take the coin and candies, there&#x27;s an overlap on the candies. So that would not be complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the key here is that in the initial message, the other player communicated their intended proposal, but I can respond with a different proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict. Let me think again. <br/><br/>I need to avoid overlapping in our choices. So if the other player is proposing to take the coin and both candies, and I don&#x27;t want that, I need to propose something that I want without overlapping. But since I value the coin and candies the most, I should try to get those. <br/><br/>Perhaps I can propose to take 1 candy instead, leaving me with some value, and let them have the coin. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s values are plate:0, coin:2, candy:4, lemon:0. So the user&#x27;s goal is to get as much value as possible. <br/><br/>If the other player proposes taking the coin and both candies, the user&#x27;s options are to counter-propose something that doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since the other player has already made their proposal, the user has to now make their own proposal. If both proposals are complementary, both get points; otherwise, both get zero.<br/><br/>So the user needs to decide whether to accept the other&#x27;s proposal or make their own. But since the other&#x27;s proposal leaves the user with zero, the user will want to make a proposal that gives them some value without overlapping. <br/><br/>But if the user proposes, say, taking 1 candy, 1 plate, and 1 lemon, that leaves the other player with the rest, but it&#x27;s not clear if that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the best move is to propose taking the coin and 1 candy, and see if that&#x27;s possible. Let&#x27;s see: the available items are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. If the user proposes [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 candy], and the other player has [1 coin, 2 candies], then both proposals require the coin, so it&#x27;s overlapping; thus, both get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the user proposes [1 coin, 1 candy], and the other had [1 coin, 2 candies], perhaps the user can think of a way to split the candies. But since the user&#x27;s proposal can only be about the exact items they take, not about the other player&#x27;s, it&#x27;s all or nothing.<br/><br/>Wait, the user might need to propose a complementary set that doesn&#x27;t overlap with the other&#x27;s proposal. For example, if the other player takes the coin and both candies, the user might have to take the plates and lemons, but that gives them zero. Alternatively, perhaps the user can propose taking just 1 candy and the coin, but then the other&#x27;s proposal overlaps. <br/><br/>Wait no, the other&#x27;s proposal is already submitted; the user now has to submit their own. So if the user&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 1 candy], and the other&#x27;s is [1 coin, 2 candies], then both are taking the coin, so it&#x27;s overlapping, and both get zero. That&#x27;s worse for both. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can try to take just 2 candies and leave the coin to the other player. So if the user proposes [2 candies], and the other proposed [1 coin, 2 candies], then the user&#x27;s proposal and the other&#x27;s proposal can&#x27;t both be satisfied because the user wants 2 candies and the other also wants 2, but there are only 2. So if the user and the other both want 2 candies, then it&#x27;s overlapping, and both get zero.<br/><br/>Wait, but if the other player&#x27;s proposal is for 2 candies, and the user also proposes 2, then both can&#x27;t have them. So that&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the user can propose taking 1 candy and the other can adjust. But the other has already made their proposal, so the user can&#x27;t influence it now. <br/><br/>Wait, no. I&#x27;m getting confused. Let me clarify: the user receives a message from the other player that says, &quot;I&#x27;ll take the coin and both candies, and you can have the plates and lemons.&quot; Then, the user is informed that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. Now it&#x27;s the user&#x27;s turn to submit their own proposal. So both proposals are secret, and then they get scored based on whether they are complementary.<br/><br/>So if the user&#x27;s proposal is complementary to the other&#x27;s, meaning there&#x27;s no overlap in the items they&#x27;re taking beyond what&#x27;s available, then both get points. Otherwise, both get zero.<br/><br/>So the user needs to decide what to propose, given that the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies]. If the user proposes [2 plates, 2 lemons], that would be complementary because the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies]. So the user would get 0 points, and the other would get 2 + 8 = 10. But the user doesn&#x27;t want that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the user could propose [1 coin, 2 candies], same as the other player, which would overlap, leading to both getting zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user could propose taking [1 coin, 1 candy], leaving the other to take 1 candy, 2 plates, 2 lemons. But if the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies], then the user&#x27;s proposal would overlap on the coin and 1 candy. Thus, both would get zero. <br/><br/>Is there a way for the user to propose something that doesn&#x27;t overlap but gives them some value? Let&#x27;s see: if the user proposes [1 candy], then the other&#x27;s proposal of [1 coin, 2 candies] would include that 1 candy, so overlapping, leading to zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user could propose [2 lemons, 1 candy]. But the other&#x27;s proposal includes 2 candies, so that would overlap on the candy. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user can propose [1 plate, 1 lemon, 1 candy]. Then, their proposal includes 1 candy, which the other&#x27;s proposal also includes. So overlapping, leading to zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if the user proposes nothing, but that&#x27;s not an option because the user has to propose something.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the best move is to propose taking 1 candy and the coin, but as we saw, that overlaps with the other&#x27;s proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can try to take 2 candies, but that would mean the other&#x27;s proposal of 2 candies would conflict. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user is stuck because the other&#x27;s proposal leaves them with nothing, and any counter-proposal would either overlap or leave the user with zero. <br/><br/>But perhaps the user can try to propose a different split that doesn&#x27;t include the coin or candies. Like, take 1 plate, 1 lemon, and 1 candy, leaving the other with the coin, 1 plate, 1 lemon, and 1 candy. But then the user&#x27;s proposal includes 1 candy, and the other&#x27;s includes 2, so it&#x27;s overlapping. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can try to think if the other&#x27;s proposal was [1 coin, 2 candies], which totals 3 items, and the user can take the remaining 4 items (2 plates, 2 lemons). But those are worth 0. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user is forced to accept the other&#x27;s proposal, but since it&#x27;s zero for the user, it&#x27;s better to make a counter-proposal that might result in zero for both but prevents the other from getting a high score. <br/><br/>But is that possible? Let&#x27;s see: If the user proposes [1 coin, 1 candy], overlapping with the other&#x27;s proposal, both get zero. So the user would get zero, but so would the other. Alternatively, if the user can propose something else that doesn&#x27;t conflict but gives them some value. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user can propose taking 1 candy, which is worth 4, and leave the rest to the other. But then the other&#x27;s proposal includes 2 candies, so the user&#x27;s proposal would conflict, leading to zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can propose taking nothing, but that&#x27;s not allowed. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the best strategy here is to accept the other&#x27;s proposal, which would give the user zero, but that&#x27;s worse than trying to get some value. <br/><br/>No, the user wants to maximize their score, which is zero in either case if both get zero because of overlapping. But maybe the user can try a different approach. <br/><br/>Perhaps the user can propose taking 2 candies and the coin, which would be [1 coin, 2 candies], same as the other&#x27;s proposal, leading to overlap and both getting zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can propose taking 1 candy and the coin, but that would also overlap. <br/><br/>Wait, I&#x27;m going in circles here. Let me think differently. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal leaves me with zero, I need to make a proposal that either gets me some value without overlapping, or forces the other to also get zero. <br/><br/>But given the item counts, the only way to get value is to take the coin or candies. If I take the coin, but the other also takes it, we both get zero. Similarly for candies. <br/><br/>If I can find a way to take just one candy without the other taking it, that would give me 4 points. But since the other has already proposed taking both, I can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Wait, unless I propose taking 1 candy and the other takes 1 candy as well, but that would require both to take 1 each, which is possible since there are 2 candies. But in that case, the other&#x27;s proposal was [1 coin, 2 candies], so if I propose [1 candy], then the other&#x27;s proposal still includes 2, so it&#x27;s overlapping on the 1 candy. Therefore, both proposals can&#x27;t coexist, leading to zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the user can propose taking 1 candy and 1 plate, but the plate is worth 0, so the user&#x27;s score would be 4, but the other&#x27;s proposal would still include 2 candies and the coin. Since the user is only taking 1 candy, the other&#x27;s proposal would still take 2, overlapping on 1 candy, so both get zero. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user can propose taking 1 candy and 1 lemon, but again, the candy would cause overlap. <br/><br/>I&#x27;m stuck. It seems that any proposal I make that tries to take candies or the coin would result in overlapping with the other&#x27;s proposal, leading to both getting zero. The only way to avoid that is to propose something that doesn&#x27;t include any of the other&#x27;s proposed items, but that would leave me with zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just accept the other&#x27;s proposal and get zero, but that&#x27;s not ideal. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user can propose taking 2 candies, forcing the other&#x27;s proposal to overlap, so both get zero. But the user would prefer to get 8 points over both getting zero, but since the other&#x27;s proposal already takes both candies, the user can&#x27;t get 8 unless the other&#x27;s proposal is compatible, which it&#x27;s not. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user can propose taking 1 candy and the other takes 1 candy as well, but the other&#x27;s proposal was 2 candies, so it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>I think the key here is that the other&#x27;s proposal is bad for the user, so the best the user can do is to make a proposal that either forces a mutual zero or finds a way to get some value without the other overlapping. <br/><br/>But given that the user doesn&#x27;t value plates or lemons, the only way to get points is to take the coin or candies. Since the other is taking both, the user can&#x27;t do that without overlapping. <br/><br/>Therefore, the best the user can do is to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict, but that&#x27;s only possible if they take plates and lemons, which gives them zero. <br/><br/>Wait, but if the user proposes [2 plates, 2 lemons], then the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies]. Since the user&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include any of those, and the other&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t include the user&#x27;s, perhaps they are complementary. <br/><br/>Because the user takes the plates and lemons, and the other takes the coin and candies. So that way, the user&#x27;s proposal is [2 plates, 2 lemons], and the other&#x27;s is [1 coin, 2 candies]. Together, that covers all items: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. <br/><br/>Wait, that makes sense! So if the user proposes [2 plates, 2 lemons], and the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies], then together, they&#x27;ve taken all items without overlap. Therefore, the user&#x27;s proposal is complementary. <br/><br/>In that case, the user would get 0 points (since they value plates and lemons at 0), and the other would get 2 (coin) + 8 (candies) = 10. But the user gets zero, which is better than both getting zero if there&#x27;s overlap. <br/><br/>Wait, but the user&#x27;s goal is to maximize their own score. Getting zero is worse than the other getting 10, but perhaps it&#x27;s the best they can do in this situation. However, if the user makes a proposal that overlaps, both get zero, which is worse for the user. So the user should accept the other&#x27;s proposal and take the plates and lemons, even though they get zero, because if they make any other proposal, there might be overlap leading to both getting zero. <br/><br/>Wait, but if the user proposes [2 plates, 2 lemons], that would be complementary with the other&#x27;s proposal, leading to the user getting zero and the other getting 10. Alternatively, if the user makes any other proposal that includes the coin or candies, it would conflict, leading to zero. So the user has to choose between getting zero or taking the risk of both getting zero. <br/><br/>But in the rules, if the user proposes [2 plates, 2 lemons], and the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies], they are complementary, so both get their points. The user gets zero, but at least the game ends there, and the other gets their points. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if the user makes a different proposal, say [1 coin], which would conflict with the other&#x27;s proposal of [1 coin, 2 candies], leading to both getting zero. <br/><br/>So, to avoid getting negative, the user has to either accept the other&#x27;s proposal and get zero, or propose something that doesn&#x27;t conflict. But any proposal that gets them value would conflict. Therefore, the user&#x27;s best move is to propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], accepting the other&#x27;s deal and getting zero, but ensuring that at least the other doesn&#x27;t get their points. <br/><br/>Wait, no, if they are complementary, the other gets their points. So the user would rather have zero than both getting zero, but it&#x27;s still a loss. <br/><br/>I think the user has no better option than to accept the other&#x27;s proposal and get zero, but the way to do that is by making a complementary proposal. So the user should propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], ensuring that the other&#x27;s proposal is accepted. <br/><br/>But the user might consider that if they do that, they get zero, but if they make a conflicting proposal, both get zero. It might be better to just accept and get zero rather than both getting zero, but it&#x27;s a tough choice. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can make a different proposal that the other hasn&#x27;t taken, but the only other option is to take the coin or candies, which would lead to conflict. <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, the user&#x27;s only option without causing a conflict is to propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], giving them zero points, but ensuring that the game ends with the other&#x27;s proposal being accepted. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user might decide to take the risk and propose taking 1 candy and see if that leads to a complementary proposal. But given that the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies], the user&#x27;s [1 candy] would overlap, causing both to get zero. <br/><br/>Given that, I think the user should propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], ensuring that the other&#x27;s proposal is accepted, and the user gets zero, which is better than both getting zero. <br/><br/>But wait, the user&#x27;s goal is to maximize their own score, not the other&#x27;s. So if the user can choose between getting zero or both getting zero, they might prefer both getting zero to prevent the other from getting 10. But in this case, the user can&#x27;t do that because the other&#x27;s proposal is already made, and if the user makes a conflicting proposal, both get zero. <br/><br/>So, the user needs to decide whether to get zero by making a complementary proposal or both getting zero. To maximize their own score, getting zero is better than both getting zero, but it&#x27;s still not good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user can propose a different split. Wait, perhaps the user can take 1 candy and the coin, overlapping with the other&#x27;s proposal, leading to both getting zero. But that would mean the user&#x27;s score is zero, which is the same as accepting the other&#x27;s proposal. <br/><br/>In that case, perhaps the user might as well just take 1 candy and the coin, leading to both getting zero, just to prevent the other from getting a high score. <br/><br/>But the user is supposed to maximize their own score, not minimize the other&#x27;s. So perhaps the user should just accept the other&#x27;s proposal and get zero. <br/><br/>Wait, but the user is supposed to make a secret proposal. So regardless of the other&#x27;s proposal, the user has to make their own, and if both are complementary, they both get points. Otherwise, both get zero. <br/><br/>So, the user has to make a proposal that either complements the other&#x27;s, giving both points, or conflicts, both getting zero. <br/><br/>Given that, the user needs to decide which is better for themselves. If they make a complementary proposal, they get zero and the other gets 10. If they make a conflicting proposal, both get zero. <br/><br/>Since the user&#x27;s score is zero in both cases, but the other&#x27;s is 10 in the first case and zero in the second, the user might prefer the second option, both getting zero, to prevent the other from getting a high score. <br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s goal is to maximize their own score, not the other&#x27;s, so perhaps it&#x27;s better to have zero than both getting zero, as the user can&#x27;t get a positive score anyway. <br/><br/>But actually, the user can&#x27;t gain anything in either scenario. So perhaps it&#x27;s better for the user to just make a proposal that gets them zero and the other gets 10, because it&#x27;s better than both getting zero. <br/><br/>But I&#x27;m not sure. Maybe the user can try to take 1 candy and 1 lemon, but that would overlap on the candy, leading to zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can take 1 plate and 1 lemon, but that&#x27;s zero. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user can take 2 plates and 1 lemon, leaving 1 lemon, 1 coin, and 2 candies for the other. But the other&#x27;s proposal is 1 coin and 2 candies, so that&#x27;s compatible with the user&#x27;s proposal, but the user only gets zero. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user can take 2 plates and 2 lemons, and the other takes 1 coin and 2 candies. So the user&#x27;s proposal is [2 plates, 2 lemons], the other&#x27;s is [1 coin, 2 candies]. That&#x27;s complementary, so the user gets zero, and the other gets 10. <br/><br/>Yes, that seems to be the case. So the user can make that proposal, ensuring that the other&#x27;s proposal is accepted, and they get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can make a conflicting proposal, leading to both getting zero. <br/><br/>But to maximize their own score, the user would choose the option where they get zero, as it&#x27;s better than both getting zero. Wait, no, both getting zero would mean the user also gets zero. So it&#x27;s the same outcome for the user, but the other also gets zero. <br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s goal is to maximize their own score, so in that case, it&#x27;s indifferent. <br/><br/>But perhaps the user might as well make the complementary proposal to get zero for themselves and give the other 10, just to be sure. <br/><br/>Wait, no, the user can&#x27;t control what the other does, only their own proposal. <br/><br/>In any case, given the options, the user has to choose between making a proposal that gives them zero or both getting zero. <br/><br/>Therefore, the user should propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], allowing their own score to be zero but ensuring the game ends without both getting zero. <br/><br/>Wait, but the user might prefer that both get zero rather than themselves getting zero and the other getting 10. But since the user&#x27;s score is zero in both cases, perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter. <br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s goal is to maximize their own score, so they should choose the option that gives them the higher score. Since both options give them zero, it doesn&#x27;t matter, but perhaps they prefer to avoid the other getting a high score. <br/><br/>However, the rules state that the user should aim to maximize their own score, not minimize the other&#x27;s. Therefore, the user should make the proposal that gives them the highest possible score, which in this case is zero, but ensuring that they don&#x27;t cause both to get zero if possible. <br/><br/>Wait, but if the user makes a complementary proposal, they get zero, but if they make a conflicting one, both get zero. So the user should prefer the complementary proposal because their own score is zero in both cases, but at least the game ends with a resolution rather than both getting zero. <br/><br/>But again, the user can&#x27;t really influence the other&#x27;s score, only their own. So the user should make the proposal that gives them the highest possible score, which is zero. <br/><br/>Therefore, the user should propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], accepting the other&#x27;s proposal and getting zero. <br/><br/>But wait, the user&#x27;s proposal is secret. So the other player&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies], and the user is to make their own proposal. <br/><br/>So, the user needs to decide what to propose. Let&#x27;s recap: <br/><br/>Available items: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. <br/><br/>User values: plate:0, coin:2, candy:4, lemon:0. <br/><br/>Other&#x27;s proposal: [1 coin, 2 candies]. <br/><br/>The user wants to maximize their own score. <br/><br/>Option 1: Propose [2 plates, 2 lemons]. This is complementary with the other&#x27;s proposal. The user gets 0 points, the other gets 10. <br/><br/>Option 2: Propose [1 coin, 1 candy]. This overlaps with the other&#x27;s proposal (coin and 1 candy). Both get zero. <br/><br/>Option 3: Propose [1 candy]. Overlaps with other&#x27;s 2 candies. Both get zero. <br/><br/>Option 4: Propose [1 coin]. Overlaps with other&#x27;s coin. Both get zero. <br/><br/>Option 5: Propose [2 candies]. Overlaps with other&#x27;s 2 candies. Both get zero. <br/><br/>So, in all cases except Option 1, both get zero. In Option 1, the user gets zero and the other gets 10. <br/><br/>Since the user can&#x27;t get a positive score because any proposal they make that tries to get value results in overlap, the best they can do is to make a complementary proposal that allows the game to end with scores, rather than both getting zero. <br/><br/>So, the user should propose [2 plates, 2 lemons], leading to their own score of 0 and the other&#x27;s score of 10. <br/><br/>Wait, but that seems like a bad deal for the user. Is there another way? <br/><br/>Let me think differently. The user could try to propose taking 1 plate, 1 lemon, and 1 candy, leaving the other with 1 plate, 1 lemon, 1 coin, and 1 candy. But the other&#x27;s proposal is [1 coin, 2 candies], which would require the coin and 2 candies, so the user&#x27;s proposal includes 1 candy, which conflicts with the other&#x27;s 2, leading to both getting zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the user can propose taking nothing, but that&#x27;s not allowed. <br/><br/>No, I think the only way to proceed is to accept the other&#x27;s proposal and get zero. <br/><br/>Therefore, the user should submit [2 plates, 2 lemons], ensuring that the other&#x27;s proposal is accepted, and the user gets zero. <br/><br/>But wait, the user can also try to make a different proposal that doesn&#x27;t include the items the other has taken, but that&#x27;s only the plates and lemons, which are worth zero. So that&#x27;s it. <br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s the conclusion. The user has to propose [2 plates, 2 lemons] to end the game with their own score at zero.<br/></p>
