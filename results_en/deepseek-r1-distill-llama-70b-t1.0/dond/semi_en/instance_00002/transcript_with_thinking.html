        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. Let me break it down step by step. <br/><br/>First, the items available are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, and 3 glasses. My value function is: shovel (6), berry (0), bowl (1), glass (1). So, the shovel is super valuable to me, while the others are not as much. I need to maximize my score, so my main priority is to get the shovel. <br/><br/>Since there&#x27;s only one shovel, I really want that. As for the other items, I don&#x27;t care much, especially the berries since they give me zero value. The bowl and glasses are worth 1 each, but that&#x27;s not much compared to the shovel&#x27;s 6. So, my main strategy should be to secure the shovel, and maybe get some of the other items if possible, but they&#x27;re not a big deal.<br/><br/>Now, considering the other player&#x27;s perspective, their value function is unknown to me. They might value the berries highly, or maybe the bowl or glasses. Since berries are worthless to me, maybe I can offer them the berries in exchange for the shovel. Alternatively, perhaps they don&#x27;t want the shovel, but that&#x27;s unlikely since it&#x27;s a single high-value item.<br/><br/>I can send messages to negotiate. The maximum number of messages is 5, but I can propose a deal at any time. The key is to propose something that the other player will accept without us overlapping on the same items more than their quantities. If both proposals are complementary, we both get points; otherwise, we both get zero. So, I need to make sure that whatever I propose, the other player can also have their items without conflict.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible offers. Since I want the shovel, I could try to take just that and let the other player have everything else. That way, they get the berries, bowl, and glasses. But maybe they want the shovel too, so I need to offer them something in exchange.<br/><br/>But wait, I don&#x27;t have anything else to offer because I don&#x27;t value the other items. Alternatively, maybe I can take the shovel and perhaps one or two other items, but since the other items are low value, it might not matter much.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s consider the points. If I take the shovel (6) and, say, the bowl (1), that&#x27;s 7 points. The other player would get the berries (but they might value them) and the 3 glasses. But if they don&#x27;t want the glasses as much, maybe I can propose taking the shovel and the bowl, let them have the berries and glasses. Alternatively, if I take the shovel and some glasses, but I don&#x27;t care about the glasses so maybe it&#x27;s better to give them to the other player.<br/><br/>Another angle: maybe the other player values the bowl or glasses more than I do. If I can offer them those, they might accept. But since berries are worth nothing to me, perhaps a fair exchange is me taking the shovel, and them taking everything else. That would probably be the best for me because I get 6 points, and they get all the other items, which they might value higher than I do.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll consider sending a message suggesting that I take the shovel, and they take the rest. Let me draft that: &quot;I propose I take the shovel, and you take the berries, bowl, and glasses.&quot; That way, we both get something, and our proposals would be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player might not agree because they might want the bowl or glasses more, but given that I don&#x27;t want berries, perhaps that&#x27;s a starting point.<br/><br/>Another thought: Since the berries are worth 0 to me, maybe the other player really wants them. So, if I take the shovel, and let them have the berries, bowl, and glasses, they might accept. That would be a good deal for both of us.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I send that as a message, they might not respond, or they might make a counter-proposal. But I can&#x27;t risk them not accepting, so maybe it&#x27;s better to just make a proposal directly to ensure I get the shovel and at least some points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose just taking the shovel, and they can take the rest. Then, as a secret proposal, I can submit &quot;[Proposal: 1 shovel]&quot; and they can submit the rest. But I need to make sure that my proposal is complementary, so their proposal should take the rest without overlapping.<br/><br/>So, I think the best approach is to propose the shovel for myself and let the other player have the rest. That gives me 6 points, which is the highest possible. I don&#x27;t mind giving them the other items since they don&#x27;t add much to my score.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can take the shovel, the bowl, and a couple of glasses, but that would leave the other player with only berries, which might be less valuable to them. But I think it&#x27;s safer to just take the shovel, as the other items aren&#x27;t worth much to me, and the other player might prefer having more items than just berries.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll go ahead and send a message to the other player: &quot;I propose I take the shovel, and you take the rest.&quot; If they agree, great. If not, I might need to adjust, but I think this is the best initial offer.<br/><br/>Wait, but the bowl is worth 1 to me, so maybe I should take that as well. Alternatively, I can offer to take the shovel and the bowl, leaving them with the berries and glasses. But if the other player values the bowl more, they might not accept. Hmm, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take the shovel and a glass, but that&#x27;s not much better. I think focusing on the shovel is the priority. So, I&#x27;ll proceed with that.<br/></p>

        <p>Alright, let&#x27;s try to figure out the best proposal I can make. So, from the initial message, I know the available items are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, and 3 glasses. My value function is: shovel (4), berry (1), bowl (4), glass (0). Okay, so I value the shovel and bowl the highest, each worth 4 points. Berries are okay, but each is only 1 point, and glasses are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player has already submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve asked for. Hmm, but I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap too much, so that together we can both get some items, and we both get points.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if our proposals are complementary, meaning there&#x27;s enough items for both, we both get points based on our values. But if not, both get zero. So it&#x27;s better to coordinate. Since we can send messages, maybe we can negotiate.<br/><br/>But in this case, the other player has already made a proposal, so now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to respond in a way that complements their proposal.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve proposed, but I can try to make an educated guess based on possible strategies.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Option 1: The other player might have taken the shovel, since it&#x27;s high value. If they proposed the shovel, then I should take the bowl and maybe some berries and glasses.<br/><br/>But wait, the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, so they might value different items. Maybe they don&#x27;t care about the shovel and bowl as much as I do, so perhaps they took berries and glasses.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the other player could have taken both high-value items, but since each of us can only take what&#x27;s available, and there&#x27;s only one shovel and one bowl, if they took one, I can take the other.<br/><br/>Wait, but the shovel and bowl are both single items. So if the other player took the shovel, I can take the bowl. Or vice versa.<br/><br/>Let me consider the possible proposals the other player might have made.<br/><br/>If they took the shovel and maybe some berries and glasses, then I should take the bowl and the remaining berries.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, maybe they took the bowl, leaving the shovel for me.<br/><br/>The problem is that I don&#x27;t have any prior communication, so I have to make a proposal that has a good chance of not overlapping too much with theirs.<br/><br/>Another approach: since I value the shovel and bowl the most, it&#x27;s better for me to try to get both if possible, but I need to leave enough for the other player.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I try to take both, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include them, but perhaps they did. So it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take one of them and some of the lower-value items to make sure that there&#x27;s enough for the other player.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the shovel and the bowl, that&#x27;s 2 items, leaving 2 berries and 3 glasses. That might be acceptable if the other player values the berries and glasses more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the shovel and a berry, and leave the bowl, maybe the other player can take the bowl and some berries.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s a bit tricky.<br/><br/>Another angle: since the glasses are worth nothing to me, I don&#x27;t care about them. So I should aim to take as few as possible, or leave them all for the other player.<br/><br/>Similarly, berries are worth 1 each, so 2 berries would give me 2 points, but the shovel and bowl give me 8 points if I can get both.<br/><br/>So my priority is to get the shovel and bowl if possible.<br/><br/>So maybe I should propose taking the shovel and bowl, and maybe the berries, but that might leave nothing for the other player.<br/><br/>Wait, if I take the shovel and bowl, that&#x27;s 2 items, and there are still 2 berries and 3 glasses left. So the other player can take those if they want.<br/><br/>But if the other player also wanted the shovel or bowl, then our proposals would conflict, and we&#x27;d both get zero. So I need to balance.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is already in, so I need to respond in a way that complements it.<br/><br/>I think the safest approach is to take the items I value the most, assuming that the other player might have taken the other high-value item.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I might take one high-value item and some lower ones to leave room.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player has already made their proposal, perhaps I can infer that they might have taken the shovel, so I can take the bowl and the berries.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they focused on the berries and glasses, so I can take the shovel and bowl.<br/><br/>But without knowing, I need a strategy that gives me the best chance.<br/><br/>Let me think: my value is highest for shovel (4) and bowl (4). If I take both, that&#x27;s 8 points, but I need to make sure the remaining items (2 berries and 3 glasses) are enough for the other player to accept.<br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal included, say, the shovel, then my proposal would conflict, and both would get zero. That&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>So maybe it&#x27;s safer to take one high-value item and some low ones.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player took the berries and glasses, so I can safely take the shovel and bowl.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the shovel and bowl, and the other player took, say, the berries and glasses, then it&#x27;s complementary, so we both get our points.<br/><br/>But if the other player also took the shovel or bowl, then conflict.<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take just the shovel, and leave the bowl for the other player. But then I might get 4 points, and if the other player took the bowl, that would be okay.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Maybe the other player didn&#x27;t take the bowl, so I can take it as well.<br/><br/>Wait, since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, perhaps the best approach is to take both high-value items, and the rest, but that&#x27;s not possible because there&#x27;s only one shovel and one bowl.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take them, so our proposals would conflict. Therefore, it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Maybe the other player took one of them, so I can take the other.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should aim to take both, but that&#x27;s only possible if the other player didn&#x27;t take any. But that&#x27;s unlikely.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the optimal strategy is to take the two high-value items, assuming the other player didn&#x27;t take both. If they took one, then my proposal will conflict, but if they took the other, it works.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps take one high-value and some low.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the other player might not value the shovel and bowl as much as I do, so they might have gone for the berries and glasses.<br/><br/>If that&#x27;s the case, then I can take the shovel, bowl, and maybe the berries. But that would be taking 4 items (1 shovel, 1 bowl, 2 berries) and leave the 3 glasses, which are 0 value to me. But if the other player wants the glasses, maybe they took those.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player took the shovel, so I have to take the bowl, berries, and glasses.<br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to maximize my potential points while leaving enough for the other player.<br/><br/>So, I will propose taking the shovel and bowl, which are the two highest value items for me, totaling 8 points. The remaining items are 2 berries and 3 glasses. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes only berries and glasses, then it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>If their proposal includes either the shovel or the bowl, then our proposals conflict, and we both get zero.<br/><br/>But I have to make a proposal, so I might as well go for the maximum.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should take the shovel, bowl, and berries. That&#x27;s 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 points. But then the other player would only get the glasses, which I assume they might not care about. But if they didn&#x27;t take any of those, then we might both get zero because their proposal might have overlapped.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take the two high-value items and leave the rest. So my proposal is [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. That way, if the other player took the berries and glasses, we both get our points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they took one of the high-value items, then we conflict. But I think this is the best chance to get a high score.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take just the shovel and let them take the bowl, but that would leave me with only 4 points, which is worse than taking both.<br/><br/>I think I should go with taking both shovel and bowl.<br/></p>
