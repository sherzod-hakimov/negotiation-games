    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to divide these items with the other player. We both want to maximize the sum of our scores, which means we need to find a way to split the items so that the total of both our values is as high as possible. But since we can only send a few messages, we need to negotiate effectively.<br/><br/>First, let me list out the items and their quantities:<br/><br/>- 1 potato<br/>- 1 glove<br/>- 2 rulers<br/>- 1 whistle<br/>- 2 cards<br/><br/>My value function is:<br/><br/>- potato: 0<br/>- glove: 1<br/>- ruler: 3<br/>- whistle: 1<br/>- card: 1<br/><br/>So, I value rulers the most, followed by glove, whistle, and card, which are all 1 each, and potato is 0. The goal is to get as many high-value items as possible without conflicting with the other player&#x27;s choices, so that we both get points.<br/><br/>I know that the other player has their own secret value function, which I don&#x27;t know. So I need to make educated guesses or suggest a division that could be mutually beneficial.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s think about possible divisions.<br/><br/>Since there are two rulers, maybe both of us can get one each. That way, we both get a high-value item. If the other player values rulers highly, taking one each would be a good start.<br/><br/>The gloves, whistle, and cards are all single or limited. Since the potato is worth 0 to me, I can perhaps offer that to the other player if needed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both rulers since I value each at 3, which is the highest. Let me see: if I take both rulers, that would give me 6 points. But does that leave enough for the other player to also get points? They would need to get some of the other items, which are lower value but might add up.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take both rulers, maybe they can get the glove, whistle, and the two cards. But I need to check the quantities. The other items are 1 glove, 1 whistle, and 2 cards. So they could take all of those, which are 1+1+2=4 items. But the total is 1+1+2+2=6 items, so if I take 2 rulers, that&#x27;s 2 items, and they can take the remaining 4. But perhaps that&#x27;s a way to split it.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player also values rulers highly, so we need to see if taking one each is better for both.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible messages to send. Since I can only send 5 messages, I should be concise.<br/><br/>First, I can suggest taking one ruler each, since that&#x27;s the highest value item for me, but I don&#x27;t know about them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could ask what they think about splitting the rulers.<br/><br/>Wait, messages can just be tentative proposals or suggestions, so maybe I can propose a split and see if they agree.<br/><br/>Let me try sending a message suggesting that I take one ruler, and they take one ruler, and then we split the rest as needed. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can propose my proposal and see if they can complement it.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps it&#x27;s better to make a clear proposal to see if it&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>If I take 1 ruler, 1 glove, then the other items can be divided as needed.<br/><br/>But let me think about the total value. If I take 1 ruler (3 points), 1 glove (1), and maybe a card or whistle, but I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, I can focus on taking the highest value items.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should first ask the other player what they think about splitting the rulers 1 each, and then see how to split the remaining.<br/><br/>But the problem is that we can only send 5 messages, so I need to be efficient.<br/><br/>Another approach is to make a proposal that I take both rulers and give them the rest, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s fair.<br/><br/>Wait, but my goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores, not just my own. So if I take both rulers, I get 6 points, and the other player gets the rest: glove (1), whistle (1), and two cards (2), totaling 4. So together, 10 points. If instead, we split the rulers, each taking one, then I get 3, and the other player gets 3 for the ruler, and then we split the rest. Let&#x27;s say I take the glove (1) and a card (1), and they take the whistle (1) and the other card (1). Then my total is 3+1+1=5, theirs is 3+1+1=5. Total is 10 as well. So both ways, it&#x27;s the same total.<br/><br/>But perhaps if the other player values some items higher, the total could be more. For example, if they value the glove more, maybe they would get more from taking the glove and a ruler.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values the glove or whistle more than the ruler, so taking one ruler each is better.<br/><br/>I think the key is to maximize the total, so I need to find a split where the sum of both of our values is as high as possible.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I can make a proposal that maximizes the potential for both.<br/><br/>Maybe I should suggest taking the two rulers for myself, but that might leave the other player with lower-value items, but perhaps they have higher value for some of them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose taking one ruler, glove, and a card, leaving the other ruler, whistle, and card for them.<br/><br/>But perhaps it&#x27;s better to start by making a specific proposal, perhaps offering a split and seeing if it&#x27;s acceptable.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll propose taking both rulers, since that&#x27;s where I get the most value, and then give them the rest. Alternatively, offer to split the rulers.<br/><br/>Wait, another approach: Since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, perhaps I can get them to reveal their preferences through messages. But with only 5 messages, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>I think it&#x27;s best to propose a split that gives me the highest possible without leaving them with nothing. Maybe taking one ruler, glove, and a card, and see if that works.<br/><br/>So, I would propose:<br/><br/>Proposal: 1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card.<br/><br/>That leaves the other player with 1 ruler, whistle, and 1 card. Then, both of our totals would be:<br/><br/>Me: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5<br/><br/>Other: 3 (ruler) + 1 (whistle) +1 (card) = 5<br/><br/>Total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 rulers, I get 6, and other gets 1 (glove) +1 (whistle) +2 (cards) =4, so total 10.<br/><br/>Same total. But maybe the other player would prefer to get a ruler.<br/><br/>Hmm, perhaps the other player values the ruler more. If they do, then each taking one ruler is better for the total.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t, then taking both rulers is fine.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. So perhaps suggesting a split of 1 ruler each would be better to maximize the total.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can propose taking both rulers, and see if they accept, but that might leave them with lower items, but perhaps they have higher values for those.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I think the best approach is to suggest a split that includes both rulers, as that&#x27;s the highest value, and then let the other player respond.<br/><br/>Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the sum is the same whether we split the rulers or not, so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Therefore, I can choose either way.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should take the items I value most, which are the rulers, and offer them the rest.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll propose taking both rulers, and give them the rest.<br/><br/>So, my proposal would be: [Proposal: 2 rulers]<br/><br/>But wait, that leaves them with potato, glove, whistle, and 2 cards. But the potato is 0 for me, but maybe it&#x27;s higher for them.<br/><br/>But if I send that, they might not accept, or perhaps they can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, no, because if I propose [2 rulers], and they propose something else, if it&#x27;s complementary, we both get our points.<br/><br/>But perhaps I should offer a more comprehensive proposal that covers all items.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should send a message asking them what they prefer. For example, &quot;Do you want 1 ruler each, or should I take both?&quot;<br/><br/>But I can only send messages without using square brackets, so I can ask that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can propose a split of one ruler each, and then discuss the remaining items.<br/><br/>Wait, but I have to make sure the proposals are complementary to get points.<br/><br/>So, perhaps the best approach is to make a specific proposal covering all items, so that if they agree, we can get the points.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll think about a split that maximizes the total.<br/><br/>Suppose I take 1 ruler, 1 glove, and 1 card. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then they take 1 ruler, whistle, and 1 card. That covers all items except the potato, which is 0 for me, so perhaps giving it to them doesn&#x27;t matter.<br/><br/>But wait, the potato is only 1, so perhaps I should include it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can take the potato, but it&#x27;s 0, so it&#x27;s better to give it to them if they value it.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I can propose:<br/><br/>I take 1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card.<br/><br/>They take 1 ruler, 1 whistle, 1 card, 1 potato.<br/><br/>So, my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card]<br/><br/>And their complementary proposal would be [Proposal: 1 ruler, whistle, 1 card, potato]<br/><br/>This way, all items are allocated, and we both get points.<br/><br/>My total would be 3 + 1 +1 = 5.<br/><br/>Their total would be 3 (ruler) +1 (whistle) +1 (card) + 0 (potato) =5.<br/><br/>Total sum 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 rulers, my total is 6, and they get 1+1+2=4 (assuming they value the other items as 1 each), which also sums to 10.<br/><br/>But perhaps if they value the potato higher, then including it would give them more.<br/><br/>Wait, but the potato is 0 for me, but perhaps they have a higher value. Let&#x27;s say their potato value is x. Then, if I include it, their total increases by x. So, if x is positive, then giving it to them increases the total sum.<br/><br/>Therefore, I should include the potato in their share.<br/><br/>So, when making my proposal, I should include all the items I want, and the rest go to them.<br/><br/>So, if I take 2 rulers, gloves, that&#x27;s 2 items, and then they can take the rest: 1 potato, 1 whistle, and 2 cards.<br/><br/>But wait, gloves is only 1, so perhaps I should take 1 glove.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should take 2 rulers and the glove, and they take the rest.<br/><br/>So, I propose [1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card], and they can take [1 ruler, potato, whistle, 1 card].<br/><br/>But I&#x27;m complicating it. Maybe it&#x27;s better to just send a proposal covering all the items I want, and let them respond.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can take 1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card, and 1 potato, but since potato is 0, it doesn&#x27;t hurt me.<br/><br/>Wait, no, because taking potato would prevent them from taking it, but it&#x27;s 0 to me, so better to give it to them if they value it.<br/><br/>So, perhaps my proposal is: [1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card]<br/><br/>And they can take: 1 ruler, 1 whistle, 1 card, and 1 potato.<br/><br/>This covers all items, and we both get some value.<br/><br/>Wait, let me count the items:<br/><br/>Total items: 1 potato, 1 glove, 2 rulers, 1 whistle, 2 cards: total 7 items.<br/><br/>My proposal: 1+1+1=3 items, theirs: 1+1+1+1=4 items. Wait, but the cards are 2, so if I take 1 card, and they take 1 card, that covers it.<br/><br/>So, my proposal would be: [1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card]<br/><br/>Leaving them with: 1 ruler, 1 whistle, 1 card, 1 potato.<br/><br/>But I should check if that&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>Yes, because I take 1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card, and they take the remaining 1 ruler, whistle, card, and potato.<br/><br/>So, the total is covered, and we both get 5 points each, sum 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 rulers, glove, and they take the rest, sum is also 10.<br/><br/>But perhaps if I take the glove as well, their total would be lower if they don&#x27;t value the rest as much.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps taking the glove is better for me since it&#x27;s 1, and the other items are lower for me.<br/><br/>Hmm, perhaps I should just go ahead and propose taking 1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card, and let them decide.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to make it more efficient, maybe I can take 1 ruler, 1 glove, and 1 card, and leave the rest to them.<br/><br/>Yes, that seems reasonable.<br/><br/>So, my proposal is [1 ruler, 1 glove, 1 card], which leaves them with 1 ruler, whistle, 1 card, and potato. That way, we both get 5 points each, sum 10.<br/><br/>I think this is a fair split, maximizing both our scores.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m playing this negotiation game, and I need to figure out what to propose after the other player has already made their proposal. Let me see. The items available are 1 potato, 1 glove, 2 rulers, 1 whistle, and 2 cards. My secret values are potato:7, glove:0, ruler:0, whistle:3, card:0. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown to me, so I have to make an educated guess based on their proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player already submitted a secret proposal. I need to respond with a proposal that complements theirs so that we both get points. If our proposals don&#x27;t conflict, we both get our respective scores. If not, both get zero. Since I want to maximize both our scores, I need to see what they asked for and then take what&#x27;s left.<br/><br/>Hmm, but I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. So I need to think about what&#x27;s best for me. My top priority is the potato, which gives me 7 points. Then the whistle, which gives 3. So I should aim to get both if possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but there&#x27;s only one potato and one whistle. If I can get both, that&#x27;s 10 points for me. But maybe the other player also wants them. Alternatively, if they take something else, I can get those.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, I have to make a proposal that covers my highest value items and leaves the rest for them. Let me think: I should probably take the potato and whistle, since they&#x27;re my highest values. So maybe I&#x27;ll propose &quot;[Proposal: 1 potato, 1 whistle]&quot;. That way, I leave the glove, 2 rulers, and 2 cards for them. Hopefully, their proposal doesn&#x27;t include what I&#x27;ve taken.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they proposed taking the potato, then I can adjust, but since I don&#x27;t know, I have to go first. Wait, no, they already proposed, so now it&#x27;s my turn to respond. So actually, I should look at their proposal and then take whatever&#x27;s left. But I don&#x27;t have their proposal info here, so I might need to make an assumption.<br/><br/>Wait, in the scenario given, the user is me, so perhaps I&#x27;m to assume that the other player&#x27;s proposal is already in, and I have to respond. But in the problem, the user says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, so it&#x27;s now my turn. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict with theirs, but since I don&#x27;t know what theirs is, perhaps I should take the items I value most and see.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the game, the proposals are revealed after both have submitted, so perhaps my best bet is to take the items I value most and hope that the other player didn&#x27;t take the same. Or maybe I can try to maximize my own score while leaving some for the other player. Since I don&#x27;t know their preferences, I should focus on getting my top items.<br/><br/>So, given that, I should propose taking 1 potato and 1 whistle. That gives me 7 + 3 = 10 points. The rest of the items are glove, 2 rulers, 2 cards. If the other player has proposed taking those, then we&#x27;re good. If they proposed taking, say, the potato, then my proposal conflicts, and we both get zero. But without knowing, I have to maximize my own gain.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can take only the potato, leaving the whistle for them, but that would give me 7, and if they take the whistle, that&#x27;s 3 for them. But perhaps they have higher values on other items. I&#x27;m not sure.<br/><br/>Wait, let me structure this:<br/><br/>Items available:<br/><br/>1 potato (7)<br/><br/>1 glove (0)<br/><br/>2 rulers (0 each)<br/><br/>1 whistle (3)<br/><br/>2 cards (0 each)<br/><br/>My values: potato is highest, then whistle. Others are 0.<br/><br/>So, to maximize my score, I should take potato and whistle. But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, perhaps I should take just one of them and leave the other. Or maybe both.<br/><br/>If I propose both, I get 10 points, which is great if they don&#x27;t want those. If they do want one or both, we might conflict. But since their proposal is secret, I have to make my best guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can just take the potato and leave the whistle, hoping the other player doesn&#x27;t take it, so that in their proposal, if they took the whistle, we might have a conflict. But without knowing, I think the best approach is to go for the highest value for myself. So I&#x27;ll propose taking the potato and whistle.<br/></p>
