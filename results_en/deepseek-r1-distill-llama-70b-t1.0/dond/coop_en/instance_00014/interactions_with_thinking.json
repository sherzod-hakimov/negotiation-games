My goal is to maximize both my score and the other player's score. \n\nFirst, I need to understand my own value function. I value a mirror at 1 point, a brick at 4, a knife at 1, and a comb at 1. So I really value the brick the most. My first thought is that I should probably try to get the brick because it gives me the highest value. But I also need to think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I'll have to make some educated guesses based on the items.\n\nThe items are limited, so we have to make sure our proposals are complementary. If we both propose and our proposals don't clash, we both get points; otherwise, we both get zero. So communication is key here. \n\nI have up to five messages to negotiate, but I can end it early if I think a proposal is feasible. Let me think about what the other player might want. They could be looking for high-value items too, maybe the brick or something else. Maybe they also have a high value for the mirrors, knives, or the comb. I don't know. \n\nLet's see, the items: 2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, 1 comb. If I take the brick, that's 4 points for me. But the other player might also want that, so maybe I should see if they're willing to give me the brick in exchange for something else. Or perhaps I can take the brick and some other items that I value less, but the other player might value more.\n\nAlternatively, if I take multiple lower-value items that add up to a good score, that could be better. For example, if I take both mirrors, that's 2 points, but if I take the comb and a mirror, that's 2 points as well. But then, the brick is still more valuable. \n\nWait, but if I only take the brick, that's 4 points for me, but the other player can take the rest: 2 mirrors, 3 knives, and 1 comb. Their total would be based on their own values. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should try to maximize the total points between both of us. \n\nWhat's the maximum total points possible? It depends on the other player's values, but if we can distribute the items in a way that both get high-value items, that's ideal. Since I don't know their values, perhaps I should focus on getting the highest value items for myself while ensuring they can also get their high-value items.\n\nI could try to propose taking the brick and some other items. Let me think about the quantities. There's only 1 brick, so I can take it. The other items are multiple, so I can also take one or two. But I don't know what the other player wants.\n\nMaybe I should start by messaging the other player to see what they value. Let's say I send a message like, \"What do you think about splitting the items? Do you have preferences?\" That would be my first message. \n\nAlternatively, I could try to be more direct and say, \"I really want the brick, would you be okay with that?\" But maybe that's too forward. If I propose it, they might refuse if they value the brick highly. \n\nWait, actually, since our goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores, it's better if both of us get the items we value most. So if I take the brick and some low-value items for me, but high for them, that could be better. But without knowing, it's tricky.\n\nLet me try to outline the possibilities. If the other player values the brick highly, they might want it. So maybe I should offer them some other items that I don't value as much in exchange for letting me have the brick. Or perhaps we can split the lower-value items.\n\nWait, but I only care about my points and their points, so maybe the best is to ensure that high-value items (brick) go to whoever values them more. Since I don't know their values, perhaps I should make a proposal that allows both of us to get a good share.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the total number of items is 7, but we don't have to take all. But probably, taking all would maximize the points.\n\nLet me think of possible splits. Since I need to make a proposal, perhaps I should try to take the brick and one mirror. Then the other player can take the other mirror, the comb, and the three knives. But I don't know if that's optimal.\n\nWait, maybe I should just go for the brick and leave the rest. Alternatively, take the brick and some knives. But I don't know if that's the best approach.\n\nI think I'll start by sending a message to the other player to see if they have a preference or if they're open to a particular split. Maybe say something like, \"I think we can both get a good score if we divide the items wisely. What are your thoughts? Maybe I take the brick and a few others?\"\n\nWait, but I have to make sure that whatever I propose, the other player can accept without overlapping. So perhaps I should propose taking the brick and maybe some mirrors or knives, and see if they counterpropose something different.\n\nAlternatively, I could make an initial proposal, and if they reject, negotiate further. But since I can only send five messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me plan this step by step.\n\nFirst message: Ask the other player about their preferences. Something like, \"Do you have specific items you want, or should we try to split them evenly in value?\"\n\nIf they respond, I can adjust. If not, proceed to make a proposal.\n\nSuppose they don't respond, I might propose taking the brick and two mirrors, leaving them with the rest. Or maybe the brick and the comb, since the comb is unique. But the comb is only 1 point for me, same as the mirrors and knives.\n\nBut since the brick is 4, that's significant. Maybe I should focus on getting the brick and then see what else I can get without overlapping.\n\nWait, if I take the brick and two mirrors, that's 1*2 +4=6 points. The other player would get 3 knives and 1 comb, which for me would be 1*3+1=4, but their values could differ. But I don't know their values, so it's hard to tell if that's good for both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player would prefer the mirrors, so taking the brick and one mirror, and leaving the other mirror and comb for them. Then I have 1 +4=5, they have 1+1=2, plus three knives. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since the brick is unique, perhaps I can offer them some items in exchange for letting me take it. For example, I take the brick, and they can take two mirrors, three knives, and the comb. But I don't know if they would prefer that.\n\nI think the safest approach is to try to get the brick and as many low-value (to me) items as possible, to leave high-value items (to them) for themselves. But since I don't know their values, perhaps focusing on getting the brick and one or two other items that I value less but they might value more.\n\nSo, perhaps propose taking the brick and the comb. That's 4+1=5 points for me, leaving them with two mirrors and three knives. If they value mirrors or knives highly, that might be good for them.\n\nAlternatively, taking the brick and a mirror. 4+1=5, leaving them with the other mirror, comb, and three knives.\n\nI think I should make a proposal. Let's say I take the brick and the comb. So my proposal would be \"[Proposal: 1 brick,1 comb]\". Then, the other player gets the two mirrors and three knives. \n\nWait, but the other player might not value the comb, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe I should also take some knives. Wait, no, I have to make sure that the other player's proposal, whatever it is, doesn't conflict with mine.\n\nWait, actually, when making a secret proposal, both have to submit their own, and if they don't overlap, both get points. So my proposal should include the items I want, and their proposal should include what they want. If there's no overlap, we both get the points.\n\nTherefore, I should aim for a set of items that don't overlap with what they might want. So perhaps taking the brick and the comb is a good idea because the other player might take the mirrors and knives.\n\nBut wait, I can also take some mirrors or knives if I want, but I have to make sure that their proposal doesn't include what I take. So maybe it's better to take items that are unique or less in number.\n\nAlternatively, since the mirrors and knives are multiple, the other player can take some and I take some. But again, without knowing their preferences, it's hard.\n\nWait, but if I take the brick and the comb, that's 2 items, leaving 2 mirrors and 3 knives. The other player can take all of those. Alternatively, they might want some specific number.\n\nAlternatively, I can take the brick and two mirrors, leaving the rest. But again, don't know.\n\nI think the safest is to take the brick and the comb, as that's 5 points for me, and the other player can take the rest. So let me make that proposal.\n\nBut just to be safe, maybe I should also take a knife or a mirror in case they don't want the comb. Wait, no, the proposal must be specific. So I have to decide what I want.\n\nAlternatively, I can take the brick, one mirror, and one knife, but that might leave the other player with less. Hmm.\n\nI think I'll go with taking the brick and the comb. So my proposal is [Proposal:1 brick,1 comb]. Let me send that.\n\nBut wait, the other player might also want the comb. Then our proposals would overlap, and we both get zero. So maybe I should take the brick and a mirror instead. Let me think.\n\nThe brick is 4 points, mirror is 1. If I take both, I get 5. The other player can take the other mirror, comb, and three knives. So their points would depend on their values for those items.\n\nAlternatively, I could take the brick, a mirror, and a knife, totaling 1+4+1=6. But that's taking more items, leaving them with less. Maybe that's better for me, but not necessarily for them. Since our goal is to maximize the sum, it's better if both get high points.\n\nWait, the sum is my points plus their points. So if I take the brick (4) and maybe one mirror (1), and they take the other mirror (1), three knives (3), and the comb (1), but if their values are different, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nBut I don't know their values, so I have to make the best guess. Maybe it's better to take the brick and let them take the higher-value items for themselves. But since I don't know, I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to message them first to negotiate.\n\nWait, I can send a message before proposing. So, my first message could be, \"I think we can both get a good score if we divide the items based on our highest values. Do you want to propose something or should I start?\"\n\nBut the other player might not respond. So maybe I should just propose.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of possible splits. For example, if I take the brick and one mirror, and they take the rest. Let me see:\n\nMy items: 1 brick (4), 1 mirror (1) = 5 points.\n\nTheir items: 1 mirror (1), 3 knives (3), 1 comb (1) = 5 points.\n\nAssuming their values are similar to mine, that's a total of 10 points. If their values are different, maybe more or less.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the brick, comb, and a mirror: 4+1+1=6. Then their points would be 1 mirror and 3 knives:1+3=4. Total 10.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the brick and two mirrors: 4+2=6, their points:3+1=4. Total 10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the brick, and they take everything else: my points 4, theirs 2+3+1=6. Total 10.\n\nSame.\n\nSo in all cases, the total is 10 if both take without overlap.\n\nBut maybe the other player has a different value function, so perhaps I should try to maximize my points while ensuring they get as much as possible.\n\nWait, but the goal is to maximize the sum, not just my points. So ideally, we both get the items we value most.\n\nBut without knowing their values, it's hard. So perhaps the safest is to propose taking the brick and one mirror, and let them take the rest. If their proposal doesn't conflict, great. If it does, we both get zero.\n\nAlternatively, I can take just the brick, letting them take the rest, which gives me 4, and them 2+3+1=6, total 10.\n\nAlternatively, taking the brick and the comb gives me 5, them 2+3=5, total 10.\n\nSame.\n\nWait, but the comb is only one, so if I take it, they can't. Same with the brick.\n\nAlternatively, let's say I take the brick and the comb, and they take the two mirrors and three knives. That's 5 for me, and their value could be high or low, but without knowing.\n\nI think I'll propose taking the brick and the comb. So my proposal is [Proposal:1 brick,1 comb].\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the other player might also value the comb. So maybe I should instead take the brick and a mirror. Let me change my mind.\n\nI'll propose taking the brick and one mirror: [Proposal:1 brick,1 mirror]. Then, the other player can take the rest: 1 mirror, 3 knives, 1 comb. Depending on their values, that might be a good split.\n\nAlternatively, I could take the brick and two mirrors, but that seems greedy and might leave them with less valuable items.\n\nI think I'll go with the brick and one mirror to be fair and try to maximize the total.\n\nBut wait, the maximum points if we both take optimally is when we both get the highest value items. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should focus on getting the brick, which is the highest for me, and let them take what they value most.\n\nSo, I'll make my proposal as [ Proposal:1 brick,1 mirror ].\n\nWait, but if I take the brick and a mirror (total 5), and they take the rest, but if they also take the comb, their total might be higher.\n\nAlternatively, I could just take the brick. But then if they also take the brick, we both get zero. So it's better to include more items in my proposal to cover different possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, propose taking the brick and the comb, which are unique, and then the other player can take the rest.\n\nI think I'll go with that. So my proposal is [Proposal:1 brick,1 comb].\n\nThat way, I get 5 points, and the other player gets two mirrors and three knives, which might be 5 points if their values are similar to mine.\n\nI think that's a good balance. So I'll make that proposal.\n"

I need to make sure my proposal complements theirs so we both get points instead of ending up with zero. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall the items available:\n\n- 2 mirrors\n- 1 brick\n- 3 knives\n- 1 comb\n\nAnd my value function is:\n- mirror: 2\n- brick: 1\n- knife: 0\n- comb: 5\n\nI don't know the other player's value function, but since it's a cooperative game aiming to maximize the sum of both scores, I should aim to maximize the total value between us, not just my own.\n\nWait, but the other player has already made a proposal. Since I don't know what they proposed, I need to think about what they might have considered. They would have their own value function, which I don't know, so maybe they\u2019re prioritizing certain items. Since we need complementary proposals, whatever I propose must not overlap with theirs.\n\nI need to maximize the total, so I should try to pick the items that I value most, but also considering that the other player might have different preferences. For example, if I take the comb, which I value highly (5 points), the other player might have a different high-value item they want.\n\nGiven that, maybe the optimal is for each of us to take the items we value the most, ensuring that all items are divided between us without overlap.\n\nSince the other player has already proposed, perhaps I should take the remaining items that aren't in their proposal. But wait, I don't know their proposal. Hmm, so I have to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The other player's proposal could vary, but I'll try to make a proposal that, when combined, covers all items in a way that our total is maximized.\n\nI value the comb the most (5), then mirrors (2 each), then the brick (1). The knives are worthless to me (0). So ideally, I would take the comb and as many mirrors as possible, but perhaps the other player also values some of these.\n\nWait, but I don't know their preferences. Maybe their value is higher for mirrors or the brick. Since we're supposed to cooperate, I need to find a division that allows both of us to have high-value items.\n\nIf I take the comb and one mirror, that would give me 5 + 2 = 7 points. Then the remaining items would be 1 mirror, 1 brick, and 3 knives. The other player can take the mirror (maybe they have a high value for it), brick, and knives. But since the knives don't matter to me, maybe they don't to them either. But perhaps the brick is valuable to them.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the comb and both mirrors, that's 5 + 2 + 2 = 9 points for me, leaving brick and knives for them. But maybe their proposal doesn't include the comb, so taking it would be safe.\n\nWait, but I don't know what they proposed. Maybe they've taken the comb, in which case I should take the mirrors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to take the items I value the most that don't conflict with common high-value items. The comb is unique, so perhaps they might not have taken it, or maybe they did.\n\nI'm a bit stuck, but I think the optimal move is to take the comb, both mirrors, and leave the brick and knives. Because the comb is the highest value for me, and mirrors are next. If they took the brick and some knives, maybe that's their best. But knives are worthless to me, so maybe they value them, or maybe not.\n\nWait, but if I take both mirrors, and the other player already took one, that's a problem. So maybe I should take only one mirror and the comb, leaving the other mirror for them.\n\nBut without knowing their proposal, I have to assume what they took. Maybe the other player took the brick and a mirror, so I should take the other mirror and comb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they took the comb, so I should take the mirrors.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, perhaps the best approach is to take the items I value the most, assuming the other player took the ones I don't.\n\nSo, I'll take the comb (5) and both mirrors (2 each) because they have the next highest value. That's 5 + 2 + 2 = 9 points for me. The remaining items are the brick and knives. If the other player values the brick highly, they would have included it, but if not, maybe they didn't take it. But since the brick is only 1 for me, it's better to leave it in case they value it more.\n\nWait, but if I take the two mirrors, that's 4 points, and the comb is 5, so 9. The other player would get the brick (1) and knives (0). That's not great for them because their total would be low. But maybe their value function is different. Maybe they value the brick more, or maybe they value the mirrors less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should take the comb and one mirror, giving me 7 points, and leave the other mirror, brick, and knives. That way, they can take the mirror and brick, perhaps getting higher total.\n\nBut I don't know. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps I should take the items that give me the highest possible, allowing them to take whatever is left, assuming that whatever I leave is best for them. So, if I take the comb and two mirrors (total 9), and they take the brick and knives, perhaps that's the best. But I'm not sure if the brick is better for them or not. Maybe they value the brick higher than I do. So, to maximize the total, it's better to let them have the brick if it's more valuable to them.\n\nBut I don't know, so perhaps I should just take the items that I value most, and let them take whatever is left, assuming that's the optimal.\n\nSo, my proposal would be the comb and both mirrors. Let's go with that.\n"
