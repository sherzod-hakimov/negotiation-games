        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to divide these items with the other player. Let&#x27;s see, we have 2 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. My value function is chalk:4, shoe:1, fruit:0. That means I really value chalk a lot, shoes a little, and fruits not at all.<br/><br/>Hmm, since the goal is to maximize both our scores, I need to think about what the other player might value. I don&#x27;t know their values, but maybe I can infer something or propose something fair.<br/><br/>If I take both chalks, that gives me 8 points. But maybe the other player also values chalks highly. If I take both, and they take the rest, I get 8, but maybe they get 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If their values are, say, higher for shoes or fruits, I might be limiting their score, which would lower our total combined score.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take one chalk and leave one for them. That way, I get 4, and if they also value chalk, they get 4 too. Then we can split the shoes. Since I value shoes at 1 each, maybe giving me one shoe would be better because the other player might have a higher value for shoes. But maybe they don&#x27;t. Wait, but my goal isn&#x27;t just to maximize my own score, but both of ours combined.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps a fair split would be best to ensure both get some value. Let&#x27;s see, if I take 1 chalk and 1 shoe, that gives me 4+1=5. Then they can take the remaining 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. But if their chalk is high, that&#x27;s good for them, but if they don&#x27;t value chalk, then maybe they get less.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should propose something that allows both of us to get the items we value most. Since I value chalk more, I could take both chalks, giving me 8, and they get both shoes and fruits. But if shoes and fruits are their high-value items, that might maximize their score, so total would be 8 plus whatever they get from shoes and fruits.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take one chalk, that&#x27;s 4 for me, and they can take the other chalk if they value it. Then we split shoes. Let&#x27;s say we each take one shoe. That would give me 1, and them 1 (if they value shoes). Then fruits, which I don&#x27;t care about, so they can have both. If they don&#x27;t value fruits either, then maybe it&#x27;s better to just take the chalk and let them have shoes and fruits.<br/><br/>Wait, but since fruits are worth 0 to me, I don&#x27;t mind giving them up. Shoes are only worth 1, so it&#x27;s better to keep them if possible, but maybe letting them have shoes would be better if that&#x27;s their high-value item.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best proposal is for me to take both chalks and one shoe, and they take the rest. That way, I get 4+4+1=9. But no, wait, the quantities are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So if I take both chalks, that&#x27;s 8, then one shoe (1) and one fruit (0), but I can&#x27;t take more than the available items. Wait, no, the total I can propose is up to the available numbers. So I can propose [Proposal: 2 chalk, 2 shoes], but that&#x27;s too much because there&#x27;s only 2 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. Wait, no, each item has 2, so I can take up to 2 of each type.<br/><br/>Wait, the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...], so I have to specify each item type I&#x27;m taking. So if I take 2 chalks, 0 shoes, 0 fruits, that&#x27;s [Proposal: 2 chalk]. Then the other player can take the rest.<br/><br/>But if I do that, I&#x27;m assuming that the other player will accept because that leaves them with 2 shoes and 2 fruits, which if they value those higher, that&#x27;s good. But if they also value chalk, maybe not. But since I can send messages, maybe I should negotiate.<br/><br/>Wait, I can send up to 5 messages before making a proposal. So I should probably start by sending a message.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll start by asking the other player what they think a fair split would be, or perhaps suggest a split and see if they agree. So I&#x27;ll message: &quot;How about we split the chalks and shoes. I take 1 chalk and 1 shoe, you take the rest.&quot;<br/><br/>But wait, since the system says that any messages except the proposal are directly transmitted, and I shouldn&#x27;t use square brackets unless it&#x27;s the proposal. So I should make sure my messages are normal text.<br/><br/>Let me think again.<br/><br/>I want to maximize both our scores. Since my value for chalk is 4, which is higher than shoes (1), I should aim to get as many chalks as possible, but also consider what the other player wants.<br/><br/>If I take both chalks, that&#x27;s 8 points for me. Then the other player can take the 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If the other player values shoes or fruits higher than chalk, this could be good for both. But if they also value chalk, they might prefer getting at least one chalk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, taking 1 chalk and letting them take 1 chalk might be better if they value chalk. Then we can split the shoes. Let&#x27;s say we each take 1 shoe, which gives me 1 point, and they get 1 shoe. Then fruits, which I don&#x27;t care about, can go to them.<br/><br/>So total for me: 4 (chalk) +1 (shoe) =5. For them: 4 (if they value chalk 4) +1 (shoe) + whatever fruits are worth to them. If fruits are 0 for them too, their total is 5. But if fruits are valuable to them, their total would be higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take both chalks, my score is 8, and theirs could be higher if they value shoes and fruits more.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to offer to take both chalks and let them have the rest. That way, I maximize my score, and if they value shoes and fruits more, their score is also high.<br/><br/>But maybe I should check if they&#x27;re okay with that. So I can send a message like, &quot;I propose I take both chalks, and you take the shoes and fruits. Is that acceptable?&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, we both get good scores. If not, we might have to negotiate further.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe they would prefer a different split. Perhaps I should see how they respond.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the actual game, I might not get a response because it&#x27;s turn-based. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to just propose the split that maximizes both our potential scores.<br/><br/>So considering that, I&#x27;ll propose to take both chalks and one shoe, and let them take the rest. That way, I get 8+1=9, and they get 1 shoe and 2 fruits, which could be good for them if they value shoes slightly.<br/><br/>Wait, no, I can&#x27;t take 2 chalks and 1 shoe because that&#x27;s within the item limits. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Total items: 2 chalk, 2 shoes, 2 fruits.<br/><br/>My proposal: 2 chalk, 1 shoe.<br/><br/>That leaves them with 1 shoe and 2 fruits.<br/><br/>That way, I get 4*2 +1*1=9, and they get 1 shoe (assuming their value is 1) and 2 fruits (if their value is higher, say 3 each, they get 6, making their total 7, making overall 16. If they don&#x27;t value fruits, they get 1, so total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 chalks and 0 shoes, they get 2 shoes. So I get 8, they get 2 shoes (if they value shoes at 1, that&#x27;s 2, but maybe they value shoes higher, say 3 each, so they get 6, making total 14.<br/><br/>Wait, since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make the best assumption. Taking both chalks seems better for me, but I want to ensure they get a good score too.<br/><br/>I think the fairest split would be I take both chalks, they take both shoes, and we ignore fruits since I don&#x27;t value them. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 chalk].<br/><br/>Alternatively, to be safe, I can take 2 chalks and 1 shoe, but that might leave them with only 1 shoe, which if they value shoes more, might not be optimal.<br/><br/>I think the optimal proposal is [Proposal: 2 chalk], giving me 8 points. They can take the rest: 2 shoes and 2 fruits, which could be worth more to them. So that should maximize the total score.<br/><br/>Wait, but the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object&gt;, ...], so I have to write it correctly.<br/><br/>Yes, I&#x27;ll make the proposal as &quot;[Proposal: 2 chalk]&quot;.<br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s the best I can do to maximize both our scores because it allows me to get the items I value most while letting them have the rest, which they might value higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 1 chalk and 1 shoe, that&#x27;s 5 points for me, and they get 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. If their value for chalk is high, they get 4+1+0=5, making total 10. But if I take both chalks, they might get 2+2+0=4, making total 12, which is better if their shoes are valued at 2 each. Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Hmm.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to take the items I value most and let them have the rest, so I&#x27;ll propose 2 chalks.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s try to figure this out. So, I&#x27;m playing this negotiation game where I have to split some items with another player. The goal is to come up with a proposal that maximizes both of our scores. The items available are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. <br/><br/>First, I need to look at my own value function to understand what&#x27;s most important to me. I value chalk at 2 points each, shoes at 0, and fruits at 3 each. That means fruits are super valuable to me, then chalk, and shoes are worthless. So ideally, I&#x27;d want as many fruits as possible.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know what the other player&#x27;s value function is. That&#x27;s the tricky part. If I could guess, maybe they have different preferences. For example, maybe they value shoes more than I do, or perhaps they also like fruits. Since the messages can be sent up to 5 times, but the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, so I might not have any messages from them yet.<br/><br/>Wait, no, actually, the other player has already proposed, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So I need to respond to their proposal. But I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. Hmm, that complicates things a bit. Since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t see it yet, but my proposal needs to be complementary, meaning together we can&#x27;t take more than what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>Wait, the set is 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So in total, for each category, no more than 2 can be taken by both of us. So if the other player proposed, say, 2 chalks, then I can take 0, or maybe 1, depending on their allocation.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, I have to decide what to submit. Since I want to maximize both our scores, perhaps I should focus on taking the items that are high value for me but maybe low value for them.<br/><br/>Given that I value fruits the most, taking both fruits would give me 6 points. But maybe the other player also wants fruits. If I take 2 fruits, and they also take 2, that&#x27;s 4 fruits, but there are only 2. So that&#x27;s impossible. So I need to balance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take all the fruits, and give the other player the chalk and shoes. But if the other player values chalk or shoes highly, that might be good for them. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s think about possible scenarios. Since I have to propose without knowing their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to complement theirs. So I should focus on the items I value most, but not overstepping.<br/><br/>I value fruits highest, so I should aim to get as many as possible. Let&#x27;s try taking 2 fruits. Then, maybe for the other items, I don&#x27;t care much about shoes, so I can take 0, but chalks are worth 2 each, so maybe I can take 1 chalk.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take 2 fruits and 1 chalk, that&#x27;s 3 items. Let me check the counts:<br/><br/>- Fruits: 2 available. If I take 2, that&#x27;s fine, since there are exactly 2.<br/><br/>But wait, the total items available are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So each item type has 2. If I take 2 fruits, the other player can&#x27;t take any. But I don&#x27;t know their proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the other player might have also taken some fruits. Let me think. If I take 2 fruits, and the other player also tried to take some, then if the total exceeds 2, both get zero. Since I&#x27;m trying to maximize the sum, I should aim for complementary proposals.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take 1 fruit and 2 chalks, since chalks are next in value. Let me see:<br/><br/>Option 1: [Proposal: 2 fruits, 0 chalks, 0 shoes] → Total value for me: 6.<br/><br/>Option 2: [Proposal: 1 fruit, 2 chalks, 0 shoes] → Total value: 3 + 4 = 7.<br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes 1 fruit, then in Option 1, our total would require 3 fruits, which isn&#x27;t possible. So maybe Option 2 is safer.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know what the other player took. Maybe they took 2 shoes, for example. Then my proposal of 1 fruit and 2 chalks would not interfere because shoes are separate. So that could work.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the optimal is to take 2 fruits and 0 of the others. But if the other player also took some fruits, we&#x27;d both lose. So perhaps taking 1 fruit is a safer bet, allowing the other player to take the second fruit.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take 1 fruit and the other player takes 1 fruit, then for chalks, I could take 2, and the other player might take 0, but that&#x27;s not possible because chalks are 2 available. So if I take 2 chalks, the other player can&#x27;t take any. So perhaps I can do that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values shoes more, so perhaps I can take fruits and chalks, leaving them the shoes. Since shoes are worthless to me, but maybe worth something to them.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s try to outline possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Scenario 1: Other player took 2 shoes and 0 of others. Since shoes are 2 available, that&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>If I propose 2 fruits and 0 chalks, then our total would be 2 fruits for me, 2 shoes for them. That&#x27;s complementary. So my score: 6, their score: depends on their value for shoes.<br/><br/>But if they value shoes highly, that&#x27;s good for both of us.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they took 1 shoe and 1 chalk, then if I take 2 fruits, that would leave 1 chalk and 1 shoe. Maybe their proposal is 1 of each.<br/><br/>But perhaps they have a different allocation. So, to ensure that our total doesn&#x27;t exceed, maybe I should propose taking only 1 of each high-value item.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their proposal yet, so I have to make a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since the objective is to maximize the sum of both scores, perhaps I should focus on getting the items that give me the highest value without conflicting.<br/><br/>I think the safest bet is to take all the fruits, because that&#x27;s the highest value for me, and perhaps the other player doesn&#x27;t value them as much. If they don&#x27;t take any fruits, then I get 6 points. If they took 1 fruit, then there&#x27;s 1 left, so perhaps we can both take 1 each.<br/><br/>Wait, but how? If I propose 2 fruits, and they propose 1 fruit, then the total would be 3 fruits, which is more than available. So both of us get zero. That&#x27;s bad. So I need to ensure that the sum doesn&#x27;t exceed.<br/><br/>Therefore, to prevent that, maybe I should take 1 fruit and 1 chalk, leaving the other fruit and a chalk and 2 shoes for the other player. That way, if they took 1 fruit and 1 chalk as well, we&#x27;d have 2 fruits and 2 chalks, which is okay. But if they took 2 shoes, that&#x27;s also fine.<br/><br/>So maybe my proposal should be 1 fruit and 1 chalk, and 0 shoes.<br/><br/>That way, I get 3 + 2 = 5 points. If they took 1 fruit and 1 chalk as well, our total would be 2 fruits and 2 chalks, which is exactly the available amount. Then our total points would be me: 5, them: depending on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they took 2 shoes, I get 5, they get their value for 2 shoes, which is hopefully good for them.<br/><br/>But wait, perhaps they have a different value function. For example, maybe they value chalk highly. So if I take 1 chalk and 1 fruit, and they took 1 chalk and 1 fruit, that would be fine. But if I take 1 chalk and 1 fruit, and they took 2 chalks, then my proposal would conflict because I took 1 chalk and they took 2, total 3 chalks, which is more than available. So that&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>So perhaps taking only 1 chalk is risky if they took 2.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take 2 chalks and 0 fruits, but that would give me 4 points, which is worse than taking 1 fruit and 1 chalk (5 points). But maybe that&#x27;s a safer approach because there&#x27;s less chance of overlap.<br/><br/>Wait, taking 2 chalks and 0 fruits would mean I get 4 points. The other player could take up to 2 fruits and 2 shoes, but that&#x27;s 4 items. So if they took 2 fruits, that would be 6 points for them, totaling 4 + 6 = 10. Alternatively, if they took 2 shoes, they&#x27;d get 0, which is bad for them, but since they have a value function, maybe they have some value for shoes.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 chalks, and they take 2 fruits, that&#x27;s perfect because we don&#x27;t overlap. So I get 4, they get 6, total 10. But if the other player took 1 chalk and something else, then my 2 chalks would exceed.<br/><br/>Wait, the available chalks are only 2, so if I take 2, they can&#x27;t take any. So if they proposed 0 chalks, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they proposed 1 chalk, we would have 3, which is over, so both get zero. That&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>Therefore, to avoid that risk, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t take 2 chalks because I don&#x27;t know if the other player took 1.<br/><br/>Hmm, this is tricky. I need to balance between getting high value for myself while not overlapping with the other player&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to take all the fruits and leave the rest. So I take 2 fruits, which gives me 6 points. If the other player took any fruits, we&#x27;d both get zero, which is bad. But if they didn&#x27;t take any, I get 6, which is great. Maybe that&#x27;s the best move because it&#x27;s the highest possible value for me, and if they didn&#x27;t take any, we both benefit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player took 1 fruit, then both get zero, but maybe they didn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s a risk worth taking.<br/><br/>So I think I&#x27;ll go with taking 2 fruits and 0 of the others. The proposal would be [Proposal: 2 fruits]. That way, if the other player didn&#x27;t take any fruits, we&#x27;re good. If they did, we both lose.<br/><br/>But wait, I might be overcomplicating. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s better to take what&#x27;s most valuable to me while minimizing the chance of overlap.<br/><br/>Another approach is to take 1 fruit and 1 chalk, which is 5 points, and leave the rest. That way, even if they took 1 fruit, we&#x27;d have total 2, which is okay. If they took 1 chalk, same thing.<br/><br/>Wait, let me check:<br/><br/>If I take 1 fruit and 1 chalk, then the other player could take 1 fruit and 1 chalk as well, which sums to 2 of each, which is exactly the available amount. That works.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they took 2 fruits and 0 chalks, then I have 1 fruit, they have 2, total 3, which is over. So both get zero. That&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>So again, it&#x27;s risky. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take 1 fruit, 0 chalk, and 0 shoes. That&#x27;s 3 points. But that&#x27;s lower than other options.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s list all possible scenarios:<br/><br/>My proposal options:<br/><br/>1. 2 fruits: Risk of overlap if they took 1 or 2 fruits. If they took 0, I get 6. If they took 1, we both get 0. If they took 2, same.<br/><br/>2. 1 fruit, 1 chalk: If they took 1 fruit, okay, total 2. If they took more, we lose. If they took 2 chalks, I took 1, total 3 chalks, which is over, so both get 0.<br/><br/>3. 2 chalks: If they took 0 chalks, I get 4. If they took 1, we have 3, which is over. If they took 2, same as me, we have 4, over.<br/><br/>Wait, no, total chalks are 2. If I take 2, and they take any, it&#x27;s over. So taking 2 chalks is only safe if they take 0.<br/><br/>Similarly for other items.<br/><br/>Given that, perhaps the safest is to take 1 fruit and 1 chalk, which gives me 5 points, and if the other player took 1 of each, we&#x27;re good. Otherwise, we might get zero, but it&#x27;s a balanced approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values shoes, so taking 0 shoes and focusing on fruits and chalks might be better.<br/><br/>Wait, let me think about possible other player&#x27;s value functions. Since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make an assumption. Maybe they value shoes highly since they&#x27;re worthless to me, but I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>In the worst case, if they have a similar value function to me, valuing fruits more, then we both might want fruits, leading to conflict. So to avoid that, I should perhaps take 1 fruit and 1 chalk, or 2 chalks.<br/><br/>But if I take 2 chalks, that&#x27;s 4 points, but if the other player took 2 fruits, that&#x27;s 6 for them, totaling 10. Which is good for both. But if the other player took 1 chalk, then I took 2, which is 3, which is over.<br/><br/>This is so uncertain. I think I&#x27;ll go with 1 fruit and 1 chalk, which gives me 5 points and allows the other player to take the remaining items without conflict, as long as they don&#x27;t take more than 1 of each.<br/><br/>So my proposal is [Proposal: 1 fruit, 1 chalk].<br/></p>
