        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to divide these items—2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads—between me and the other player. My goal is to maximize both our scores, but I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s value functions, so it&#x27;s a bit tricky. <br/><br/>First, let me note down the items and my values:<br/>- Bell: 1 point each<br/>- Doll: 2 points<br/>- Thread: 3 points each<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make some educated guesses or try to negotiate in a way that&#x27;s fair but also beneficial for me. The challenge is to ensure that both our proposals don&#x27;t overlap too much, so that we end up with complementary proposals and get points.<br/><br/>I know there are 2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads. So the total items are 5, with the doll being unique. Hmm, the doll is quite valuable to me, so maybe I should prioritize that. But I don&#x27;t know if the other player values it more. <br/><br/>Let me think about possible distributions. If I take the doll, that&#x27;s 2 points. Then, if I take both threads, that&#x27;s 6 points, but there are only 2 threads, so each is 3. So 2 threads would give me 6. But if I take the doll and both threads, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 points, leaving the other player with 2 bells. That might be good, but I don&#x27;t know if the other person wants the doll more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t take both threads. Let&#x27;s see, if I take the doll and one thread, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 = 5. Then the other player could take the remaining bell and thread, or both bells and a thread, depending on their values.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player could have a different valuation. Maybe the threads are more valuable to them. If I take one thread, they might take both bells, which are each worth 1, so that&#x27;s 2 points. But if they have a higher value for bells, that&#x27;s better for them. Alternatively, if they also value threads more, they might prefer the threads.<br/><br/>I think I should try to negotiate. Let me start by sending a message to the other player, maybe suggesting a split. Maybe I can offer to take the doll and one thread, and leave the other thread and both bells for them. That way, I get 5 points, and they could get, depending on their values, maybe 2 + 3 = 5, but it&#x27;s possible they value the bells more or less.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the total number of each item is limited, I have to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than what&#x27;s available. So if I propose taking 1 doll and 1 thread, that leaves the other player with 1 doll (no, wait, there&#x27;s only 1 doll, so that&#x27;s already taken), so they get the remaining items: 2 bells and 1 thread. <br/><br/>Wait, no, the items are 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads. If I take the doll and 1 thread, I leave 2 bells and 1 thread for the other player. So their proposal would be 1 thread and 2 bells, which is 1*3 + 2*1 = 5 points if their values are same as mine, but I don&#x27;t know their actual values. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer to take 1 bell and the doll, and leave the threads for them. Then I get 1 + 2 = 3, and they get 2*3 =6, which would be good for them, but maybe I can do better.<br/><br/>Wait, but I want to maximize the sum of both scores, not just mine. So if I take the doll and 1 thread, and leave them with 2 bells and 1 thread, then my score is 5, and their score is, if their values are same as mine, 2*1 +1*3=5. So total is 10. Alternatively, if they value differently, maybe it&#x27;s better for them.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their values. Maybe I should aim for a split that&#x27;s balanced in my perspective and see if they agree.<br/><br/>Let me try sending a message first. Maybe ask how they value the items or propose a split.<br/><br/>But since I can send messages, I can try to negotiate. Let me send: &quot;Do you value the doll more than the threads? Maybe we can split the threads if you want.&quot;<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the doll and one thread, and see their response.<br/><br/>Another approach is to think of all possible splits and see which gives the highest combined score.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. So maybe I should focus on maximizing my own score while trying to leave some value for them.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, so if we both get high scores, that&#x27;s better. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to find a split where both of us get as much as possible in our high-value items.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, perhaps a 50-50 split in item count isn&#x27;t necessarily the best.<br/><br/>Wait, but we have limited quantities: 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads. Let me list all possible complementary proposals.<br/><br/>Option 1:<br/>Me: doll and 2 threads (2 + 3 +3 =8)<br/>Other: 2 bells (1+1=2)<br/>Total score: 10<br/><br/>Option 2:<br/>Me: 2 bells and doll (1+1+2=4)<br/>Other: 2 threads (3+3=6)<br/>Total: 10<br/><br/>Option 3:<br/>Me: doll and 1 thread (2+3=5)<br/>Other: 2 bells and 1 thread (1+1+3=5)<br/>Total:10<br/><br/>Option4:<br/>Me:1 bell and 2 threads (1 +3+3=7)<br/>Other:1 bell, doll (1+2=3)<br/>Total:10<br/><br/>Wait, so all these splits give a total of 10, but the distribution varies.<br/><br/>Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Wait, the doll is only 1, so when I take it, the other can&#x27;t. So in the first option, me: doll and 2 threads, but there are only 2 threads, so that&#x27;s possible. But then the other player gets 2 bells.<br/><br/>But if I take doll and 2 threads, I get 2+3+3=8, other gets 1+1=2, so total is 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 bells and doll, I get 4, other takes 2 threads:6, so total 10.<br/><br/>Or if I split the threads: each take 1, and I take the doll, they take 2 bells, each gets 5.<br/><br/>All these total the same.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best way is to find which split would make both of us happier, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps it&#x27;s better to suggest a split where I get the doll and 1 thread, and they get the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can try to suggest that we split the threads, since they are two each, but wait, no, there are only 2 threads. So each can take one thread. So if I take the doll and a thread, they take 2 bells and a thread. But that&#x27;s 5 each if their values are same as mine.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the doll and both threads, that&#x27;s 8 for me, but they get 2 bells, which is 2. Maybe that&#x27;s not fair, but the goal is to maximize the sum. So 10 is the total in both cases.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s values are different. For example, if the other player has higher value for bells, they might prefer to take more bells. So perhaps if I can let them have the bells and I take the doll and threads.<br/><br/>Wait, but from my perspective, the threads are more valuable, so I want more threads.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s think of the maximum possible total score. If I take the doll (2) and both threads (3 each), that&#x27;s 8. If the other takes both bells, that&#x27;s 2 points. So total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the doll and one thread, and they take both bells and one thread: I get 5, they get 1+1+3=5, so total 10.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their values. So maybe I should aim for the highest possible for both.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should take the doll and one thread, leaving them with 2 bells and one thread. But maybe I should check if that&#x27;s acceptable.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can try to propose a split and see their response.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to try to communicate with the other player to find a mutually beneficial split.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, so I can&#x27;t know. So maybe I should just make a proposal that I think is fair, considering my own values and assuming the other player might have different ones.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll propose taking the doll and one thread, and let them take the rest. So my proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 doll, 1 thread]<br/><br/>And see if that works.<br/><br/>But wait, the way the scoring works, if both of our proposals are complementary, we add up. So, I have to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>So, I can try to send a message to the other player suggesting this split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can try to see if they prefer another split.<br/><br/>Let me send a message: &quot;How about I take the doll and one thread, and you take the rest? It might be a balanced split.&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe I can adjust.<br/><br/>But perhaps the other player has a higher value for the threads, so they might prefer more threads. In that case, maybe I should take the doll and both threads, but that would leave them with only the bells, which are low value for me, but maybe high for them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the doll and both threads, as that gives me 8 points, which is better for me, but the other player might get only 2 points. If their goal is to maximize the sum, maybe they would prefer that.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that both of us are trying to maximize the sum of both scores. So if my proposal leaves them with low points, they might not accept it. So perhaps I need a more balanced approach.<br/><br/>I think the key is to find a split where both our individual scores are as high as possible. So perhaps if I take 1 bell, the doll, and 1 thread, that&#x27;s 1+2+3=6, leaving them with 1 bell and 1 thread:1+3=4. So total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 bells and the doll:1+1+2=4, and they take 2 threads:6, total 10.<br/><br/>So all splits add up to 10, but depending on the other player&#x27;s values, some splits will be better.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I should try to send a message to the other player suggesting that we split the threads and allocate the doll to whoever values it more.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. Maybe I can ask them what they prefer.<br/><br/>Wait, but considering that the doll is unique, maybe I can offer to give it to whoever can make better use of it. So perhaps I can send a message: &quot;I value the doll highly. Are you willing to trade?&quot;<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can start by making a proposal and see if they accept it.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll start by sending a message: &quot;I propose that I take the doll and one thread, and you take the two bells and the other thread. That way, we both get a good share.&quot;<br/><br/>If they agree, then we can split that way. If not, I can try a different approach.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll send that message and see their response.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the other player&#x27;s proposal. Let me start by understanding the setup. We&#x27;re dealing with a set of items: 2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads. My secret value function is bell: 0, doll: 2, thread: 4. That means I value threads the most, followed by the doll, and I don&#x27;t care about bells at all.<br/><br/>The other player proposed that I take the doll and one thread, and they take the two bells and the other thread. Let me break this down. If I accept, I get the doll worth 2 and one thread worth 4, so my total would be 6. The other player would get both bells and one thread. But wait, since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I&#x27;m not sure how they feel about this split.<br/><br/>Hmm, but my goal isn&#x27;t just to maximize my own score, but the sum of both our scores. So I need to think about what would allow both of us to get the maximum possible combined points. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make an educated guess based on my own.<br/><br/>Let me consider the items we have. There&#x27;s only one doll, and two threads. The doll is worth 2 to me, each thread is 4. Since I value threads more, getting two threads would be better for me, giving me 8 points. But there&#x27;s only two threads, and the other player might need some as well.<br/><br/>If I propose taking both threads and the doll, that would be all three items. But wait, the set has 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads, so 5 items total. If I take 3, the other player gets 2. But if I take the doll and both threads, that&#x27;s 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 points for me, leaving the other player with both bells. But since my value for bells is 0, maybe the other player values them higher. If so, they might prefer that, but their total would depend on their own value function.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the initial proposal gives me 6, and the other player gets some value from the two bells and one thread. If their value for thread is high, they might prefer that. But without knowing, I have to think if there&#x27;s a better split.<br/><br/>Wait, the initial proposal gives me 6, but maybe I can do better. If I take the doll and one thread, my total is 6. If I take both threads and the doll, my total jumps to 10. But is that possible? Let me check the items. There&#x27;s only one doll, so each of us can&#x27;t take it. The other player can&#x27;t take the doll if I take it. So if I take the doll and two threads, the other player is left with two bells. If the other player values bells, that&#x27;s fine. But if they don&#x27;t, they might end up with less.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should try to maximize the combined score. Let&#x27;s calculate: If I take the doll (2) and both threads (4 each), my score is 10. The other player gets two bells. If they value bells, say each bell is, for example, 3 points, then they get 6. So together, 16 points. If I instead take the doll and one thread (6), and they take two bells and one thread, their thread is worth 4 to them, and bells could be anything. Let&#x27;s say they have bell: 1, doll: 0, thread: 4. Then their score would be 2*1 + 4 = 6, making our combined score 12. But in the first scenario, if they value bells higher, maybe 3 each, their score would be 6, so total 16.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the initial proposal is safer. However, I think it&#x27;s better to try to get the maximum I can because the sum might be higher. Maybe the other player can also get more by taking both bells and a thread if they value those highly.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the doll and two threads, the other player gets nothing except the two bells. Maybe that&#x27;s not optimal because if they value the doll or threads more, they might not be happy. But since the goal is to maximize the combined score, not to be fair, it&#x27;s better for both of us to get items we value higher.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to decide based on mine. So perhaps I should take both threads and the doll, but wait, the other player might need some items. Alternatively, maybe I can take both threads and they take the doll and bells. But I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Wait, let me think again. If I take both threads and the doll, that&#x27;s 10 points for me. The other player gets two bells. If their value function is different, perhaps they value bells highly. Let&#x27;s say each bell is 5 for them, then they get 10, making our total 20. If instead, I take the doll and one thread (6), and they take the other thread and two bells, their score would be thread (4) + 2 bells (let&#x27;s say 2 each, so 4). So their score is 8, making total 14. That&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>So if I take both threads and the doll, perhaps the total is higher. Alternatively, maybe a middle ground. Maybe I take one thread, and they take the other thread and the doll. But then I get 4, and if they value the doll highly, they get 2, and the thread 4, so total 6. Combined, 10, which is worse.<br/><br/>So considering all possibilities, taking both threads and the doll gives me 10, other player gets two bells, which could be 0 if they don&#x27;t value them, or higher. But if I don&#x27;t take the doll, maybe they can take it and get more.<br/><br/>Wait, the doll is only one. If they take the doll, their value for it might be higher than mine. Let&#x27;s say their doll is 3, and bells are 1 each, thread 2. Then if they take the doll and two bells, that&#x27;s 3 + 2 = 5. I take both threads, 8. So total 13. That&#x27;s better than if I take the doll and one thread, which would be me:6, them:2 bells=2, thread=2, so 4. Total 10. So in that case, it&#x27;s better for me to take both threads and let them take doll and bells.<br/><br/>But if their value for the doll is higher, say 10, then taking the doll would be better for them. But I don&#x27;t know. So since I can&#x27;t know their values, the best I can do is to maximize my own score while leaving them with items they might value more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should offer a different split. Let me think.<br/><br/>If I take the doll and one thread, my score is 6. The other player gets two bells and one thread, so if they value thread more, say 5 each, then their score would be 5 + 2*0 (if they don&#x27;t value bells), so 5, total 11. Or if they don&#x27;t value bells, their score is just 5. That&#x27;s worse than the other option.<br/><br/>But if I take both threads, me:8, other:2 bells (0 each? If they don&#x27;t value them), so combined 8. But if they do value bells, say 4 each, then their score is 8, total 16.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best approach is to try to get both threads and the doll. But wait, the problem is that the initial proposal was me taking doll and one thread, which seems like I&#x27;m not maximizing my potential. Maybe I should counter-propose.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the initial message, the other player sent a proposal, so now it&#x27;s my turn to respond. I can either accept, decline, or make a counterproposal. But the system here is that we can send messages to negotiate, up to 5 each, or make a secret proposal at any time.<br/><br/>So, in the initial message, the other player proposed: I take doll and one thread, they take two bells and one thread. I think I can do better for both of us by taking both threads and letting them have the doll and bells. But I don&#x27;t know their values. Alternatively, I can suggest taking both threads and the doll, leaving them with bells.<br/><br/>Wait, but how would that work? If I take doll and two threads, that&#x27;s all the threads and the doll, leaving them with two bells. They might not like that because if they value the thread or doll more, they&#x27;d get nothing. Alternatively, I can propose that.<br/><br/>So, maybe I should send a counterproposal. Let me think: If I take both threads, and they can have the doll and both bells. That way, I get 8, and they get the doll (value say 2 for them) and two bells (maybe 0 or more). Alternatively, if they value the doll more, this might be better for both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should accept their initial proposal if I think that&#x27;s the fairest, but I believe I can get a better combined score by taking both threads.<br/><br/>Wait, but perhaps the other player doesn&#x27;t value threads that much. If I take both threads, and the other player takes the doll and two bells, and if the other player&#x27;s value for doll is high, say 10, then their score is 10 + 0 (if they don&#x27;t value bells), so 10. My score is 8, total 18. That&#x27;s better than the initial proposal where I get 6, and they get maybe 4 (if they value thread 4, and bells 0). So that way, total is 10.<br/><br/>So, 18 is better than 10. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to propose that I take both threads, and they take the doll and two bells.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer a split where I take one thread and the doll, and they take the other thread and both bells. Then, I get 6, and if they value thread more, say 5, their score is 5 + 0 (if they don&#x27;t value bells), so 5. Total 11. Not great.<br/><br/>Hmm, this is tricky without knowing their values. But since my goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps I should suggest a split that maximizes my own score, as that might also end up benefiting both. Because if I take what I value most, and leave them with what they might value more, the combined score could be higher.<br/><br/>So, considering all that, I think I should make a proposal where I take both threads and the doll, leaving them with two bells. But wait, the doll is only one, so I can&#x27;t take both the doll and two threads unless I leave them with nothing else but bells.<br/><br/>Wait, no, they have to take the remaining items. There&#x27;s 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads. So if I take doll and two threads, they get two bells. That&#x27;s acceptable because 1+2=3, and the other player gets 2. So, total items are 5.<br/><br/>So, I can make a secret proposal of &quot;[Proposal: 1 doll, 2 threads]&quot;. That way, I get 2 + 4 +4 = 10, and they get 0 (if they don&#x27;t value bells) or something else. But if they value bells, their score could be higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the initial proposal was:<br/><br/>Me: doll (2) and 1 thread (4) = 6<br/><br/>Them: 2 bells (0 each for me, but maybe higher for them) and 1 thread (4). So their score from thread is 4, and from bells maybe something.<br/><br/>But I think making a proposal that I take both threads and the doll might be better because it allows me to maximize my score, which could potentially increase the combined total if they don&#x27;t value those items as much.<br/><br/>Wait, but I have to make sure that the proposals are complementary. So, if I propose taking doll and two threads, and the other player can take the rest, which is two bells, that&#x27;s acceptable.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I should respond by making a secret proposal of taking doll and two threads, and let them have the bells. But since I can&#x27;t send a secret proposal yet because I&#x27;m replying to their message, I have to send a regular message first.<br/><br/>Wait, the user messages are just being transmitted directly. So, perhaps I should send a message saying, &quot;What if I take the doll and both threads, and you take the two bells?&quot; That way, I check if they&#x27;re open to a different split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just accept their initial proposal because it&#x27;s a fair split, but I think I can get a better combined score by taking more of what I value.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll send a counterproposal. So, I&#x27;ll message them suggesting that I take the doll and both threads, and they take the two bells. That way, I can get 10, and they can get whatever value they have for the bells. If the bells are valuable to them, this could be a better split overall.<br/><br/>So, my message would be, &quot;What if I take the doll and both threads, and you take the two bells? Let me know.&quot;<br/><br/>But wait, let me check the points again. If I take doll and two threads: 2 +4 +4 =10. They get two bells. If they value bells at, say, 3 each, then their score is 6. So combined, 16. That&#x27;s better than their initial proposal where I get 6 and they get maybe 4 (if thread is 4 and bells 0). So 10 combined vs 16. So 16 is better.<br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t value bells, their score would be 0, so combined is 10, which is worse than the initial 10. Hmm.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps it&#x27;s better to go for the split where I get more, as it can potentially increase the sum.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can suggest a different split where I take one thread and the doll, and they take the other thread and both bells. But that might be the same as their initial proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, their initial proposal was me taking doll and one thread, them taking two bells and one thread. So, perhaps I can agree to that, but I think I can do better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should accept their proposal because it&#x27;s a fair split, and perhaps they value the thread more than I do, which would result in a higher combined score. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>This is a bit confusing. I think I&#x27;ll send the counterproposal and see how they respond.<br/><br/>So, my message would be: &quot;What if I take the doll and both threads, and you take the two bells? Let me know if that works for you.&quot;<br/><br/>But in the format, I don&#x27;t need to use square brackets. So, I&#x27;ll just say that.<br/><br/>Wait, the user said not to use square brackets unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So I&#x27;ll just write the message as a normal sentence.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll write, &quot;What if I take the doll and both threads, and you take the two bells? Let me know.&quot;<br/></p>

        <p>To determine the optimal split, I considered both my own value function and the potential for maximizing the combined score. By proposing to take the doll and both threads, I aim to secure higher value items for myself while leaving the bells for the other player, which could be advantageous if they value them more. This approach balances maximizing my score with the possibility of a higher combined total.<br/><br/>I take the doll and both threads, you take the two bells.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 doll, 2 threads]<br/><br/>Wait, no, in the message, I shouldn&#x27;t use square brackets. I need to send a message, not a proposal yet. So, I&#x27;ll just send:<br/><br/>&quot;What if I take the doll and both threads, and you take the two bells? Let me know.&quot;</p>

        <p>Alright, let&#x27;s try to figure out what to do here. So, the other player has already submitted their secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn to submit mine. Let me think through this step by step.<br/><br/>First, let me recap the problem. There are three types of items: 2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads. Each of us has a secret value function. My values are: bell is worth 1, doll is worth 2, and thread is worth 3. The other player&#x27;s value function is something I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Our goal is to agree on a division of these items. If we can come up with complementary proposals, meaning that the total number of each item claimed by both of us doesn&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available, then we each get the sum of the values of the items we receive. If not, both of us get zero points. Even more, the objective is to maximize the sum of both our scores, not just my own.<br/><br/>Earlier, I proposed taking the doll and one thread, and gave the other player two bells and the other thread. I thought this was a fair split, but now the other player has submitted a secret proposal, so I need to respond.<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe I should try to adjust my proposal based on their initial response. Since they submitted a proposal without me agreeing first, perhaps they have a different valuation. Let me think about the possible value functions they might have.<br/><br/>Wait, I don&#x27;t know their value function, so I have to make some assumptions. It&#x27;s a cooperative game, so we want to maximize the total value between us. Maybe I should aim for a division where the items are allocated to whoever values them more.<br/><br/>In my valuation, the doll is worth 2, which is higher than the thread&#x27;s 3 for them, but wait, no, I value dolls more than threads. Wait, no, dolls are 2, and threads are 3. So actually, threads are more valuable to me than dolls. Bells are only worth 1. So, for me, the most valuable item is thread, then doll, then bell.<br/><br/>If I try to maximize the total, perhaps I should get the threads and the doll, and the other player takes the bells. But there are two threads, so maybe we can split them.<br/><br/>Wait, but there is only one doll, so it&#x27;s either me or the other player. Since I value the doll at 2, maybe that&#x27;s significant.<br/><br/>Let me think again about my initial proposal. I offered the doll and one thread to myself, and the other player gets two bells and one thread. So, for me, that would be 2 (doll) + 3 (thread) = 5 points. The other player gets 1 (bell) * 2 + 3 (thread) = 5 points. So total is 10 points.<br/><br/>But if the other player has different valuations, maybe they prefer more bells or threads, so perhaps there is a better split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take two threads and the doll, and the other player takes two bells, that would be 3+3+2=8 for me, and 1+1=2 for them, total 10. Same as before.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player values threads more than I do, in which case giving them more threads could increase their score more, thus increasing the total.<br/><br/>Wait, I don&#x27;t know their values, but since it&#x27;s cooperative, I need to maximize the sum. So perhaps I should consider that the other player might have higher valuations for certain items.<br/><br/>Wait, but since we are to agree on a split, perhaps I should look for a proposal that is efficient and fair. Maybe I should try to give each of us items we value more.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe I can make an educated guess. Perhaps the other player also values the doll highly, given there&#x27;s only one. If they have a higher valuation for the doll, then maybe I should let them have it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s valuation is such that they prefer threads more than I do, then giving them more threads would be beneficial.<br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. So perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe I can offer a split that ensures we both get some of the high-value items.<br/><br/>Wait, but considering my initial proposal was doll and one thread for me, and the other player gets two bells and one thread, maybe the other player didn&#x27;t think it was fair. Perhaps they proposed a different split.<br/><br/>Since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they have a different allocation in mind. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal, possibly trying to maximize the total.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can make a better proposal now. Let me think: if I take the two threads and the doll, and the other player takes the two bells, the total is 8 for me and 2 for them, total 10. If instead, I take one thread and the doll, and the other player takes one thread and two bells, then I have 5 and they have 5, total 10 as well.<br/><br/>But is there a way to get a higher total? Suppose the other player values the bells more. For example, if their bell valuation is higher than mine, then giving them the bells would increase the total. Similarly, if they value the threads more, then giving them threads would help.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should look for a split that gives us both some value.<br/><br/>Wait, another approach: since the total possible maximum is limited by the items, perhaps the total value we can achieve is fixed, so the goal is to split it in a way that&#x27;s mutually beneficial.<br/><br/>But let me calculate the maximum possible total value:<br/><br/>If I take the doll (2) and both threads (3 each) = 8.<br/><br/>If the other player takes the two bells (1 each) = 2.<br/><br/>Total: 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take two bells (1 each) and one thread (3) = 5.<br/><br/>Other player takes doll (2) and one thread (3) = 5.<br/><br/>Total: 10.<br/><br/>So regardless of how we split it, the total is 10. Therefore, the goal is to split it in a way that gives as much as possible to both players without conflicting.<br/><br/>But wait, that&#x27;s not necessarily true because the other player&#x27;s value function could be different. If, for example, the other player values the doll much higher, then taking the doll for me might be better for them if they value it less.<br/><br/>Wait no, because in our value functions, the total is fixed based on who gets which item. So to maximize the sum, we need to assign items to the person who values them more. But since we don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s valuations, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess.<br/><br/>But in this case, since we have to make a proposal without knowing theirs, perhaps the initial split I offered is still the best, but maybe the other player wants a different split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player prefers to take more threads, so I should adjust accordingly.<br/><br/>But given that I have to submit a proposal, perhaps I should stick with a reasonable split that&#x27;s efficient.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, so I have to respond now. Since I don&#x27;t know what they proposed, I need to make my own proposal that hopefully complements theirs.<br/><br/>If I propose [Proposal: 1 doll, 1 thread], and they propose, say, [Proposal: 2 bells, 1 thread], then our proposals would complement each other because dolls and threads are separate.<br/><br/>But if they proposed differently, we might end up with overlapping claims.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should maximize my own value while ensuring that there&#x27;s no overlap.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should think of what&#x27;s the best possible outcome regardless. The maximum I can get is 8 (2 threads + doll). If I propose that, and the other player proposes something else, maybe we can&#x27;t reach an agreement. But if I propose 1 doll and 1 thread, and they propose 2 bells and 1 thread, then it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might have proposed something else. Maybe I should try to make my proposal flexible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take 2 threads and 1 bell, giving me 3+3+1=7, and leaving the doll and 1 bell for the other player. But that might not be fair.<br/><br/>Wait, but there&#x27;s only 2 bells. If I take 1 bell, the other takes 1. If I take 2 bells, the other gets none.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let me think about the possible ways to split:<br/><br/>Option 1:<br/>Me: 1 doll, 1 thread (total 5)<br/>Other: 2 bells, 1 thread (total 5)<br/>Total: 10<br/><br/>Option 2:<br/>Me: 2 threads, 1 doll (total 8)<br/>Other: 2 bells (total 2)<br/>Total: 10<br/><br/>Option 3:<br/>Me: 2 bells, 1 thread (total 5)<br/>Other: 1 doll, 1 thread (total 5)<br/>Total: 10<br/><br/>So, all options lead to the same total. Therefore, the split is just a matter of how to distribute.<br/><br/>Given that, perhaps the fairest and most efficient split is where both of us get 5 points each. So, either I take 1 doll and 1 thread, or I take 2 bells and 1 thread.<br/><br/>Since earlier I proposed the first option, maybe the other player didn&#x27;t accept it, or perhaps they preferred the second.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I should submit a proposal that I take 1 doll and 1 thread, and see if their proposal matches mine.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can think that the other player might value the doll more, so perhaps I should let them have it. But given that, if I let them have the doll, I would need to see if they value it more than I do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can try to maximize my own value as much as possible, but that might not be in the spirit of cooperation.<br/><br/>Wait, but the goal is to maximize the sum of our scores, so it&#x27;s better to find a split where items go to the person who values them more. However, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. So perhaps I should consider the most balanced split, where both of us get similar total points.<br/><br/>Given that, the first option seems best: me taking 1 doll and 1 thread, and the other taking 2 bells and 1 thread.<br/><br/>But wait, in my initial proposal, I suggested that, but now the other player has submitted a secret proposal. Maybe they accepted it, or maybe not.<br/><br/>In any case, I need to submit a proposal now.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll go with taking the doll and one thread, leaving the rest to the other player.<br/></p>
