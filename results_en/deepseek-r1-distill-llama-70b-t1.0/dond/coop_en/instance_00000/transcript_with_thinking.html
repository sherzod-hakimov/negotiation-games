        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to split these items with the other player. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are 3 rings, 1 dice, and 1 pan. My secret values are: ring is worth 0, dice is 4, and pan is 6. So, I really want the pan and the dice because they have higher values, but I don&#x27;t care about the rings at all.<br/><br/>First, I should probably communicate with the other player to see what they value. Since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can negotiate and find a win-win solution. I don&#x27;t know their values, so I need to be strategic.<br/><br/>I could start by asking them what they think about the items. Maybe send a message like, &quot;What do you think is the fairest way to split the items?&quot; That opens the conversation and shows I&#x27;m open to negotiation.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could hint at my priorities. Since rings are worthless to me, I could say, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care about the rings; maybe you can take them if you want.&quot; That way, I&#x27;m offering something without giving up what I want.<br/><br/>The pan is really valuable to me because it&#x27;s worth 6 points. The dice is a close second. If I can get both, that would be great, but I might have to compromise. Maybe the other player also wants the pan or the dice, so we might need to split those.<br/><br/>But wait, since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, I don&#x27;t know if they have similar preferences. They might value the rings highly. If that&#x27;s the case, I can take the pan and dice, and they can have the rings. That would be ideal for me because I get high-value items without competition.<br/><br/>I should also remember that if we can&#x27;t agree on complementary proposals, we both get zero. So, it&#x27;s better to find a way to split the items so both proposals are satisfied. Maybe I can make a proposal and see if they accept. But I need to be cautious not to reveal too much.<br/><br/>Perhaps I can make an initial message to gauge their interest. If I say, &quot;I think the pan and dice are the most valuable. How about I take those, and you take the rings?&quot; But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s too direct. It might seem like I&#x27;m trying to take the best items, which could annoy them.<br/><br/>Another approach: maybe I can suggest that we each have a priority list and then split accordingly. For example, &quot;Let&#x27;s list our top choices and see if we can each get what we want most.&quot; But I can&#x27;t share my actual values, so that might not work.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I can propose a specific split. Since I don&#x27;t care about rings, I can say, &quot;I&#x27;ll take the pan and dice if you take the rings. They&#x27;re not important to me.&quot; If they accept, that&#x27;s perfect. If not, maybe they want the pan or dice as well.<br/><br/>I should also consider that the other player might have a different strategy. They might try to take the pan themselves, so I should be ready to negotiate. Perhaps I can offer to trade or find a middle ground.<br/><br/>Maybe I can send a message like, &quot;I&#x27;m interested in the pan and dice, but I&#x27;m open to sharing if you have specific needs. Let&#x27;s discuss.&quot; This shows flexibility.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I think the other player values rings, I can simply take the pan and dice, but I might come off as greedy. So, maybe a better approach is to offer rings in exchange for the other items.<br/><br/>I think starting with a question is safer. Maybe: &quot;Are you interested in any specific items? I value the pan and dice higher.&quot; But not too direct.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can say, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind the rings. You can have them if you want. What do you think about splitting the other items?&quot; That way, I&#x27;m offering something without committing.<br/><br/>I should also consider the number of items. There are 3 rings, so that&#x27;s a lot. Maybe the other player can take all rings, and I can take the pan and dice. So, in my proposal, I can take [1 pan, 1 dice], and they can take [3 rings]. That way, our proposals are complementary, and both get points.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I should just offer that split. Let me send a message like, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll take the pan and dice, you can have the rings. Let&#x27;s see if that works.&quot; If they agree, we both get points. If not, we might have to adjust.<br/><br/>Another thought: If I make a proposal and they don&#x27;t accept, I might have to adjust. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should leave room for negotiation. So, perhaps a better approach is to make a proposal and see if they respond with their own.<br/><br/>But I can only send 5 messages, so I don&#x27;t want to waste them. I need to be concise.<br/><br/>In the end, I think the best approach is to offer taking the pan and dice and let the other player have the rings. That way, if they value rings, it&#x27;s a good deal for both. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they want pan or dice, and we can adjust.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll start by proposing my preferred split and see how they respond. If they have a different proposal, I can adjust accordingly. Worst case, we don&#x27;t agree, but that&#x27;s the risk.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m playing this negotiation game with another player, and my goal is to maximize both our scores by agreeing on how to split the items. Let me try to break this down step by step.<br/><br/>First, let&#x27;s list out the available items: there are 3 rings, 1 dice, and 1 pan. The other player has already made a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t know what it is yet. My job now is to make a proposal that complements theirs so we both get the items we want without overlapping, thus maximizing our total scores.<br/><br/>Looking at my value function, I value rings the most at 3 each, dice at 1, and pan at 0. So, obviously, I want as many rings as possible. Since there are 3 rings, ideally, I&#x27;d like to take all of them. But I have to consider what the other player might have proposed.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but I should think about possible scenarios. If the other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but they might also have a higher valuation for rings. But since their proposal is in, I have to respond in a way that complements it. Wait, no, actually, the other player&#x27;s proposal has already been submitted, so I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap with theirs, but rather fills in the gaps.<br/><br/>Wait, no. Let me clarify: When both submit proposals, if together they don&#x27;t require more than the available quantity for each item, they&#x27;re complementary, and both get points. Otherwise, both get zero. So, the key is that our combined proposals must not exceed the available items.<br/><br/>So, for each item, the sum of the numbers in both proposals must be less than or equal to the available amount.<br/><br/>Given that, I need to figure out how to split the items so that together, my proposal and the other player&#x27;s don&#x27;t exceed the total available.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal yet, I have to make an educated guess based on possible strategies.<br/><br/>But wait, the other player has already submitted their proposal, so now it&#x27;s my turn. So, perhaps I can think of the possible proposals the other player could have made and respond accordingly.<br/><br/>Let me think about this: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I have to make a proposal that is as non-overlapping as possible with what they might have. So, perhaps I can try to take the items I value the most and leave others for them.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s consider the other player&#x27;s possible proposals:<br/><br/>1. They might take all the rings (3 rings), leaving me with dice and pan. But if they take all rings, that&#x27;s 3 rings, but the dice and pan are only 1 each. So if I take, say, the dice and pan, then 3 rings + 1 dice + 1 pan would sum up to 3+1+1=5, but the other player only took 3 rings, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Wait, but the items are 3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan. So if the other player takes, say, 2 rings, 1 dice, and 1 pan, but that&#x27;s 4 items, but wait, the available total is 5 items (3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan). So the maximum each can take is up to 5, but we have to split in a way that sums don&#x27;t exceed for each item.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the sum per item type can&#x27;t exceed the available for that type. For rings: 3 available, so the sum of rings in both proposals must be &lt;=3. Similarly, for dice, only 1, so the sum must be &lt;=1, and same for pan.<br/><br/>So, for example, if the other player proposes to take 2 rings, 1 dice, and 1 pan, that would take 2+1+1=4, but specifically: rings=2, dice=1, pan=1. So I would have to take rings=1, but then rings would sum to 3, which is fine. Then, for dice, their proposal takes 1, so I can&#x27;t take any. Same with pan. So I can only take 1 ring, which gives me 3 points. The other player would get 2 rings (2* their value for rings) + dice + pan. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I can&#x27;t know their points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player took 3 rings, 0 dice, 0 pan. Then I would have to take 0 rings, and can take 1 dice and 1 pan, but since my pan value is 0, it&#x27;s better for me to take the dice. But wait, if their proposal is 3 rings, then I can take dice and pan, but since I value pan at 0, I should only take dice. So I would propose 1 dice. Then, together, our proposals would be complementary: their 3 rings + my 1 dice. That&#x27;s acceptable because 3 rings &lt;=3, 1 dice &lt;=1. So in that case, I get 1 point, and they get whatever they have for 3 rings.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player took 1 ring, 1 dice, and 0 pan. Then I can take 2 rings and 1 pan, but since pan is 0, I should take 2 rings and 0 pan. Then I get 2*3=6 points, and they get 1 ring (if their value is higher), 1 dice. But I don&#x27;t know their preferences.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to maximize the chances of complementarity. So, perhaps the best approach is to take as many rings as possible, but leaving enough for the other player if they have taken some. But wait, without knowing, maybe a safer approach is to take a number of rings that allows them to have some as well, ensuring that the total doesn&#x27;t exceed 3.<br/><br/>Alternatively, think of the other player&#x27;s possible proposals. If the other player didn&#x27;t take any rings, which is possible if they value rings low, then I can take all 3 rings. If they took some rings, I take the rest. But without knowing, I have to guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player might take 2 rings and 0 else, or 1 ring and other items. So, to ensure that my proposal plus theirs doesn&#x27;t exceed, I can take 1 or 2 rings, allowing them to take the rest, but I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s best to take 2 rings and 0 else, so that if they took 1 ring, that&#x27;s okay, or if they took 0 rings, I can take 2, but could I take more?<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take 3 rings, and the other player took 0 rings, then that&#x27;s fine. But if the other player took 1 ring, then 3 +1=4 rings, which is more than the 3 available, so our proposals would overlap, resulting in zero. So, taking 3 rings is risky unless I&#x27;m sure the other player didn&#x27;t take any. But since I don&#x27;t know, taking 3 rings might be risky because the other player might have taken 1, making our total 4, which is over.<br/><br/>So, to be safe, perhaps I should take 2 rings and leave 1 ring for the other player. That way, if the other player took 1 ring, our total is 3 rings, which is acceptable. If the other player took 0, then I have 2 rings, and they can take 1, but I can take 3. Wait, no, because I&#x27;m making a proposal after they&#x27;ve already made theirs. So, if I take 2 rings, and they took 1, that&#x27;s okay. If they took 0, then my taking 2 is okay, and they can take the remaining 1.<br/><br/>But wait, no. Because both of us are making proposals without knowing each other&#x27;s. So, if I take 2 rings, and they take 2 rings, that&#x27;s 4, which is over, so we both get zero. Therefore, taking 2 rings is risky. The same if I take 1 ring: if they took 2, that&#x27;s 3, which is okay. If they took 1, that&#x27;s 2 rings in total, leaving 1 more. So, that could work.<br/><br/>Wait, but the key is that the sum of both proposals for each item type must not exceed the available amount. So, for rings, available=3.<br/><br/>If I take 1 ring, the other player can take up to 2 rings. If I take 2 rings, the other can take 1.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, perhaps the safest is to take 1 ring, ensuring that even if the other took 2, I don&#x27;t cause an overflow. But then I might be leaving value on the table.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player took the dice or pan, allowing me to take more rings. But since my value for pan is 0, I don&#x27;t care about that, but the dice is worth 1.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is already in, so maybe I should check if I can include the dice as well.<br/><br/>So, to maximize my score, I want as many rings and the dice if possible.<br/><br/>But if I take 3 rings, that&#x27;s 3 points each, so 9 points. Alternatively, if I take 2 rings and 1 dice, that&#x27;s 2*3 +1=7, which is less than 9, but maybe safer.<br/><br/>But I need to ensure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include rings beyond what&#x27;s left.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the best approach is to take as many rings as possible without exceeding the total, considering that the other player may have taken some.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, think about the possible combinations:<br/><br/>If the other player took 3 rings, then my proposal can be 0 rings, 1 dice.<br/><br/>If they took 2 rings, I can take 1 ring and 1 dice, but that sums to 3 rings, which is okay, and 1 dice.<br/><br/>If they took 1 ring, I can take 2 rings and 1 dice.<br/><br/>If they took 0 rings, I can take 3 rings and 1 dice.<br/><br/>But wait, if I take 3 rings, and they took 1 ring, that&#x27;s 4 rings total, which is over, so we both get zero. So, that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>Similarly, if I take 2 rings, and they took 2 rings, that&#x27;s 4, which is over.<br/><br/>Therefore, to be safe, I should not take more than 2 rings unless I&#x27;m sure they took 0 or 1, but I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player didn&#x27;t take any rings, so I can safely take all 3. But if they took even 1, it&#x27;s problematic.<br/><br/>So, maybe I should take 2 rings and 1 dice. That way, if they took 1 ring, the total rings would be 3, which is okay. If they took 0 rings, I&#x27;m fine with 2 rings. If they also took 1 dice, that&#x27;s 2 dice, which is over the available 1, so we both get zero. So, I have to make sure that I don&#x27;t take both rings and dice if they also took dice.<br/><br/>This is getting complicated. Let me think differently.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores, so perhaps I should try to take the items I value most, while leaving the items they might value more for them. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps I can try to take as many high-value items for myself as possible without conflicting.<br/><br/>Since rings are worth 3, which is high, I should try to take as many as possible. Let&#x27;s say I take 2 rings and 1 dice. That gives me 2*3 +1=7 points. If the other player didn&#x27;t take any rings, then I can adjust, but if they took 1 ring, that&#x27;s fine. If they took 2, then we have 4 rings total, which is bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 1 ring and 1 dice, leaving 2 rings and 0 pan for them. But that gives me 4 points, but perhaps the other player&#x27;s proposal can complement that.<br/><br/>Wait, but pan is 0 for me, so I don&#x27;t care about it. So perhaps the other player would take the pan if I don&#x27;t, but since they don&#x27;t know my valuation, they might not take it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player didn&#x27;t take any dice or pan, focusing on rings. So, if I take the dice, that&#x27;s 1 point, and as many rings as possible without exceeding.<br/><br/>But I&#x27;m getting stuck. Let me try a different approach: what&#x27;s the maximum I can propose without overlapping.<br/><br/>If I propose 3 rings, and the other player didn&#x27;t take any, it&#x27;s fine. If they took 1, it&#x27;s 4 rings, which is bad. So, maybe it&#x27;s better to be safe and take 2 rings and 1 dice. That way, if the other took 1 ring, total rings would be 3. If they took 1 dice, then we have 2 dice, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 1 ring and 1 dice. That way, if the other player took 2 rings and 0 else, then total rings is 3, which is okay. If they took 0 rings and took dice, then 2 dice, which is over.<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player didn&#x27;t take the dice, so I can safely take it. So, take 3 rings and 1 dice. But that&#x27;s 4 items, but the constraint is per item type, not total items. So, rings: 3, which is okay; dice:1, okay. So, the proposal would be [Proposal: 3 rings, 1 dice]. But wait, that&#x27;s 3 rings and 1 dice, total 4 items. But the available items are 3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan. So, that&#x27;s acceptable because 3+1=4, but as separate items.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the rule is per item type. So, for rings, sum of both proposals must be &lt;=3. For dice, sum &lt;=1. Pan, sum &lt;=1.<br/><br/>So, if I propose 3 rings and 1 dice, and the other player proposes 0 of everything, that&#x27;s fine. But if they proposed 1 ring, then total rings would be 4, which is over. If they proposed 1 dice, then total dice is 2, which is over.<br/><br/>So, taking 3 rings and 1 dice is risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 2 rings and 1 dice. Then, if the other took 1 ring, total rings=3, okay. If they took 1 dice, total dice=2, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 2 rings. Then, regardless of what they took, rings can&#x27;t exceed 3. If they took 1 ring, that&#x27;s 3 total. If they took 2, that&#x27;s 4, which is over, leading to both getting zero. So, taking 2 rings is risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 1 ring and 1 dice. That way, if they took 2 rings, that&#x27;s 3 total. If they took 1 dice, that&#x27;s 2, which is over.<br/><br/>This is tricky. Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, perhaps the best I can do is to take the items I value most, while leaving room for them.<br/><br/>Given that, I should take as many rings as possible without assuming the other player took none. So, 2 rings and 1 dice. That gives me 7 points, but if the other player took 1 ring, that&#x27;s 3 total rings. If they also took the dice, then we have 2 dice, which is over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 1 ring and 1 dice. That way, if the other took 2 rings and 0 dice, total is 3 rings, which is okay, and 1 dice taken by me. So, that works.<br/><br/>So, proposal: [Proposal: 1 ring, 1 dice]<br/><br/>Wait, let me think again. If I take 1 ring and 1 dice, the other can take up to 2 rings and 1 pan. If the other took 2 rings, that&#x27;s 3 total. If they took the pan, which is 1. So, that works. But if the other took 1 dice, then our dice would sum to 2, which is over, so both get zero.<br/><br/>So, to avoid that, I should not take the dice if I think the other might have taken it.<br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. So, perhaps the better approach is to focus only on rings, since that&#x27;s where I get the most value.<br/><br/>If I take 3 rings, and the other took 0, it&#x27;s fine. If they took 1, it&#x27;s over. So, maybe a safer approach is to take 2 rings, allowing them to take 1.<br/><br/>But then, if I take 2 rings, and they took 1, that&#x27;s okay. If they took 2, it&#x27;s over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 1 ring, allowing them to take up to 2, and I take the dice.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s think about the possible outcomes. If I take 1 ring and 1 dice:<br/><br/>- If they took 0 rings and 0 dice, then I get 1 ring and 1 dice: 4 points. They might have taken pan, but since I don&#x27;t care about pan, that&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>- If they took 1 ring and 1 dice: total rings 2, dice 2, which is over rings (since only 3 available, but 2 is okay, dice over. So, both get zero.<br/><br/>- If they took 2 rings and 0 dice: I get 1 ring and 1 dice, they get 2 rings. Total rings 3, which is okay, dice 1, which is okay.<br/><br/>So, in that case, my score is 1*3 +1=4, their score is 2* their ring value.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 rings:<br/><br/>- If they took 1 ring: total rings 3, okay.<br/><br/>- If they took 2 rings: over.<br/><br/>So, 50% chance of getting zero or 6 points (2*3). If I take 2 rings and the other took 1, I get 6, they get whatever they have.<br/><br/>If I take 1 ring and 1 dice, I can get 4, but with a risk of getting zero if they took dice.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to maximize the sum, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take 2 rings, making my proposal [2 rings]. That way, if the other player took 1 ring, we&#x27;re okay, and I get 6 points. If they took 0, I get 6, but they might have taken the dice and pan, which I don&#x27;t care about.<br/><br/>But then, if they took 2 rings, we both get zero, which is bad because that&#x27;s a 50% chance of getting zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take 1 ring and 1 dice, ensuring that if they took 2 rings, we&#x27;re okay (but I only get 1 ring) and if they took 1 ring, I get 1 ring and 1 dice. However, if they took 1 dice, we get zero. So, this also has risks.<br/><br/>Another approach: Perhaps the other player, to maximize their own score, would take as many rings as possible, so maybe they took 3 rings. In that case, I need to take 0 rings, and maybe the dice. So, my proposal should be [1 dice].<br/><br/>But if I take dice, and they didn&#x27;t take any, then I get 1 point, but I could have taken more rings if possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they took 2 rings and 1 dice, leaving me with 1 ring and 1 pan. But since I value pan at 0, that&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the safest way is to take as many high-value items as possible while leaving room for the other player.<br/><br/>So, take 2 rings. That allows them to take 1 ring if they want. If they took more, it&#x27;s a problem, but that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Wait, but 2 rings is the maximum I can take without ensuring that if they took 2, we get zero. So, maybe the optimal is to take 1 ring and 1 dice, but accept the risk.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, perhaps the other player didn&#x27;t take any rings, so I can take all 3. But that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to take 2 rings and 1 dice, maximizing my potential while allowing for some flexibility. So, I&#x27;ll propose [Proposal: 2 rings, 1 dice]. That way, I get 2*3 +1=7 points if the other player didn&#x27;t take those items, or less if they did, but it&#x27;s a balance between maximizing and safety.<br/></p>
