        <p>Alright, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game, and I need to figure out the best way to divide the items to maximize both my score and the other player&#x27;s. Let me start by understanding the setup.<br/><br/>First, the items available are 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer. My secret value function is: statue worth 3 points, nail worth 1 point, and hammer worth 0. So, for me, statues are the most valuable, followed by the nail. The hammer doesn&#x27;t matter at all.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s value function. They could value the items differently. Since it&#x27;s a cooperative game where both of us want to maximize the total score, I need to communicate effectively to figure out a division that works well for both.<br/><br/>I can send up to 5 messages, so I should probably start by trying to get some information from the other player. Maybe I can ask them about their preferences or suggest a possible division.<br/><br/>Hmm, the items are 3 statues, so maybe it&#x27;s possible that the other player also likes statues a lot. But they might also value the nail or hammer more than me. Since I don&#x27;t know, I need to find a way to negotiate a split that allows both of us to get high-value items.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible splits. If I take all 3 statues, that would give me 9 points, but then the other player would only have the nail and hammer. If the nail is valuable to them, maybe that&#x27;s okay, but if the hammer is important, they might not be happy. Alternatively, I could offer them a statue and take the nail. Or maybe split the statues and the other items.<br/><br/>Wait, the hammer is worth 0 to me, so I don&#x27;t care about it. The nail is worth 1, so not a lot, but maybe the other player values it more. They might not, so perhaps I should focus on the statues.<br/><br/>I should try to propose a split that allows both of us to have a good total. Maybe I can take 2 statues and the nail, and let them have 1 statue and the hammer. But if they value the nail more than me, that might not be optimal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take all 3 statues, and leave them with the nail and hammer. If the other player&#x27;s nail and hammer give them a good score, that might be better. But I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case.<br/><br/>Since I can send messages, I should probably ask them what they think. Starting with a question might help. Maybe I&#x27;ll say something like, &quot;How do you think we should split the items?&quot; to get their initial thoughts.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could suggest a split to gauge their reaction. Maybe propose 2 statues for me and 1 for them, along with the nail. But I have to consider that the other player might value the nail more, so perhaps it&#x27;s better to offer them the nail in exchange for statues.<br/><br/>Wait, but the messages are direct, so I need to phrase it clearly. I should avoid using square brackets except for the proposal. So, I can start by asking their opinion or making a suggestion.<br/><br/>Let me think: if I take 2 statues and the nail, that&#x27;s 2*3 +1=7. Then they get 1 statue and hammer, which for them could be worth more if they value the hammer. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a bit tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe 1 statue for me and 2 for them, but I&#x27;d rather have more if possible. But since the goal is to maximize both scores, I should aim for a split that uses the items in the highest value way possible.<br/><br/>Suppose I send a message asking them to propose a split. That way, I can see what they think. But that might not be the best approach because it&#x27;s open-ended, and they might not respond with a clear proposal.<br/><br/>Another approach is to make a specific proposal and see if they accept. Maybe start by suggesting a 2-1 split on statues, with me taking the nail. Let&#x27;s see, that would be for me: [Proposal: 2 statue, 1 nail] and for them: 1 statue, hammer. But I can&#x27;t write that in a message because the proposal has to be in the secret format. So, in the chat, I can say, &quot;How about I take 2 statues and the nail, and you take 1 statue and the hammer?&quot;<br/><br/>Then, if they agree, we can both propose and get points. If they don&#x27;t, perhaps we can adjust. But I don&#x27;t know their value function, so maybe a better approach is to try to maximize the sum, which would mean allocating items to whoever values them more.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe a 2-1 split on statues is a good start, considering I can offer them the hammer, which I don&#x27;t care about, and maybe the nail, which I care slightly about.<br/><br/>Wait, another thought: since I have a higher value for statues, maybe it&#x27;s best that I take as many as possible, and let them have the items I don&#x27;t value. But I have to make sure that the sum of both our scores is maximized. So if the other player values the nail more than I do, it&#x27;s better for them to have it. Since I value the nail at 1, if they value it at 2, for example, it&#x27;s better for them to have it. But I don&#x27;t know, so perhaps I should aim to take what&#x27;s most valuable to me and let them take what&#x27;s more valuable to them.<br/><br/>But without their info, I can only make educated guesses.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 statues (6 points) and the nail (1), that&#x27;s 7 for me, and they get 1 statue (if it&#x27;s worth more than the hammer to them). Or maybe I can take 3 statues and let them have the nail and hammer. But that would leave me with 9 points, and them with whatever the nail and hammer are worth to them. If the nail and hammer are worth, say, 2 and 1, then their total would be 3, making our combined score 12. Alternatively, if I take 2 statues and the nail (7), and they take 1 statue and the hammer (say, 3 + 1 =4), total 11, which is less than 12. So maybe it&#x27;s better to take all 3 statues and let them have the rest.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. If the other player values the nail at 10, and the hammer at 0, then their score would be 10, which with my 9 would be better than any other split. So, perhaps taking the statues and giving them the nail would be better. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should try to give them the items that I don&#x27;t value much but they might, to maximize their score. Let me see.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should offer them the nail and the hammer, taking all the statues, which gives me 9. If they value the nail highly, their score could be higher. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they prefer a statue. It&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Given that, maybe it&#x27;s better to start by proposing a split that maximizes the sum, assuming that I take the items I value most, and let them have the rest. So, I can propose taking 3 statues and let them have the nail and hammer. But I can only make a secret proposal once, but before that, I can message them.<br/><br/>In the messages, I can suggest that I take the 3 statues and they take the other items. Or maybe try to see if they need something else.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can model this. Let&#x27;s consider possible scenarios:<br/><br/>Case 1: Other player values nail &gt; hammer &gt; statue.<br/><br/>In this case, they&#x27;d want the nail. So, the best split would be me taking 3 statues (9) and them taking nail (1 for me, but higher for them) and hammer (0 for me). So, for them, nail is high, so their score would be, say, 10 for nail, 0 for hammer, so total 10. Combined 19.<br/><br/>Case 2: Other player values statues &gt; nail &gt; hammer.<br/><br/>In that case, best split is both take as many statues as possible. I take 3, they take 0, but that&#x27;s not fair. Wait, but we can only split what&#x27;s there. So, 3 statues, so maybe I take 2, they take 1. Then, nail and hammer to whoever values them more. But without knowing, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I take 3 statues, they take nail and hammer. But if they value statues more, this would be bad for them.<br/><br/>Wait, but since each of us can send secret proposals, perhaps the best approach is to try to get as much as possible without conflicting, but considering the sum.<br/><br/>I think the optimal is to take all 3 statues, as they are worth the most to me. The other items are low value to me, so I can let the other player have them. So, perhaps I can send a message saying, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll take all 3 statues, and you can have the nail and hammer. That way, I get the most value, and you get the items I don&#x27;t care about.&quot;<br/><br/>But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the best. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 statues and the nail, leaving them with 1 statue and hammer. But if they value the hammer, maybe that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Wait, but the more I take of what I value, the better. So, perhaps taking all 3 statues and offering them the rest is better because I care a lot about statues, and they might care more about the nail or hammer.<br/><br/>But to be safe, I could send a message suggesting that I take all 3 statues and let them have the nail and hammer. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust.<br/><br/>If they agree, that&#x27;s great. If not, maybe they have a higher value for statues, so I could adjust and offer to give them some.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, I could send a message asking them how they would like to split.<br/><br/>I think the safest approach is to offer a split where I take 3 statues and let them have the nail and hammer. I can send a message like, &quot;How about I take all the statues, and you take the nail and hammer?&quot; If they agree, we both get good scores. If not, maybe they have a different preference.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, I&#x27;m going to propose taking 3 statues, and let them have the nail and hammer. I&#x27;ll send that as a message and see how they respond.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might not see it that way. They might want a statue. So, perhaps I should be more flexible. Maybe I can offer 2 statues, nail, and let them have the rest. But I&#x27;m not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make a secret proposal, but I can only do that once. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to send a message first.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll start by sending a message: &quot;How about I take 2 statues and the nail, and you take 1 statue and the hammer?&quot;<br/><br/>Then, depending on their response, I can adjust my proposal.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;ve just received a message that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn to respond. Hmm, I need to figure out what to propose so that our combined proposals are complementary, meaning we don&#x27;t overlap in the items we&#x27;re asking for. The goal is to maximize both our scores, so I should consider both my own values and also try to infer what the other player&#x27;s values might be, even though they&#x27;re secret.<br/><br/>First, let me recap the items available: 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer. My own value function is statue: 0, nail: 1, hammer: 9. So I really don&#x27;t care about statues, I value the nail slightly, and highly value the hammer. The other player&#x27;s values are secret, but I need to guess based on their proposal.<br/><br/>Since the other player has already submitted a proposal, I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve asked for, but I can assume they might have gone for the higher-value items. Since the hammer is the most valuable to me, maybe they also value it highly. Alternatively, they might not, so I should try to secure it for myself if possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but if the other player proposed first, I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with theirs. So I should only propose items that they didn&#x27;t take. But since their proposal is secret, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>Given that, let me think about possible scenarios:<br/><br/>1. The other player took the hammer. If that&#x27;s the case, I should take the nail and maybe some statues, even though I don&#x27;t value statues, because they&#x27;re the only other items left. But my value for statues is 0, so it&#x27;s better for me to take the nail to get at least some points.<br/><br/>2. The other player took the nail. Then I should try to get the hammer. Since the hammer is worth 9 to me, that&#x27;s a big point gain. Plus, I could take the statues as well, but they don&#x27;t contribute to my score.<br/><br/>3. The other player didn&#x27;t take the hammer or nail, which is unlikely because the hammer is high value. But if they did, then I could take the hammer and nail.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since there are 3 statues, maybe the other player took all 3 statues, but that would be 0 value for me, so I could take the hammer and nail. But if they took statues, that&#x27;s fine because I don&#x27;t value them, so I can take the more valuable items.<br/><br/>But wait, the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, so maybe they value statues highly. If they don&#x27;t have a high value for the hammer, perhaps they took some statues. But it&#x27;s safer for me to assume that the hammer is the most valuable to both of us.<br/><br/>So, to maximize my score, I should aim to get the hammer and nail. But since the other player has already proposed, if they took the hammer, I&#x27;ll settle for the nail and maybe a statue, though statues don&#x27;t add anything.<br/><br/>Wait, but the proposal needs to be complementary. So if the other player proposed, say, the hammer, then I can take the nail and the statues. But I don&#x27;t need the statues, so maybe I can just take the nail to give myself some points and leave the statues for them if they want, but they might not. Alternatively, I can take all 3 statues and the nail, but that would prevent the other player from getting any statues, which might not matter to me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should propose the hammer and see if the other player also didn&#x27;t take it. If both of us propose the hammer, then our proposals aren&#x27;t complementary, and we both get zero. So that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player has already submitted their proposal, so I need to respond based on that. Since I don&#x27;t know what they took, I have to make a proposal that includes items they didn&#x27;t take. So, perhaps I should just go for the hammer and nail, and see.<br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hammer, 1 nail]. If the other player didn&#x27;t take either, great, I get both. If they took the hammer, then I get the nail. If they took the nail, I get the hammer. If they took both, then our proposals conflict, and we both get zero, which is bad.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can only take up to the available quantity. Since there&#x27;s only 1 hammer and 1 nail, if the other player took one of them, I can take the other. If they took both, which is possible, but unlikely, then we conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they took only the hammer, leaving me to take the nail and statues. But since statues are worthless to me, I don&#x27;t need to take them unless I want to block the other player, but since the goal is to maximize both our scores, not to block.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take all 3 statues, that would leave the other player with only the hammer and nail, assuming they didn&#x27;t take any statues. But since I don&#x27;t value statues, it&#x27;s better for me to let them have statues if that allows me to get the hammer or nail.<br/><br/>Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about what the other player&#x27;s possible proposal could be.<br/><br/>If the other player&#x27;s value function is similar to mine, they might have taken the hammer and nail. Or, if their function is different, maybe they took the statues. But I have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>Since I can send a message, but I can&#x27;t see their proposal yet. Wait, no, I have to respond now. Wait, no, the other player has already submitted their proposal, so I have to respond with my own without knowing theirs. Wait, that can&#x27;t be right. Because if both proposals are submitted, then they are revealed at the same time. Wait, no, the other player submitted their proposal, so now it&#x27;s my turn to submit mine, and then they are checked for complementarity.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, so now I have to submit mine in response, and then the system checks if they are complementary.<br/><br/>In that case, I don&#x27;t know what they took, so I have to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to not conflict.<br/><br/>Given that, perhaps the safest approach is to take the items I value most, which are the hammer and nail, and leave the statues to them. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hammer, 1 nail]. This way, if the other player didn&#x27;t take either, I get both. If they took one, I get the other. If they took both, then we conflict, but that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take just the hammer, and leave the nail and statues to them. That way, even if they took the nail, I get the hammer. But if they took the hammer, I get nothing if I only proposed the hammer. No, because I would have only proposed the hammer, so if they took the hammer, their proposal would include it, and mine would too, leading to conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, no, if I propose the hammer and they also propose it, then our proposals are not complementary, so both get zero. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>So, if I propose the hammer and nail, and they also proposed the hammer, then we both get zero. Alternatively, if they proposed the nail, and I also propose the nail, same thing.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should only propose one of them. Since the hammer is worth more to me, I should try to get that. So I&#x27;ll propose just the hammer. If the other player didn&#x27;t take it, I get it. If they did, then I get nothing. Alternatively, I could propose the nail, but the hammer is worth more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could propose both, and if the other player took neither, I get both. If they took one, I get the other. If they took both, we conflict. So it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Given that, I think the best move is to propose both the hammer and the nail. That way, I maximize my potential score if the other player didn&#x27;t take either, which is possible. If they took one, I still get the other. The only bad case is if they took both, in which case we both lose, but that would be a worst-case scenario, but I think the other player would also try to maximize their own score, so they might go for the hammer and nail. However, since both of us are trying to be cooperative, we should aim for a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, but since both of us are trying to maximize the sum of our scores, not just our own, maybe the other player would prefer that we both get items rather than conflict. So maybe the other player proposed the hammer, I can propose the nail, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps they took the hammer, so I can take the nail, and maybe the statues. But again, the statues don&#x27;t add anything to me.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should just take the hammer and nail, and leave the statues. So my proposal is [Proposal: 1 hammer, 1 nail]. If the other player didn&#x27;t take either, great, I get both. If they took one, I get the other. If they took both, we both lose, but that&#x27;s a possibility.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take just the hammer, and leave the nail and statues for the other player. That way, if the other player didn&#x27;t take the hammer, I get it, and they can take the nail and statues. If they took the hammer, I get nothing, which is bad.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to go for the hammer and nail, because they have the highest value for me, and if the other player is also going for one of them, at least I get the other. If they didn&#x27;t take either, I maximize my score.<br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll propose [Proposal: 1 hammer, 1 nail].<br/></p>
