        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to divide these items with the other player. Let&#x27;s see, there are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My values are ruler: 1, egg: 2, battery: 3. The other player&#x27;s values are secret, but I guess I need to negotiate to maximize both our scores.<br/><br/>Hmm, I should start by thinking about what&#x27;s most valuable to me. The battery gives me the highest value, so I really want that. Then eggs are next, and rulers are the least. But I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s priorities. If the battery is as valuable to them as it is to me, they might really want it too. Maybe I should suggest taking the battery and see if they agree.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the battery, maybe they&#x27;ll want more eggs or rulers. Let me calculate the total points if we split the items optimally. The total value I can get is 3 (battery) plus 2*2 (eggs) = 7, but that&#x27;s if I take all the high-value items. But I need to make sure the other player also gets something so that our total is maximized.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the battery, I might need to give them more rulers. Since each ruler is worth 1 to me, maybe I can give them all 3 rulers, but that would be 3 points for them if they value them as much as I do. But if their values are different, like maybe they value eggs more, then giving them eggs might be better.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So I should try to allocate the items in a way that our combined total is as high as possible. Let me think about possible allocations.<br/><br/>If I take the battery (3) and the two eggs (2 each, so 4), that would give me 7. Then the other player gets the 3 rulers, which, if they value each ruler as 1, they get 3. So total is 10. Alternatively, if I give them one egg and take one, maybe that&#x27;s better. Let me see: I take battery (3), one egg (2). They take one egg (2) and all 3 rulers (3), so their total is 5. My total is 5, theirs is 5. Combined 10. Or if they value eggs higher, maybe giving them both eggs is better.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose a split that gives me the highest possible while leaving enough for them. Maybe I can offer to take the battery and one egg, leaving them with one egg and all rulers. That way, if they value eggs more, they might prefer that. Or if they prefer rulers, they can accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe just take the battery and let them have the rest, but that would give me 3, and them 2 eggs and 3 rulers. If they value eggs more, that&#x27;s good for them. But I should think about what&#x27;s fair in terms of maximizing the sum.<br/><br/>Wait, another approach: the total maximum possible sum from all items is my values plus theirs. So if I take items worth 3 (battery) + 2 (egg) =5, they take 2 (egg) +3 (ruler) =5, total 10. Or if I take all, I get 3+4+3=10, but they get 0, which is worse for the total. So the best is to split so that our total is 10.<br/><br/>So maybe I can propose taking the battery and one egg, and let the other take the rest. Let me check the numbers again. I have 3 (battery) +2 (egg) =5, they have 2 (egg) +3 (ruler) =5.<br/><br/>But wait, the set is 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery. So if I take battery and one egg, they get one egg and three rulers. But if they value eggs more, they might prefer that. Alternatively, if I take battery and two eggs, they get three rulers, which is less.<br/><br/>But to maximize our total, giving both eggs to the other player would mean I take 3 (battery) + 0, and they take 4 (eggs) +3 (rulers) =7. Wait, but maybe their values are different.<br/><br/>I think the safest way is to take the battery and offer them the rest. But maybe I should message them and suggest that. Or perhaps propose taking the battery and one egg, and offer them the rest.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can only send messages first, then make a proposal. So maybe I can send a message to them, saying I&#x27;m willing to take the battery and one egg, and they can have the rest. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>But I should also think about the possibility that they might have higher value on eggs or rulers. Maybe I can start by asking what they think is a fair split, but since it&#x27;s a negotiation, perhaps proposing a specific split would be better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could suggest that I take the battery and one egg, and they take the rest. Let me try that.<br/></p>

        <p>To maximize our combined score, I propose I take 1 battery and 1 egg, leaving you with 1 egg and 3 rulers. This way, we both get a good share based on my value function, and it might align with yours as well.<br/><br/>[Proposal: 1 battery, 1 egg]</p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to propose in this negotiation game. Let&#x27;s see, the items available are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My secret values are: ruler is worth 3 points, egg is 0, and battery is 1 point. The other player has already submitted a proposal, so I need to come up with one that, when combined with theirs, we both get some points.<br/><br/>First, I should think about what the other player&#x27;s proposal might look like. Since they have their own secret values, maybe they really like eggs or something. But since we don&#x27;t know, I have to make an educated guess based on the items.<br/><br/>I have to maximize both our scores. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I need to make sure mine complements theirs. Hmm, but wait, how? If I propose something that takes items they don&#x27;t want, then maybe we both get more.<br/><br/>Let me list the items again: 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery. My value for eggs is 0, so I don&#x27;t care about them, but maybe the other player does. Similarly, the battery is only worth 1 to me, but maybe more to them.<br/><br/>If I take all the rulers, that&#x27;s 3 items, each worth 3, so 9 points. But maybe the other player also wants some rulers. Or maybe they prefer the battery. Wait, if I take all rulers and the battery, that&#x27;s 10 points for me, but maybe that would leave nothing for the other player except eggs, but if they don&#x27;t like eggs, that&#x27;s bad. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, but the goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So if I take all the rulers and the battery, I get 10, and the other player gets 2 eggs, which if their value is high, that could be good for them. But if their egg value is 0, then they get nothing. So maybe that&#x27;s not the best.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should give them the battery because I only value it at 1, but if they value it more, they&#x27;d get more points. So maybe I should take the rulers and let them have the battery and the eggs.<br/><br/>Wait, but I have to submit a proposal that is complementary. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, taking the battery and an egg, then my proposal should take the rest.<br/><br/>But I think I should aim to maximize the sum. Since rulers are worth a lot to me, maybe I should take as many as possible. But maybe the other player also wants rulers. Let me think: if I take two rulers and the battery, that&#x27;s 2*3 +1 =7. Then the other player can take 1 ruler and 2 eggs. But if they value the ruler highly, that would be good for both of us.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Alternatively, maybe I should take all the rulers, ensuring I get the most I can, and let them have the battery and eggs. But then, if they have high value for the battery, that&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player has a high value for the battery, so taking it would be better. I&#x27;m a bit stuck.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should check what my total possible maximum is. My maximum would be 3 rulers (9) plus the battery (1) =10. But maybe if the other player takes the battery, and I take the rulers, then my score is 9, and their score is whatever they get from the battery and eggs. But I don&#x27;t know their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take two rulers and the battery (total 7), and let them have one ruler and the eggs. If their ruler value is lower than mine, but maybe their egg value is higher, that could be better. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should make a proposal that includes 2 rulers and the battery, but I&#x27;m not sure. Alternatively, maybe propose 3 rulers and let them have the battery and eggs.<br/><br/>But the goal is to maximize the sum, so perhaps taking all the rulers is better because they are worth a lot, and the other items aren&#x27;t as valuable to me, so the other player can take the rest, which might be more valuable for them.<br/><br/>So maybe I&#x27;ll propose all 3 rulers and let the other player take the battery and eggs.<br/></p>
