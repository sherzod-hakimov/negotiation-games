My goal is to maximize both my score and the other player's score, but I can only send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal early. My value function is bolt:6, picture:4, egg:0, card:0. So, I really care about the bolt and the picture, but the egg and cards don't matter to me at all.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their value functions, I have to make educated guesses based on possible scenarios. Maybe they value different items than I do. For instance, they might prefer the egg or the cards more than the bolt or picture. Alternatively, they might have similar preferences, but I can't assume that.\n\nSince I only care about the bolt and picture, I'd be happy to let them have the egg and the cards if that makes them happy. But I need to check if that's possible. There's only one egg, so that's not a problem, but there are four cards. They might want all the cards, but maybe they don't need four. So, perhaps I can offer the egg and some number of cards in exchange for the bolt and picture.\n\nBut I don't know their preferences, so maybe I should start by asking them what they want. If I can figure out their priorities, I can negotiate a better deal for both of us. So, my first message could be asking them to share their preferences or perhaps propose a split.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to make an initial offer. Since I don't value the egg or cards, I could offer them the egg and all four cards, and ask for the bolt and picture. But I don't know if that works for them. If they value the bolt or picture highly, they might not accept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they don't want all four cards. Maybe having some number of them would be enough. So, if I offer the egg and, say, two cards, and ask for the bolt and picture, would that be acceptable? Or maybe three? I don't know. It depends on their valuation.\n\nAnother approach is to suggest a division where I take what I value most, and they take what they might value. Since I don't care about egg and cards, I can let them have all of those. So, I'd propose taking the bolt and picture, and they take the egg and four cards. But would that maximize both our scores? It would maximize mine because I get 6+4=10 points. But the other player might not be happy if they value the bolt or picture more.\n\nWait, no, because according to the rules, if the proposals are complementary, both get their requested items, but if not, both get zero. So, it's in both our interests to propose something that doesn't overlap. So, if I take bolt and picture (1 each), and they take egg and four cards, that's complementary, and we both get points.\n\nBut if the other player also wants the bolt or picture, they might not agree. So, maybe I can suggest that I take bolt and picture, and they take the rest. But I need to frame it in a way that's appealing to them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can offer to let them take the bolt if they allow me to take the picture, and give them the rest. But I don't know their values. Maybe they don't want the bolt but want something else.\n\nI think the best approach is to offer them the majority of the items they might value in exchange for what I value. So, I'll send a message:\n\n\"Hello, I'm thinking of taking the bolt and picture. If that's acceptable to you, you can have the egg and all four cards. Let me know if that works for you.\"\n\nThat way, I'm offering them the majority of the items, which might be more than they expected, and maybe they'll accept. If not, I can adjust my offer, perhaps offering them some of the cards in exchange for one of the items I want.\n\nWait, but I don't care about the cards or egg, so maybe I can just let them have those. So, by offering them all the cards and the egg, I'm giving them everything else, so they can't really complain, right? But I should make sure that I'm not taking more than is necessary. Maybe they don't need all four cards, but I have to balance it so that both of us get something valuable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to ask them what they want. So, my first message could be: \"What are your priorities? Let's try to split the items in a way that benefits both of us.\" That way, I can get more insight into what they want and adjust my proposal accordingly.\n\nBut maybe it's more strategic to make an initial offer. So, I'll stick with my first idea: offer to take bolt and picture, let them have egg and all four cards.\n\nWait, but if I take two items and they take five (egg + four cards), that seems fair because the items are limited. But the values are based on our secret functions. So, if they have high value for the egg or cards, they'd be happy. If not, maybe they don't care.\n\nI think that's the best starting point. So, I'll send that message. If they accept, great. If not, I'll have to consider their counter-offer or maybe propose an alternative.\n",

                    "content": "Alright, let's try to figure out the best way to respond to the other player's proposal. So, from the initial problem, the items available are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, and 4 cards. My value function is: bolt at 0, picture at 1, egg at 1, and card at 2 each. The other player has already made a proposal, and now it's my turn to propose something that ideally complements theirs so we both get points.\n\nFirst, I remember that both of us want to maximize the sum of our scores. That means we're better off cooperating rather than trying to maximize just our own scores, because if our proposals don't complement each other, we both get zero. So, cooperation is key here.\n\nI should think about what the other player might have proposed. Since I don't know their value functions, I can only guess based on typical strategies. Let's consider the possible allocations and how they might align with both our interests.\n\nThe total items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. So, there are 7 items in total.\n\nLet me first outline the possible items each might want:\n\n- Bolt: I value it at 0, so I don't care about it. The other player might not either, but maybe they do. Without knowing, I can't be sure.\n\n- Picture: I value it at 1. Maybe the other player also values it, or less. Same with the egg.\n\n- Cards: I value each at 2, so having more cards is better for me. Since there are 4 cards, if the other player takes some, that affects my total.\n\nBut without knowing their values, I have to make an educated guess. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nIf the other player took the bolt, picture, and egg, leaving me with all 4 cards, that would be great for me because I value cards the most. My total would be 4*2 = 8, and theirs would be 0 (if they don't value bolt, picture, egg much), but since they proposed it, maybe they do. Wait, no, their values are secret, but I have to consider that they might have higher values for some items.\n\nAlternatively, suppose they took some cards and maybe one other item. Let's say they took 2 cards, which would give them 2*2=4 if their card value is the same, but I don't know.\n\nWait, no\u2014each player's value functions are independent. So I should think about maximizing the total, which would mean allocating items to whoever values them more.\n\nIn my case, I value cards the most (2 each), followed by picture and egg (1 each), and don't care about bolt. So, ideally, I would want as many cards as possible, while the other player might have higher values elsewhere.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn't overlap.\n\nSince I can only propose up to 5 messages, but in this case, it's my proposal after theirs, so I have to respond.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the rules. The other player has already submitted a proposal. Now it's my turn. So I have to submit a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn't exceed the available items.\n\nSo, for example, if they proposed, say, taking the bolt and 3 cards, I could take the remaining picture, egg, and 1 card. But I don't know what they took, so I have to make a proposal that, when combined, doesn't duplicate.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to propose in a way that is likely to complement theirs.\n\nLet me consider what would be the best for me: maximizing my own items, especially cards, while leaving enough for them to have some items too.\n\nGiven that I value cards at 2 each, I probably want as many as possible. So maybe I can take 3 cards, leaving 1 for them. Plus, maybe take the picture and egg, but since I can only take up to the available quantities.\n\nWait, the total items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. So, I need to propose some combination that, added to theirs, doesn't go over.\n\nSuppose I propose taking 3 cards, the picture, and the egg. That would be 3 cards + 1 picture +1 egg. That would leave them with 1 card and the bolt. But I don't know if that's complementary. Maybe they took the bolt and some cards, so if I take the rest, but I have to make sure that our proposals don't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't know their proposal, I can try to take the cards and other items that I value more, hoping that their proposal took different items.\n\nGiven that I can't communicate with them, I have to make a proposal that is as non-overlapping as possible.\n\nAnother approach is to take all the items except those they might have taken. But without knowing, it's tricky.\n\nBut let's think: since I value cards highly, I should aim to take as many as possible. Also, if I can take the picture and egg, which I value at 1 each, that's better than leaving them for the other player, who might value them higher.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal is to take 3 cards, the picture, and the egg. That would leave the bolt and 1 card for the other player. If they took the bolt and 1 card, that works.\n\nAlternatively, if they took the picture and egg, and some cards, then my proposal might overlap.\n\nWait, but since they already made a proposal, I have to respond. So perhaps the best is to take the maximum I want without overlapping.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that, in most cases, would complement.\n\nLet me consider possible proposals:\n\nIf I take all 4 cards, that might leave the other items for them. But if they also took some cards, we would overlap. I don't know, so maybe taking 3 cards and the other items is safer.\n\nWait, but I can't take the same items as them. So perhaps I should propose taking the items I value the most, ensuring that there's some for them.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating. Let's think that the best outcome for both is to allocate the items based on who values them more. Since I don't know their values, but I can assume they might have different preferences.\n\nGiven that, I should maximize my own value without taking items they might need.\n\nBut since the total is 7 items, and I can take any number, the best is to take the highest value items I can, which are the cards.\n\nSo, I'll propose taking 4 cards and the picture and egg. Wait, no, I can't take more than what's available, and I have to make sure that if the other player took some, we don't duplicate.\n\nWait, but in my secret proposal, I can take any items, but if we both take the same item, it's invalid.\n\nSo perhaps, to maximize, I should take all the cards and the other items I can, but if the other player took some, I have to adjust.\n\nBut without knowing, I can't. So perhaps I should take 3 cards, the picture, and the egg. That way, I leave 1 card and the bolt for them.\n\nSo my proposal would be: 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg.\n\nBut I have to format it as [Proposal: number object,...]\n\nSo, [Proposal: 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg], but wait, the items are four cards, one each of the others.\n\nBut wait, the correct way is to list them with numbers. So, 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg, but in the available items, it's 4 cards.\n\nWait, but the available items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. So, if I take 3 cards, the other can take 1 card.\n\nSo, my proposal would be: 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg.\n\nSo, in the required format: \"[Proposal: 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg]\" but I think the correct syntax is to list each item with its count, separated by commas.\n\nWait, the example given was \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\", so I should format each object with its count.\n\nSo, for 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg, it would be:\n\n[Proposal: 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg]\n\nBut I think the correct way is:\n\n[Proposal: 3 card, 1 picture, 1 egg]\n\nWait, no, because \"cards\" is plural, so it's 3 cards.\n\nBut the example used the singular, like \"number object name\", so maybe it's 3 card, 1 picture, 1 egg.\n\nWait no, the example used \"number object name\" as a template, so probably better to use plural if the count is more than one.\n\nBut to follow the example, let me check. The example in the rules was: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\". So, for multiple, it's \"number object name\" each, so 3 cards would be \"3 cards\".\n\nTherefore, [Proposal: 3 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg].\n\nBut wait, in the available items, there's only 1 picture and 1 egg, so if I take them, the other player can't, but if they took them, I can't. So, perhaps I should leave them, but I want to take what's more valuable to me.\n\nAlternatively, take only the cards and let them take the other items.\n\nWait, but I value the picture and egg at 1 each, which is better than the other player getting them if they value them less. But since I don't know, it's a gamble.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum, if I take the items I value more, and they take theirs, the total is higher.\n\nSo, perhaps taking 4 cards, leaving 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg.\n\nBut if the other player took the picture and egg, then my proposal would have 4 cards, but they already took the other items, making our proposals complementary.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure that the sum of both proposals doesn't exceed the available items.\n\nIf I propose 4 cards, and they proposed, say, 1 picture and 1 egg, and maybe 1 bolt, that would work. But if they proposed 4 cards, then we both can't take them.\n\nThis is tricky without knowing their proposal. But perhaps I should take the items I value most, assuming they took the others.\n\nSo, I'll propose taking 4 cards. That way, if they took the bolt, picture, and egg, our proposals are complementary. If they took some cards, then it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, taking 3 cards, 1 picture, and 1 egg, as before.\n\nBut I'm not sure which is better. Since I don't know their proposal, perhaps the safest is to take as much as I can, hoping that they didn't take the same.\n\nWait, but since they might take the cards too, it's a risk. But perhaps the best way is to take 4 cards, because I value them the highest. So, I'll propose that.\n",
