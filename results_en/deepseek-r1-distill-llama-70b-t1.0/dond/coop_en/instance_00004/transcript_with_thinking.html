        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to split these items with the other player. Let&#x27;s see, the items available are 1 thimble, 1 soap, and 4 stamps. My values are thimble: 3, soap:7, stamp:0. That means I really want the soap because it&#x27;s worth 7 points to me, more than the thimble which is only 3, and the stamps are worthless to me. <br/><br/>Hmm, the other player&#x27;s values are secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they want. But I need to maximize both our scores, right? Since if we can&#x27;t agree, we get zero, so it&#x27;s better to find a way to split them so both are happy.<br/><br/>Let me think, I have 5 messages to negotiate. Maybe I can ask what they want. I&#x27;ll start by asking them about their preferences. So, message 1: &quot;What do you want? Do you prefer a specific item?&quot;<br/><br/>Now, I wait for their response. Suppose they reply that they want the thimble. Then I can take the soap and give the stamps to them since stamps don&#x27;t matter to me. But wait, I should consider their possible interest in the stamps. Maybe they have a high value for stamps, and the thimble. Alternatively, maybe they don&#x27;t care about the stamps at all.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player wants the stamps, I could offer them all 4 stamps, keep the soap for myself, and maybe take the thimble as well. But that might not be fair because I don&#x27;t know their values. Since my goal is to maximize the total score, I need to think about how to allocate the items so that both get maximum value.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. So maybe I can propose a split. Let me see, if I suggest that I take the soap because it&#x27;s worth a lot to me, and they can take the thimble and the stamps. That way, I get 7 points, and they get whatever their values are for thimble and stamps. Alternatively, if I let them have the soap and I take the thimble and stamps, but that would give me only 3 points, and maybe the stamps are worth more to them.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I should ask them first. Let&#x27;s say I message them, &quot;Do you want the soap, thimble, or stamps? Let&#x27;s split them so both are happy.&quot; That&#x27;s message 2.<br/><br/>If they respond that they want the thimble and stamps, then I can take the soap. That would be good because I get 7 points, and they get their desired items. But if they don&#x27;t want the thimble, maybe they want the soap, so I have to decide whether to give it up. But giving up the soap would lower my score a lot, so I might not want to do that unless necessary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the stamps are more valuable to them. Since there are 4 stamps, perhaps they can take all the stamps and I take the thimble and soap. But I can&#x27;t take both because that would only leave stamps for them. Wait, but I have 4 stamps, which is a lot, so maybe they want some number of them.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says the set has 1 thimble, 1 soap, 4 stamps. So maybe if I give them the thimble and they take the stamps, or give them the soap.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should offer a proposal. Let me see, if I take the soap and they take the thimble and stamps. But the stamps are 4, which is a lot, perhaps they value each stamp, so getting all 4 would be better for them.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Maybe I should try to negotiate. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I can say, &quot;I value the soap the most. If you take the thimble and the stamps, I&#x27;ll take the soap.&quot; That way, both of us get what we want. So that&#x27;s message 3.<br/><br/>If they agree, great. If not, maybe I can adjust. Alternatively, I could just go ahead and make a proposal after that. But since I can send up to 5 messages, I can try to negotiate first.<br/><br/>So, step by step:<br/><br/>1. Message 1: Ask what they want.<br/>2. Based on their response, adjust my proposal.<br/>3. If they don&#x27;t respond, proceed to offer a split.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the initial problem, the user is me thinking, and the other player is someone I don&#x27;t know. So perhaps I should plan a strategy.<br/><br/>Another thought: Since the stamps are 4, but each stamp is worth 0 to me, if the other player values stamps, they might want as many as possible. So maybe I can offer to give them all the stamps and the thimble, and take the soap. That would give me 7 points, and them whatever their values on thimble and stamps.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t value the thimble, maybe I can give them the stamps and the other items as needed.<br/><br/>Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the thimble is worth 3 to me, but maybe more to them. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to give them the thimble if they value it more, so that they have a higher total.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Maybe I can propose that I take the soap, and they take the thimble and stamps. So, for my proposal, it would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 soap]&quot;. And the other player would have to propose something complementary. But I don&#x27;t know if that will work.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can say that I&#x27;m willing to let them take the thimble and stamps, and I take the soap. So my proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 soap]&quot;, and their proposal would need to take 1 thimble and 4 stamps. That would satisfy all items, so it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t want to give me the soap, perhaps because they want it more, then we might not reach an agreement.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I have to, I might give up the soap, but that would lower my score a lot, so I&#x27;d prefer not to.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should try to message them and see. Let me structure my messages:<br/><br/>1. Message 1: Hi, let&#x27;s talk about how to split the items. What do you think is a fair way?<br/><br/>2. Depending on response, adjust. Suppose they say they want the thimble and stamps, then I take the soap.<br/><br/>3. Then, I can agree and make the proposal.<br/><br/>But I have to consider that without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.<br/><br/>Another approach: Since the stamps are 4, maybe I can offer to let them take all stamps, and then decide on thimble and soap.<br/><br/>Wait, but that might not be efficient because the other player might not value the stamps as much as I do the soap.<br/><br/>Hmm, perhaps I should just make a proposal where I take the soap, they take the rest. That&#x27;s my best move because the soap is worth the most to me, and the stamps are worthless.<br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t accept, we both get zero, which is bad. So maybe I can negotiate first.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can say I&#x27;m willing to take only the soap, and let them have the rest. That way, if they agree, we both gain from it.<br/><br/>Wait, but the thimble is worth 3 to me, so if I take the soap and leave the thimble, I get 7 instead of 3+ whatever. So better for me to take the soap.<br/><br/>I think the best move is to propose that I take the soap, and let them have the thimble and all stamps. So my proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 soap]&quot;, and they would need to propose &quot;[Proposal: 1 thimble,4 stamps]&quot;. Then both get points.<br/><br/>But I have to make sure that I send this as a secret proposal when ready.<br/><br/>So, in the chat, I can negotiate first, like send a message saying I want the soap, and see if they agree. If they agree, we can proceed. Otherwise, maybe adjust.<br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, I have to plan.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can directly make the secret proposal for the soap, but that might not work if they don&#x27;t take the rest.<br/><br/>Wait, but the secret proposal has to be complementary. So if I propose 1 soap, and they propose 1 thimble,4 stamps, then we both get our points. But if they don&#x27;t take the rest, we both get zero.<br/><br/>So maybe it&#x27;s better to negotiate first to ensure that we both are on the same page.<br/><br/>Let me think of possible messages. Maybe:<br/><br/>Message 1: I want the soap. Can you take the thimble and stamps?<br/><br/>If they agree, then proceed. If not, perhaps offer to give them something else.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know their values, so perhaps it&#x27;s better to just take the soap.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player also wants the soap, so I have to see.<br/><br/>Wait, but without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. So the best I can do is try to take the soap, and if they don&#x27;t take the rest, we both lose.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can take the soap and leave the rest, but then the other might take the thimble and stamps, or maybe not.<br/><br/>Wait, but the split has to cover all items, I think, because otherwise, the ones not taken are just left. But according to rule (c), the proposal is about the items you want, so if your proposals together take all items, you get the score; otherwise, they can take some, but if overlapping, you both get zero.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the rule says, &quot;if your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals,&quot; so if we have overlapping, we both get zero, but if each takes non-overlapping items such that all are taken, then we both get points.<br/><br/>So, for example, if I take soap, and they take thimble and stamps, that&#x27;s complementary and we both get points. If I take soap and thimble, and they take thimble and stamps, we overlap on thimble, so we both get zero.<br/><br/>Thus, the key is to have non-overlapping proposals.<br/><br/>So, I can propose 1 soap, and if they propose 1 thimble and 4 stamps, that&#x27;s complementary, so we both get points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, they might propose 1 thimble and 2 stamps, and I have 1 soap and 2 stamps, but that would overlap on stamps. So, no.<br/><br/>So, the idea is to have our proposals cover all items without overlap.<br/><br/>Thus, the optimal is to split the items so that each takes some subset without overlap.<br/><br/>Given that, I can try to negotiate to take the soap, and they take the rest.<br/><br/>So, to do that, I can message them:<br/><br/>Message 1: I think I&#x27;ll take the soap. You can have the thimble and stamps.<br/><br/>Wait, but that&#x27;s a message, not a proposal. Then, when I&#x27;m ready, I can make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 soap]. If they, in their proposal, take 1 thimble and 4 stamps, then it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, I can try to send this suggestion, and then make the proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can just send the proposal directly.<br/><br/>But it&#x27;s risky because if they don&#x27;t take the other items, we both get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can message them and see if they agree to the split.<br/><br/>So, message 1: Do you think it&#x27;s a good idea if I take the soap and you take the thimble and stamps?<br/><br/>If they agree, great. Then I can make the proposal.<br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t respond or disagree, maybe I have to adjust.<br/><br/>Given that, perhaps it&#x27;s better to just make the proposal to take the soap, as that&#x27;s the best for me, and hope they take the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they have a high value for the thimble, they might not want to give me the soap. So perhaps I should consider that.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. So it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble. But given that, I think the best I can do is to take the soap, as it&#x27;s worth the most to me, and offer them the other items.<br/><br/>So, after negotiating, I would make the proposal: [Proposal:1 soap].<br/><br/>But since I need to do this step by step, maybe in the chat I can send:<br/><br/>Message 1: Let me take the soap, and you take the rest.<br/><br/>If they agree, then we&#x27;re good. If not, perhaps I can offer a different split.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I can send multiple messages, I can try to negotiate further.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can offer to take the soap and some stamps, but since stamps are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not beneficial.<br/><br/>Alternatively, take the soap and thimble, but that would leave stamps, which I don&#x27;t care about, but the other player might not want that.<br/><br/>Wait, but that would leave stamps, but if I take two items, soap and thimble, they can take the stamps.<br/><br/>So, my proposal could be [Proposal:1 soap,1 thimble], and they take [4 stamps]. That would satisfy all items, so it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>But then, I get 7+3=10 points, and they get whatever their value is for the stamps. If stamps are valuable to them, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe they don&#x27;t care.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player has a high value for stamps, this would be good.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since the stamps are 4, maybe they have a higher total value than the thimble.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>So, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take the soap, which is worth 7 to me, and let them have the thimble and stamps.<br/><br/>Thus, I can send:<br/><br/>Message 1: Let me take the soap. You can have the thimble and the stamps.<br/><br/>Then, if they agree, I can make the proposal.<br/><br/>If they don&#x27;t, I can adjust.<br/><br/>But to make it more efficient, perhaps I can just make the proposal directly, but with the understanding that they need to take the thimble and stamps.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can think they might also want to take the soap, so I have to convince them to let me have it.<br/><br/>But without knowing, I think the best I can do is to propose taking the soap, and they take the rest.<br/><br/>Thus, my proposal would be:<br/><br/>[Proposal:1 soap]<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that in my messages, I let them know to take the thimble and stamps.<br/><br/>So perhaps:<br/><br/>Message 1: I&#x27;ll take the soap. You take the thimble and the stamps.<br/><br/>Then, make the proposal.<br/><br/>But I have to send the proposal as a separate message, using the format.<br/><br/>So, after the message, I can send the proposal.<br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s the way to go.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m playing this negotiation game with another player, and we have to divide some items. Let me try to figure out the best way to approach this.<br/><br/>First, let&#x27;s see what items are on the table. There&#x27;s 1 thimble, 1 soap, and 4 stamps. My secret value function is: thimble is worth 2 points, soap is 0, and each stamp is also worth 2 points. So, I really value thimbles and stamps but don&#x27;t care about soap at all.<br/><br/>Now, the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. My goal is to maximize both mine and the other player&#x27;s scores because if our proposals are complementary (meaning we&#x27;re not asking for more than what&#x27;s available), we both get points; otherwise, we both get zero. So, cooperation is key here.<br/><br/>I need to think about what the other player might have proposed. Since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to make educated guesses. Maybe they value some items more than others, just like me. Let me consider possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s break down the items:<br/><br/>- Thimble: 1 available. If I take it, I get 2 points. If I leave it, the other player might take it.<br/>- Soap: 1 available. I don&#x27;t care about it, so if the other player wants it, I can let them have it without any loss for me.<br/>- Stamps: 4 available. Each is worth 2 points. They add up quickly, so getting more stamps is better.<br/><br/>I have to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available quantities. So I should aim for a division where both of us get items we value more.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible allocations:<br/><br/>1. If the other player took the thimble, I&#x27;d have to focus on stamps. Since there are 4 stamps, maybe we each take 2, and the other player could take the soap. That way, I get 2 stamps (4 points), and the other player gets 1 thimble (maybe 2 points) and soap (0). So total would be 4 + 2 = 6, which might be a good score.<br/><br/>2. If the other player didn&#x27;t take the thimble, I could take it, and maybe take some stamps. Let&#x27;s say I take the thimble (2 points) and 2 stamps (4 points). That would give me 6 points. The other player could take the remaining 2 stamps (4 points) and the soap (0). So total would be 10 points. That&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the thimble and 2 stamps, that&#x27;s 3 items. The other player would get 2 stamps and soap. That adds up correctly: 1+1+4=6 items total, so that works.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know what the other player proposed. Maybe they took the thimble, or maybe they took some stamps, or maybe the soap.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose a split that ensures I get the maximum I can, while allowing the other player to also get some points, so that our proposals can be complementary.<br/><br/>Let me think: if I propose to take the thimble and 3 stamps, that&#x27;s 4 items. The other player would have to take the soap and 1 stamp. If the other player didn&#x27;t propose that, maybe that&#x27;s too much for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe it&#x27;s safer to take 2 stamps and the thimble, leaving 2 stamps and soap for the other player. That way, if the other player took 2 stamps, we&#x27;d both have complementary proposals.<br/><br/>But wait, if the other player&#x27;s proposal was for 2 stamps and the thimble, then my proposal would conflict because I also took the thimble. So I need to think about avoiding overlapping claims.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should prioritize the thimble and then take as many stamps as possible without overstepping.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player has already made a proposal. So if I make a proposal now, it&#x27;s my response. So perhaps I should aim to complement whatever they took.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe I should try to take the thimble and 3 stamps, which gives me 2 + 3*2=8 points. But if the other player took, say, the thimble and 1 stamp, that would cause overlap because both of us want the thimble. So we&#x27;d both get zero. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the thimble and 2 stamps, and the other player took 2 stamps and the soap, that could work. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to take all the stamps because they have the highest point value. Each stamp gives 2 points, and there are 4, which is 8 points total. The thimble is 2 points, and soap is 0. So total possible points from the items are 2 + 0 + 8 = 10.<br/><br/>If I can get all the stamps and the thimble, that&#x27;s 10 points, but the other player would get nothing. But since we need complementary proposals, if I take all, they can&#x27;t take anything. So the maximum points would be 10 for me, but that&#x27;s not good because the other player might not accept that, or perhaps they have a different value function.<br/><br/>Wait, no. The way the rules work, if our proposals are complementary, we both get our points. If I take all the stamps and thimble, and the other player doesn&#x27;t take anything, then their proposal would presumably take nothing, which would be complementary. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, if they take something, we might have overlap.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should aim for a fair split. Let&#x27;s say I take the thimble and 2 stamps (total 6 points), and the other player takes the other 2 stamps and the soap (which could be 4 points if they value stamps as I do). That way, total is 6 + 4 = 10.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. Maybe they don&#x27;t care about stamps as much, or maybe they do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the thimble and 3 stamps, leaving 1 stamp and soap for the other player. If they took the 1 stamp and soap, that&#x27;s possible. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the stamps because they are the most valuable to me. Let&#x27;s see: there are 4 stamps. If I take 4 stamps, that&#x27;s 8 points. The thimble is 2, but the other player might have taken it, making overlapping.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player took the thimble and 3 stamps, which would be 2 + 6=8 points. Then I would have 1 stamp left, which is 2 points. That would be a total of 10, but if I proposed the same, there would be overlap.<br/><br/>Wait, but the initial step is that the other player has already submitted a proposal. So perhaps I should think about what their proposal could be, considering that they try to maximize their own utility and perhaps ours.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, I have to make a safe proposal.<br/><br/>Perhaps the safest is to take the thimble and 2 stamps, leaving 2 stamps and soup. That way, if the other player took 2 stamps, we can complement each other. Alternatively, if they took the thimble, I&#x27;d have to see.<br/><br/>Wait, but if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, thimble and 1 stamp, and I propose thimble and 2 stamps, then we both want the thimble, so it&#x27;s conflicting. So that would result in zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should avoid taking the thimble if I think the other player wants it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should just take the stamps and leave the thimble, in case the other player took it.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to take all the stamps, since they give the most points. I can take 4 stamps, which is 8 points. But then the other player might have taken the thimble, and we can coexist if they didn&#x27;t take stamps. But if they took stamps, we have a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let me consider the possible scenarios:<br/><br/>Option 1: I take the thimble and 2 stamps.<br/><br/>My proposal: [Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 stamps]<br/><br/>This leaves 2 stamps and 1 soap. If the other player took 2 stamps and 1 soap, our proposals are complementary. If they took the thimble, then conflict.<br/><br/>Option 2: I take 4 stamps.<br/><br/>Proposal: [Proposal: 4 stamps]<br/><br/>This leaves thimble and soap. If the other player took thimble and soap, we are good.<br/><br/>Option 3: I take the thimble and 3 stamps.<br/><br/>Leaves 1 stamp and soap.<br/><br/>So, which is better?<br/><br/>I think option 1 and 2 are safer because they allow the other player to take something without overlapping.<br/><br/>Option 2 gives me 8 points, but if the other player took stamps, we conflict.<br/><br/>Option 1 gives me 6 points, but if the other player took 2 stamps, we are good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the best is to take the thimble and as many stamps as possible without overstepping.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might have taken the thimble, so if I also take the thimble, we both lose.<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps I should focus on stamps, since they are 4 in number, making it easier to split.<br/><br/>So, I think I&#x27;ll propose taking 2 stamps, leaving 2 for the other player, and if they took the thimble, that&#x27;s fine. If they took some stamps, maybe we can both take 2 each, and I can have the thimble.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know. So, perhaps to maximize the total points, I should go for the thimble and 2 stamps, allowing the other player to take 2 stamps and soap. That way, we both get points.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player took the thimble, I can just take 4 stamps, but that might conflict if the other player also took some stamps.<br/><br/>This is tricky. I think the safest bet is to take the thimble and 2 stamps, so I can ensure that even if the other player took some stamps, we might not conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, no, if the other player took the thimble, I can&#x27;t take it. So perhaps I should not take the thimble unless I&#x27;m certain.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just take stamps to be safe.<br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go with taking 4 stamps. That way, if the other player took the thimble, we&#x27;re fine. If they took some stamps, we might conflict, but maybe they didn&#x27;t. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/></p>
