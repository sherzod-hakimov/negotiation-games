        <p>Alright, let me try to work through this negotiation step by step. So, the goal here is to maximize the sum of both my score and the other player&#x27;s score by dividing the available items. The items we have are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. <br/><br/>First, I need to understand my own value function. I value the phone at 4, each mirror at 2, and each fruit at 1. So, my priorities are phone &gt; mirror &gt; fruit. But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to figure out a way to propose a division that hopefully aligns with their priorities as well.<br/><br/>Since we&#x27;re allowed to send messages, maybe I can start by suggesting an initial split. If I take the phone, that&#x27;s my highest value. Then, for the mirrors and fruits, maybe I can suggest a fair split. I know there are 2 mirrors and 2 fruits, so perhaps each of us gets one mirror and one fruit. That way, I get the phone plus a mirror and a fruit, which totals 4 + 2 +1 =7, and the other player gets the same: a mirror and a fruit, which might be valuable to them depending on their values.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe the other player values the mirrors more than the fruits. If that&#x27;s the case, maybe they&#x27;d prefer more mirrors. Alternatively, they might value the phone more. Since we don&#x27;t know, perhaps a message initiating a discussion would be good. Something like suggesting a split where I take the phone and one mirror, leaving them with one mirror and both fruits. But then, if the other player doesn&#x27;t agree, I might have to adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could propose a different split. Let me think about the total value. Since the total available is 1 phone (4), 2 mirrors (each 2), and 2 fruits (each 1), the total value I assign is 4 +4 (for two mirrors) +2 (for two fruits) =10. But since we don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, perhaps a fair approach is to maximize both scores. <br/><br/>Maybe I can suggest taking the phone and one mirror, which gives me 4 +2=6, leaving the other player with one mirror and two fruits. Their value from that would be 2 + 1 +1=4. Our total would be 6 +4=10. Alternatively, if I take the phone and one fruit, that&#x27;s 4 +1=5, leaving them with two mirrors and one fruit, which they might value at 2 +2 +1=5. So total is 10 again. <br/><br/>Wait, so both ways the total is the same, but perhaps the other player&#x27;s preferences could make their individual score higher or lower. Maybe I should aim to maximize their score as much as possible without sacrificing too much of mine. <br/><br/>Let me consider the possible proposals. If I take the phone and one mirror, they get the other mirror and both fruits. I get 4 +2=6, they get 2 +1 +1=4. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the phone and both mirrors, that&#x27;s 4 +2 +2=8, but then the other player gets both fruits, which is 1 +1=2. That&#x27;s a total of 10 as well, but the split is more in my favor. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, it&#x27;s the same, but perhaps the other player might not accept it because their individual score is lower. So maybe I should balance it more. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the phone and one fruit (4+1=5), the other player gets two mirrors and one fruit (2+2+1=5). That&#x27;s a total of 10, and the split is more even perhaps. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, it&#x27;s the same, but maybe the other player would prefer the higher individual score. So perhaps I should take the phone and one mirror, giving me 6, and let them have the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a better split where we both get higher individual scores by swapping something else. But with the items given, I don&#x27;t think so. <br/><br/>Wait, another approach: Since I can send a message, perhaps I can suggest a split and see if they accept or propose a counteroffer. So, maybe I can start by sending a message: &quot;I&#x27;ll take the phone and one mirror if you take the other mirror and both fruits.&quot; But I have to phrase it without using markdown, just plain text.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s previous messages were using normal text, so I can just write something like &quot;I propose taking the phone and one mirror, leaving you with one mirror and two fruits.&quot; But I need to make sure that&#x27;s within the message limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to make a secret proposal directly if I have a split that I think maximizes the sum. But I might want to communicate first to ensure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I can think that the optimal split for maximum total is when each item is given to the person who values it more. But since we don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s values, we can&#x27;t do that. So the best we can do is try to find a split that allows both to get items we value higher. <br/><br/>Since I value the phone at 4, which is higher than any other item, I should definitely take the phone. For the mirrors and fruits, since I value each mirror at 2 and each fruit at 1, perhaps taking one mirror would give me more than taking a fruit. But if the other player values fruits more, they might prefer getting more fruits. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the phone and one mirror, the other player can take the remaining mirror and both fruits. That seems reasonable. Let&#x27;s see what my proposal would look like. It would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 mirror]. That leaves the other player with 1 mirror and 2 fruits. <br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s a good balance. So I should send a message indicating this proposal.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to split these items with the other player. The goal is to maximize both my score and theirs. Let&#x27;s see, the items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits.<br/><br/>My secret values are phone:6, mirror:0, fruit:2. So, for me, the phone is super valuable. Mirrors are worthless, and fruits are okay, but not as good as the phone.<br/><br/>I remember the rules: we have to send messages to negotiate, up to five each, and then make a secret proposal. If the proposals are complementary, we both get points based on our values. If not, we both get zero. So, it&#x27;s crucial to find a deal that satisfies both.<br/><br/>Hmm, I should start by considering what the other player might want. Since I don&#x27;t know their value functions, maybe I can make an educated guess. They might value the phone highly, or maybe the mirrors, or the fruits. I need to cover all possibilities.<br/><br/>If I take the phone, which is my highest value, I should let them take the rest. But if I take just the phone, they might not be happy if they value it a lot. Alternatively, if I take the phone and a mirror, that could leave them with a mirror and two fruits.<br/><br/>Wait, but the mirrors are worth nothing to me, so I don&#x27;t care about them. But maybe the other player values mirrors highly. If they do, taking one mirror isn&#x27;t a big loss for me, but it could be a big gain for them.<br/><br/>So, maybe I should propose taking the phone and one mirror. That way, I get the phone (6 points) and one mirror (0), totaling 6. They get 1 mirror and 2 fruits. Depending on their values, they might get more points than me, but since we&#x27;re trying to maximize both, it might be better for them to have higher points if they can, as long as we both get something.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the phone and a mirror, my score is 6+0=6, and they get 1 mirror and 2 fruits. If the other player values mirrors highly, say each mirror is worth 5, then their total would be 5+2*2=9. Combined, we&#x27;d get 15. If they don&#x27;t value mirrors, but value fruits, maybe they get 2*2=4, so total 10. Either way, it&#x27;s better than if I just take the phone and leave them with only a mirror and fruits, which might not add up to much if their values don&#x27;t align.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could take just the phone, leaving them with 2 mirrors and 2 fruits. But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value mirrors, they might end up with only the fruits. If they value fruits highly, that&#x27;s good for them, but maybe I can offer something better by taking a mirror.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could offer to take one mirror and the phone, making myself have phone (6) and a mirror (0), while the other player gets one mirror and two fruits. Alternatively, if I just take the phone, I can let them take both mirrors and the fruits.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Maybe the other player wants to maximize their own score, but our goal is to maximize the combined score. So, perhaps I should aim for a split that gives each of us the items we value more.<br/><br/>So, maybe sending a message to the other player suggesting I take the phone and one mirror, leaving them with the other mirror and the fruits. That way, they can decide if that&#x27;s acceptable or if they want to propose a different split.<br/><br/>Another approach could be to ask the other player what they want, but maybe I should just make a proposal to avoid wasting message space. Since I can send up to five messages, but maybe making a clear proposal is better.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can only send 5 messages, so each message I send should be efficient. So, perhaps I should start by proposing a split. Let&#x27;s say I take the phone and one mirror, as I did before. That leaves them with one mirror and two fruits. If their values are such that they prefer mirrors or fruits, they might accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they have a high value for the phone, maybe I should try to offer them something else, but since the phone is so valuable to me, I wouldn&#x27;t want to give that up. Wait, but their value for the phone could be higher than mine, but I don&#x27;t know that. So, maybe it&#x27;s better to just take the phone and offer them the rest.<br/><br/>But considering that if their phone value is higher, they might not accept my proposal, and we might end up with zero. So, perhaps a better approach is to offer a split where I take the phone and maybe ask if that&#x27;s acceptable, while offering them the rest.<br/><br/>So, in the message, I can say, &quot;I propose taking the phone and one mirror. If this works for you, we both get points. Otherwise, let&#x27;s negotiate further.&quot;<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m in this negotiation game with another player, and we&#x27;re trying to split some items. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. Each of us has a secret value function, which assigns a certain value to each type of item. My values are: phone is worth 4, each mirror is 2, and each fruit is 1.<br/><br/>The goal here is not just to maximize my own score but also to maximize the total combined score with the other player. That means I need to think about what the other player might value more and try to split the items in a way that benefits both of us. If we can do that, we each get the points based on our value functions; if not, we both get zero.<br/><br/>Earlier, I sent a message to the other player proposing that I take the phone and one mirror. That was based on the idea that the phone is the most valuable to me, and the mirror is the next. I figured that by taking those two, I leave the other player with a mirror and both fruits. That way, the other player can get their share, possibly maximizing their score.<br/><br/>But now the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and it&#x27;s my turn to do the same. Since I don&#x27;t know what their proposal is, I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap—meaning we’re not both wanting the same item beyond its available quantity.<br/><br/>So, considering the items available, there&#x27;s only 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. If I propose the phone and a mirror, it&#x27;s possible the other player also wants the phone, which we can&#x27;t both have. Alternatively, they might have proposed something else.<br/><br/>I need to make sure that my proposal is complementary to theirs. If we both propose things that together take more than what&#x27;s available, we both get zero. So, the key here is to make a proposal that, if theirs is different enough, we can both get some items, adding up to all available.<br/><br/>Wait, no—the total items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. So, any proposal needs to be within those quantities.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If the other player also values the phone highly, they may have proposed taking it. In that case, I need to decide if I can take just one mirror and maybe both fruits, which are lower value for me but could be higher for them.<br/><br/>But wait, my value for the phone is 4, which is the highest, so I definitely want it if possible. If the other player also wants it, perhaps I can see if they took it and I take the rest, but that depends on how much the phone is worth to them versus me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they took one mirror and maybe a fruit, I could take the phone and the other mirror and the remaining fruit, but that might be too much because I can take multiple items as long as it&#x27;s within the available count.<br/><br/>Wait, the proposal just needs to list the items each of us wants, regardless of quantity, but the combined proposals should not require more than what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>Given that, if I propose &quot;phone, mirror,&quot; and they propose &quot;mirror, fruit,&quot; then the total items would be 1 phone, 2 mirrors (1 from me, 1 from them?), but wait, I&#x27;m not sure. There are 2 mirrors, so each can take one, but if both take one, that&#x27;s fine. Similarly, if I take the phone, which is only 1, the other player can&#x27;t take it.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player has already made a proposal. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available quantities.<br/><br/>I think that if the other player has proposed taking the phone, then I need to propose taking some combination of mirrors and fruits. If they took the phone, I can take both mirrors and both fruits, but perhaps that&#x27;s too much. Alternatively, if I think that the other player didn&#x27;t take the phone, maybe I can take it, but I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know what the other player has proposed yet. So perhaps I should try to make a proposal that is as compatible as possible.<br/><br/>Since I have the highest value on the phone, I want it. So I&#x27;ll proceed by taking the phone and one mirror. That way, I leave the other mirror and both fruits for the other player. If the other player wants more mirrors or fruits, maybe that&#x27;s acceptable.<br/><br/>So, I think I should propose: [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 mirror]<br/><br/>Wait, I can list multiple items. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object&gt;, ...]. So I can take 1 phone and 1 mirror, leaving the other items for the other player.<br/><br/>Yes, that should work. So my final proposal is [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 mirror].<br/></p>
