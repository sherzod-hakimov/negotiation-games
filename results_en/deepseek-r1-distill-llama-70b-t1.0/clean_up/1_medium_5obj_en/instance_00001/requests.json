I will forward it to your partner.\n2. `MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)`: to move an object to a new position, where `<X>` is the column and `<Y>` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.\n* If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.\n* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: <MESSAGE>` command!\n\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n\n\n**End of Game**\n\nIf you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.\n\nBoth players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nThe closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing this game where I have a grid with some letters on it, and there's another player with a similar grid but the letters are placed differently. My goal is to move my letters so that both our grids end up with the same configuration. I can only move one object per turn and I have to communicate with the other player using the SAY command. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grid layout. The grid columns are labeled 1 to 7 from left to right, and the rows are 1 to 7 from top to bottom. The objects are 'W', 'I', 'T', 'C', 'H'. Looking at my grid, I can see where each of these is placed.\n\nOn my board, I have:\n- Cell (1,1) has 'C'\n- Cell (2,2) has 'I'\n- Cell (7,6) has 'WT' together? Wait, no. Looking back, in row 6, which is column 7, it's written as 'W' and 'T' in the same cell? That doesn't make sense because each cell should hold only one object. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grid.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grid is represented as a 7x7 grid with some cells occupied. So, in row 6, cell 7 is labeled 'WT', but that must be a typo because each cell can only have one object. Or maybe it's that the cell in column 7, row 6 has 'W', and column 7, row 7 has 'H'? Let me clarify.\n\nWait no, the right edge has y-coordinates increasing downward. So row 1 is top, row 7 is bottom. So the grid is laid out with rows from top to bottom as 1 to 7, and columns from left to right as 1 to 7.\n\nLooking at the grid again:\n\nRow 1: Column 1 has 'C', columns 2,3,4,5,6,7 are empty (all '◌').\nRow 2: Column 2 has 'I', columns 1,3,4,5,6,7 are empty except for cell 2,2 has 'I', and there's a vertical line after column 1, maybe indicating something, but probably just the grid structure.\nRow 3: All cells are empty except for some lines, maybe indicating borders, but not relevant for object placement.\nRow 4: Similarly, all empty cells except for lines.\nRow 5: Not sure, maybe some lines but no objects.\nRow 6: Cell 7,6 has 'WT' and 'H' in row 7,7? Wait, this seems confusing. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the grid is using characters to draw the borders. So, for each row, the cells are separated by '│' and there are horizontal lines with '─' and corners with '┌', '┍', etc. So, I need to parse each row correctly.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nRow 1:\n║C◌◌│◌│◌║\nSo, columns 1 has 'C', columns 2,3,4,5,6,7 are empty as they have '◌'.\n\nRow 2:\n║◌I◌│◌├─╢\nColumns 1: empty, column2 has 'I', columns 3 is empty, then a line after column3, so column4 is empty, and then some lines.\n\nWait, maybe the actual cell contents are separated by '│' and '║' is the edge. So each cell is between the '│'s.\n\nSo for row 1, the cells are:\n\n[C, ◌, ◌ | ◌ | ◌]\n\nBut since there are three sections: first section has 'C◌◌', then a '│', then '◌', another '│', then '◌', and end with '║' on both ends.\n\nWait, perhaps each row after the first has more sections because of the grid lines. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that each cell in a row is separated by '│', and the number of cells per row is 7. But the way it's drawn with the grid lines can make it have varying numbers of sections. So maybe each row has 7 cells, and the grid lines are just for visual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is split into three sections by the vertical lines, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me focus on the initial grid descriptions:\n\n- In row 1: cells (1,1) is 'C', others are empty.\n- Row 2: (2,2) is 'I'.\n- Row 6: in the last cell (7,6) is 'W', and in (7,7) is 'H'? Or in (7,6) there's both 'W' and 'T'? Wait, in row 6, the cell is '◌WT' which probably means that cell 7,6 has 'W' and 'T' together, which isn't possible because each cell should have one object. So maybe it's a typo, and the 'T' is in a different cell.\n\nWait, looking back, the grid shows:\n\nRow 6 as:\n║◌│◌│◌WT║ 6\n\nSo, columns 1: '◌', column2: '◌', column3: '◌WT', but that can't be right because each cell should be a single character. So maybe it's that columns 5,6,7 in row 6 are merged into one cell with 'WT', but that doesn't fit the grid structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the intended is that in row 6, column7 has 'W', and row7, column7 has 'H'.\n\nWait, row 7 is:\n║◌│◌│◌◌H║ 7\n\nSo, in row7, columns 5 to 7: cell5 is '◌', cell6 is '◌', cell7 is 'H'.\n\nSo, putting it all together, my initial grid has the following objects:\n\n- C at (1,1)\n- I at (2,2)\n- W at (7,6)\n- H at (7,7)\n- T must be somewhere else? Wait, where is T? Because according to the list, the objects are W, I, T, C, H. So I must have T at some cell.\n\nLooking back, perhaps in row6, the cell (5,6) is 'T'? Because in the grid, row6 is drawn as:\n\n║◌│◌│◌WT║ 6\n\nSo columns 5,6,7: but each column should have one cell, so column5 is '◌', column6 is 'W', column7 is 'T'? But that would mean T is at (7,6). But in row7, column7 is H, so T at (7,6), W elsewhere?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should list out all the cells:\n\nRow1: columns1= C, others= empty.\nRow2: column2= I, others=empty.\nRow3-5: all empty.\nRow6: columns maybe have W and T?\n\nWait, perhaps in row6, columns 5,6,7 are drawn as \"◌WT\", meaning columns5=◌, column6= W, column7= T. So:\n\n- W at (6,6)\n- T at (7,6)\n\nAnd in row7, column7= H, as in row7, last cell has H.\n\nSo, my objects are:\n\nC at (1,1)\nI at (2,2)\nW at (6,6)\nT at (7,6)\nH at (7,7)\n\nWait, but that would mean in row6, column6 has W, column7 has T, and row7, column7 has H.\n\nSo yes, I have all five objects: C, I, W, T, H.\n\nSo, my initial positions are:\n\n- C: (1,1)\n- I: (2,2)\n- W: (6,6)\n- T: (7,6)\n- H: (7,7)\n\nNow, I need to communicate with the other player to align our objects. Since I can only send one command per turn, and the other player is doing the same, I need to figure out a strategy.\n\nFirst, I should probably suggest a meeting point where we can agree on where each object should go. Maybe I can propose placing all objects in a specific area, like the bottom right corner, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can exchange our current positions and then come to a common configuration.\n\nBut since we can't see each other's boards, we have to negotiate. So, I need to send a message to the other player suggesting a way to align our objects.\n\nLet me start by sending a message suggesting that we take turns describing the positions of our objects and try to find a common layout.\n\nI'll use the SAY command to send a message like:\n\n\"Let's agree on a common configuration. I can suggest placing each letter in specific cells. Let me know what you think.\"\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to suggest a standard configuration, like each object in a specific cell, such as C at (1,1), I at (2,2), W at (6,6), T at (5,6), H at (7,7). Or perhaps create a grid where each object is in a unique cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can ask the other player to describe their current positions of objects, and then we can compare and find a way to synchronize.\n\nBut since we can't see each other's grids, it's tricky. So perhaps using a hashing method or a predetermined pattern.\n\nWait, another idea: since the game allows 20 rounds, I can suggest moving my objects in a certain order and have the other player mirror the moves.\n\nAlternatively, I can propose a standard layout. For example:\n\n- C stays at (1,1)\n- I stays at (2,2)\n- W moves to (7,7)\n- T moves to (6,7)\n- H moves to (5,7)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a good approach. It's better to communicate first.\n\nSo, I'll send a message asking the other player to suggest a common configuration or propose a way to coordinate our moves.\n\nPerhaps starting with something like:\n\n\"Hello! Let's work together to align our objects. I propose that we move all our objects to specific cells. For example, let's agree to place C at (1,1), I at (2,2), W at (7,7), T at (6,7), and H at (5,7). Let me know if you agree or have a better proposal.\"\n\nIf the other player agrees, we can start moving our pieces accordingly. But if not, we can negotiate further.\n\nWait, but I don't know the other player's grid. Maybe I should first ask them to describe their current positions. Or perhaps I can describe mine and they can compare.\n\nAlternatively, I can send all my object positions first.\n\nSo, I can say:\n\n\"My current object positions are C(1,1), I(2,2), W(6,6), T(7,6), H(7,7). What are yours?\"\n\nBut wait, the other player's grid is different, so their initial positions are different. So, sharing my positions might not help unless they can map their own.\n\nAlternatively, we can agree on a standard configuration, like all objects in the top-left corner or something, but that might be too time-consuming.\n\nBut since the game is collaborative, maybe the first step is to negotiate a target configuration.\n\nI think the best approach is to send a message asking the other player to agree on specific target positions for each object. So, I'll proceed to send that message.\n"

From the history, I can see that the user is playing a collaborative game where they need to align objects on a grid with their partner. They're using the SAY command to communicate their suggested target configuration.\n\nIn the first attempt, the user included a message with some extra text before the SAY command, which resulted in a penalty. They tried again but still got a penalty because of the same issue—probably adding extra text before the command.\n\nI need to understand why the user is making this mistake. Maybe they're not fully aware of the strict formatting rules, where only the command itself should be sent without any additional text. They might be adding explanations or instructions before the command, which the system flags as penalties.\n\nThe user's goal is clearly to coordinate with their partner to move the objects to specific positions. They suggested moving C, I, W, T, and H to certain coordinates. But the penalties are hindering their progress, so they need to adjust their approach.\n\nI should encourage them to stick strictly to the command format. Instead of writing explanations or greetings before the command, they should directly send the SAY or MOVE command. Maybe they thought the extra info would help communicate better, but it's causing issues.\n\nI should explain that the system is very strict about the format and that any extra text, even if helpful, will penalize them. Reassuring them that the partner will understand the message as long as it's correctly formatted is important. \n\nSo, I'll suggest they try sending the command again, making sure nothing precedes it. Also, reminding them that each move needs to be a separate command without additional text. This will help them avoid further penalties and keep the game moving smoothly.\n\nIn the current situation, the user needs to resend the SAY command without any leading text. They should check their message for any extra spaces or lines before the command and ensure it's clean. Once they do that, they'll avoid penalties and can continue coordinating with their partner effectively.\n"

Let's see, from the history, it looks like I've been getting penalized multiple times for including extra text before my commands. The game master keeps saying my responses have content before the command, which isn't allowed.\n\nOkay, so the rule is that each turn, I can only send either a `SAY` or a `MOVE` command, and nothing else. But each time I try, I'm getting penalized. That suggests that even though I think I'm just sending the command, there's something else being included that shouldn't be.\n\nLooking at the previous attempts, I wrote things like \"Let me start by sending a message...\" or \"I'll suggest a target configuration.\" Those are definitely additional sentences before the command. Then, when I tried to correct it, I still had \"**SAY:**\" with some text before, but maybe some hidden characters or markdown was causing issues.\n\nWait, in the last attempt, I used markdown italic text for my thought, which the system might be interpreting as extra text before the command. Maybe the AI is adding some formatting that the game master doesn't accept.\n\nSo, to fix this, I need to ensure that my response is solely the command itself without any preceding text. I should avoid any markdown, additional explanations, or thinking indicators. Just the plain command.\n\nLet me try that again, but this time carefully, without any extra text. I'll focus on the exact wording and structure required. I'll make sure there are no leading spaces or characters before the command starts.\n"

You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.\n\n\n**Goal:**\n\nBoth players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.\n\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:\n 1. `SAY: <MESSAGE>`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.\n2. `MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)`: to move an object to a new position, where `<X>` is the column and `<Y>` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.\n* If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.\n* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: <MESSAGE>` command!\n\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n\n\n**End of Game**\n\nIf you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.\n\nBoth players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nThe closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"

The grid has coordinates with the x-axis going right and the y-axis going down. There are objects W, I, T, C, H placed randomly on both players' grids. The goal is to move these objects so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates on both grids.\n\nI need to communicate with the other player using only the SAY: command to agree on a common configuration. The key is to send messages that are clear and unambiguous. In the earlier attempts, I tried sending messages suggesting specific positions for each object, but I kept getting penalties because I was including extra text before or after the command.\n\nI realize now that I must stick strictly to the format: only SAY: followed by the message. No extra words or explanations outside the command itself. So, I need to craft a message that clearly states the proposed positions without any additional fluff.\n\nLet me think about the best way to phrase this. I should list each object with its target coordinates in a way that's easy to parse. Maybe using a format like Object - (X,Y) for each one. This will make it clear and concise.\n\nSince we've already tried suggesting positions before but got penalties because of extra text, I should make sure this time the message is just the command with the targets listed neatly. Also, I should consider that the other player might not be able to see my grid, so the message needs to be self-explanatory without any context.\n\nI think it's also important to end with a call to action, like asking them to confirm or suggest alternatives, to keep the communication flowing. This way, we can adjust our strategy based on each other's inputs.\n\nLet me draft the message again, making sure to adhere strictly to the format and clarity. I'll list each object with its target position and then ask for confirmation or suggestions. That should cover all necessary information without any extra text that could cause penalties.\n\nAlright, I think I've got a clear and concise message that fits within the required format.

            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to move our game pieces to the same coordinates as the other player. The goal is to get all the identical objects to the same spots on both boards without seeing each other's setups. That sounds a bit tricky, but I think with some careful planning, we can make this work.\n\nFirst, I remember that we have the objects W, I, T, C, and H scattered on our grids. I need to decide where each of these should go so that both players' boards match. Since we can't see each other's boards, communication is key here. That means we need to agree on a common target configuration through messages.\n\nI tried sending a message a few times, but I kept getting penalized for adding extra text before the SAY command. That's frustrating because each penalty brings us closer to losing. I have to make sure that my next move is just the command without any extra words before it. Maybe I was accidentally adding spaces or other characters which caused the penalties.\n\nI also need to be precise with the commands. The format is either \"SAY: <message>\" or \"MOVE: <object>, (<x>, <y>)\". Nothing else. So I have to make sure I strictly follow that format without adding anything before or after.\n\nI think the target configuration we agreed on was moving C to (1,1), I to (2,2), W to (6,6), T to (7,6), and H to (7,7). Maybe I should suggest moving each object one by one to confirm each move. That way, we can ensure that both players are on the same page without overwhelming each other with too much information at once.\n\nPerhaps starting with moving C to (1,1) would be a good first step. If the other player confirms that, then we can proceed to move I to (2,2), and so on. This step-by-step approach might help prevent confusion and minimize penalties.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the other player might have a different initial configuration, so their starting positions could vary. It's crucial to be patient and wait for their responses to each suggestion before making any moves. Rushing could lead to more penalties if we move objects to already occupied spots.\n\nI also need to keep track of the penalties. We've accumulated 8 out of 12, so we have to be careful not to make any more mistakes. One more penalty could bring us very close to losing, so precision is vital now.\n\nMaybe I should start by sending just the target positions again, ensuring that the message is clear and concise without any extra text. I have to make sure that the message is within the SAY command format and nothing else.\n\nI'll try sending the message again, focusing solely on the command without any additional text before it. This time, I'll double-check that I'm not including anything extra that could cause another penalty. Hopefully, the other player will receive it correctly and respond without issues.\n\nIf there's confusion, maybe suggesting a different configuration or asking the other player to propose their own target could help. Flexibility is important, and working together is the only way we can succeed in this game.\n\nIn summary, my plan is to:\n\n1. Send the target configuration clearly using the correct format without any extra text.\n2. Start moving objects one at a time, confirming with the other player after each move.\n3. Be patient and wait for responses to minimize penalties.\n4. Adjust the strategy based on the other player's feedback.\n\nBy following this plan, I think we can align our objects efficiently and finish the game successfully within the 20-round limit.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing this game where me and another player have grids with objects on them. The goal is to move these objects so that each object ends up in the same spot on both grids. The objects are C, I, T, W, and H. We can communicate using the SAY command, but I keep getting penalties because I'm not following the format correctly. \n\nSo, the problem is that when I send a message, I'm accidentally adding text before the command, which is causing penalties. I need to make sure that the only thing I send is either \"SAY: <message>\" or \"MOVE: <object>, (<x>, <y>)\" without any extra text before or after. \n\nI've tried a few times but keep messing up. Maybe I'm not understanding exactly what's allowed. I think the key is to only have the command and nothing else. So, if I want to send a message, it should be \"SAY: <message>\", with nothing else before or after that. Similarly, if I want to move something, it should be \"MOVE: <object>, (<x>, <y>)\", without any extra words.\n\nI need to remember that each command is a single line with only that exact structure. No explanations, no extra sentences, nothing else. That way, the game master can parse it correctly without penalizing me. So, to avoid penalties, I just need to stick strictly to the command format without any additional text.\n\nThis means when I send a message, I have to make sure it's just \"SAY:\" followed by the message, and that's it. No additional text before or after. Similarly, when moving an object, it's \"MOVE: <object>, (<x>, <y>)\" and nothing else.\n\nI think the main mistake was adding things like \"Let's move...\" or \"Confirm or suggest...\" which are extra and not part of the command structure. So I need to be precise and only send the command as specified.\n\nIn the future, when I want to communicate, I'll just send the message without any extra words. For example, if I want to propose moving objects, I'll send \"SAY: Let's move C to (1,1), I to (2,2), etc.\" and that's it. Or, if I'm ready to move, just send \"MOVE: C, (1,1)\".\n\nThis should help reduce penalties and allow me to play the game smoothly.\n"

You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.\n\n\n**Goal:**\n\nBoth players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.\n\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:\n 1. `SAY: <MESSAGE>`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.\n2. `MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)`: to move an object to a new position, where `<X>` is the column and `<Y>` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.\n* If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.\n* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: <MESSAGE>` command!\n\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n\n\n**End of Game**\n\nIf you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.\n\nBoth players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nThe closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"

            "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to play this game properly because I keep getting penalties. Let me start by reading the rules again to make sure I understand what I'm doing wrong.\n\nOkay, the goal is to get identical objects on both players' boards to the same coordinates. The way to do that is by communicating with the other player using the SAY command and moving objects with the MOVE command. The tricky part is that we can only send one command per turn, and it has to be just that command without any extra text. If I add anything else, like explanations or multiple commands, I get penalized. Since we've already accumulated 11 penalties, which is almost the limit, I need to be super careful now.\n\nLooking back at my previous messages, I see that I kept including extra text before or after the command, which is why I got penalized. The system is strict about the format: it should only be \"SAY: <MESSAGE>\" or \"MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)\" and nothing else. So, I need to make sure my next message is just that without any additional words.\n\nI think the key here is to send a clear and concise message that the other player can understand and act upon without ambiguity. Since we've tried suggesting positions before, maybe I should try a simpler approach this time. Perhaps just stating the desired positions without any extra verbiage.\n\nLet me try composing a message that only includes the command and the necessary information. Maybe list all the objects with their target positions in a straightforward way. That way, the other player can easily parse the information and respond appropriately.\n\nAlso, considering the penalties, I should make sure that I'm only sending one command each turn to avoid further issues. Maybe in the next move, I can start by confirming if the other player is onboard with the configuration I suggested previously, but I have to do it without any extra text.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more direct. Just send the positions without any questions, so the other player knows exactly what to do. If I keep it simple, they can either acknowledge or adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me also think about possible mistakes. Maybe the other player is not responding because my messages are getting too long or have extra text. So, trimming it down to the essentials is crucial. I need to make sure that each message is as clear as possible and follows the specified format to the letter.\n\nIn summary, my plan is to send a SAY command with a concise list of the target positions for each object, making sure not to include any additional text. This should help the other player understand the goal without confusion and avoid further penalties.\n\nAlright, time to put this into action.\n"

You cannot see the other player's board, and they cannot see yours.\n\n\n**Goal:**\n\nBoth players need to move the objects on their respective background so that identical objects end up at the same coordinates. You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal configuration.\n\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one of the following two commands:\n 1. `SAY: <MESSAGE>`: to send a message (everything up until the next line break) to the other player. I will forward it to your partner.\n2. `MOVE: <OBJECT>, (<X>, <Y>)`: to move an object to a new position, where `<X>` is the column and `<Y>` is the row. I will inform you if your move was successful or not.\n* If you don't stick to the format, or send several commands at once, I have to penalize you.\n* If both players accumulate more than 12 penalties, you both lose the game.\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `SAY: <MESSAGE>` command!\n\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, I have to penalize you. You get another try.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n\n\n**End of Game**\n\nIf you think you reached the goal of aligning all objects, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `SAY: finished?`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply with `SAY: finished!`, the game will end.\n\nBoth players win if the game ends within 20 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nThe closer the identical objects are in both game boards, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"
