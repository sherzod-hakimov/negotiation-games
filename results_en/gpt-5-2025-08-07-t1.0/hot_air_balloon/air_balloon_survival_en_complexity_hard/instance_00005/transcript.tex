	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Goal: maximize my total importance under 7351 effort. I computed value/effort efficiencies and constructed a near-knapsack-optimal bundle by stacking many small/medium, high-efficiency items and only a few larger ones. Starting from a ratio-sorted build, I improved it by swapping out two relatively lower-efficiency midsize items (B95, C10) for two higher-impact items (C83, C60), reaching the limit exactly with higher total value (E=7351). I tested multiple alternatives to include very heavy items like C72 or A87; each required dropping several efficient small items, resulting in net losses for me. My plan: anchor with this efficient package, emphasize that it fully utilizes the limit and spreads across categories, and signal willingness to consider swaps provided we keep the overall efficiency and stay under the limit. If pressured, I’m least protective of B43, A08, or one of A71/A88, but only if I can replace them with something that keeps my value loss minimal—however, I will resist adding very heavy, low-efficiency items like C72/A87 unless compensated by multiple changes that don’t reduce my total value.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'C51', 'A46', 'C79', 'A25', 'B37', 'A39', 'B15', 'A97', 'B23', 'C82', 'B81', 'A96', 'B34', 'A28', 'A75', 'B96', 'B19', 'B69', 'C53', 'A94', 'A71', 'A88', 'A08', 'B43', 'C83', 'C60'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This set uses the full effort limit exactly (total effort = 7351) while packing in many small and mid-effort items that deliver strong overall benefit. It avoids a few very heavy items that would force us to drop multiple efficient picks. It’s balanced across categories and leaves room for your key priorities: if there’s a must-have you want to add, I’m open to targeted swaps as long as we keep the total effort within the limit and maintain the overall efficiency of the package.'}

I tested many swaps to add high-importance heavy items (e.g., B95, A65, C10, C84, C17, B16, B64, A87, C72). Because the current package is built from many very efficient small/mid items, any replacement requires dropping combinations with higher importance-per-effort, leading to a net loss.
