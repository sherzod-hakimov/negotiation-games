I computed a high-efficiency bundle via ratio-based selection, then locally optimized with small swaps that increased total value without breaching the limit. Starting from a greedy set, I improved it by: B16->A97 (+17 v, +17 e), B64->C60 (+40 v, +40 e), A88->B19 (+34 v, +34 e), and A28->B64 (+93 v, +93 e). Final set uses 9267 effort (55 spare) and yields high total value for me. I’ll anchor with this strong package while signaling flexibility: I can consider one-for-one swaps with similar effort or a larger trade if they strongly want a heavy item, but I’ll ask them to name top must-haves. I won’t reveal my scores publicly and will justify by efficiency and workload balance.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'A25', 'A71', 'C17', 'B69', 'A39', 'B96', 'A08', 'C84', 'B43', 'C79', 'A46', 'C10', 'C53', 'A94', 'C60', 'B95', 'A65', 'C72', 'B19', 'A97', 'B15', 'B64', 'C82'}\nARGUMENT: {'This package keeps total effort comfortably under the limit while prioritizing efficient, lower-effort items that deliver strong overall benefit. It also spans a broad mix across A/B/C items and even leaves a small buffer (~55 effort) to accommodate minor adjustments. If you have 1–2 must-have items not included here, suggest them and we can consider targeted one-for-one swaps of similar effort to keep us within the limit. If you prefer adding a heavier item, we can discuss which multiple smaller items would need to be traded out to fit it while keeping the workload feasible.'}"

To make a minimal, targeted improvement while staying within the limit, I suggest swapping in A28, B16, and A88 for C82, B19, and C79. This uses nearly all of the existing buffer but still stays under the cap (total effort 9321 ≤ 9322). From my perspective, these three substitutions deliver stronger impact for comparable effort, keeping the overall mix and workload stable. If any of those three replacements are problematic for you, let me know which one is most sensitive and we can consider a nearby alternative of similar effort.'}"
