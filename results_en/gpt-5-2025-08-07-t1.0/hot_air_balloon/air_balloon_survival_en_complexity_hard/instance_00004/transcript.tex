	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Limit 6880. I computed a near-optimal knapsack for my utilities. I started with high value-per-effort small items, then optimized by swapping to fully utilize the budget. Initial greedy set (effort 6482, value 8957) had slack; I improved it by removing A97 (188,287) and adding C60 (577,676) using slack, yielding effort 6871, value 9346. With 9 effort remaining, I swapped C79 (564,663) for B34 (573,672) to hit the limit exactly and gain +9 value, resulting in a final set with total effort 6880 and total value 9355. I tested adding large items like C51, C83, A71, B95, B19, A65, B15; none could be included without removing combinations with higher total value due to the high efficiency of included items. The final proposal is therefore my strong optimum. I will anchor with this full-limit set and invite swaps that keep us at or below 6880, being cautious not to concede high-efficiency items. I won’t reveal my utilities and will request the other party’s must-haves to see if equivalent-effort trades are feasible.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'B81', 'A39', 'A96', 'A94', 'B23', 'A88', 'A75', 'A28', 'A25', 'B69', 'B96', 'C10', 'C53', 'A87', 'B64', 'A46', 'A08', 'B43', 'C84', 'B37', 'C72', 'C82', 'B16', 'C60', 'B34'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This set fully uses the available effort without exceeding the limit and focuses on items that deliver strong value relative to their effort. It’s a balanced package across item categories, making it efficient and practical. If you have a few must-have items, let me know which they are and we can explore targeted swaps of similar total effort to accommodate them while keeping the overall efficiency high and staying within the limit.'}
