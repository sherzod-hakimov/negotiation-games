        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I computed a high-utility subset for me under the 3481 limit using a knapsack-style selection. Best set I found is {C00, A71, B35, A04, C01, C54, A87, B41, B32, B86} with total effort 3445 and my total importance 4690. I tested swaps and found this beats adding A03 or A10 alone; the only competitive alternative is replacing B32+B86 with A03 or A10, but those reduce my utility. I’ll anchor with this strong proposal, signal flexibility to swap in A03 or A10 if they highly value them (e.g., trade for B32+B86), and avoid very low-yield items for me (C17, A77, B33). I’ll ask for their must-haves to see if we can make a targeted swap while keeping most of my core set.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This package efficiently uses the budget (3445/3481) and avoids very heavy items that would force multiple cuts. It keeps a broad mix across A/B/C and includes the near-zero-cost item C00. If you strongly prefer a heavier item like A03 or A10, we can consider swapping it in by dropping B32+B86 to stay within the limit. Let me know your must-haves and any items you don’t care about, and we can fine-tune while keeping the total effort compliant.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal gives me 3546 utility. I can substantially improve by swapping low-value-to-me A-items for A77 and especially B33. Best high-utility within limit I found is keeping C00, B35, C54, C01, B41, B32, B86 and adding A77+B33 while dropping A04, A71, A87: effort 3354, utility 4711. A slightly better utility (4767) exists by replacing B41 and C01 with C17 (effort 3276), but that’s a bigger departure from their “avoid heavy items” stance and may face resistance. I’ll open with the A77+B33 counter that preserves 7/10 of their items, argue efficiency and slack, and keep C17 as a later concession. I will also push back on their idea to drop B32+B86 for A03/A10 since those are low to me.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Thanks for the thoughtful package. I propose a small re-balance that keeps 7 of your 10 items while using the budget more efficiently (3354/3481) and adding more leverage via A77 and B33. Concretely, this swaps out A04, A71, and A87 for A77 and B33. It preserves the strong B/C backbone (C00, B35, C54, C01, B41, B32, B86), maintains category diversity, and leaves healthy slack for stability. I’d strongly prefer to keep B32 and B86 rather than dropping them for heavier A03/A10. If you really need one of A04/A71/A87 back, we can discuss targeted swaps, but this package should deliver more impact per unit effort while staying comfortably under the limit.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposal yields me very low utility (2677) because it includes two items I value poorly (A77=121, B33=97) while excluding my three top A-items (A04=780, A71=783, A87=668). Budget-wise, replacing B33 (802) and A77 (453) with A04 (461), A71 (332), and A87 (553) fits under the limit: 3354 - 802 - 453 + 461 + 332 + 553 = 3445 ≤ 3481. This exactly recovers my previously optimal set while honoring their stated preference to keep B32 and B86. If they push back on A87, I can offer a softer fallback that drops only B33 and adds A04 + A71 (effort 3345), preserving A77 for them, which still gives me strong value. I’ll refuse and counter with the full swap first, framed as an efficiency improvement and alignment with their B32/B86 preference.&#x27;}<br/><br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;B33&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Building on your backbone, this swap removes two very heavy/low-leverage items (B33 at 802 effort and A77 at 453) and replaces them with three higher-impact items while still staying well within budget: total effort becomes 3445/3481. It fully preserves your stated preference to keep B32 and B86, maintains the strong B/C core (C00, B35, C54, C01, B41), and uses the available capacity more productively.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their active proposal gives me 3546 utility. They explicitly offered a lighter variant that keeps A77, drops only B33, and adds A04 + A71; that variant gives me 4093 utility, preserves the backbone they value, and is well within budget (3345). It’s likely to be accepted quickly and is a solid compromise after they refused my previous package. I’ll refuse their current offer and formally propose the lighter variant. If needed later, I can try to claw back a bit more value with a minor swap (e.g., involving C17) while staying under the limit.&#x27;}<br/>REFUSE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A87&#x27;}<br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;You suggested a lighter path that drops only B33 and adds A04 + A71 while keeping A77—here it is formalized.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their latest proposal gives me solid utility (4143) and cleanly fits the limit. I tested potential improvements: (1) swapping A77 to A87 (my top upgrade) was already refused; (2) upgrading to A03/A10 requires dropping B86 and/or B32, which they explicitly prefer to keep. While dropping A77+B86 for A03 would slightly improve my payoff, it conflicts with their stated must-haves and risks stalemate. Given the alignment with their preferences and decent value for me, I’ll accept to secure the deal now.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;B35&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B32&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Agreed. This set preserves the shared backbone you emphasized, keeps B32 and B86 as requested, adds A04 and A71 for balance, and uses the budget efficiently with comfortable slack (3345/3481).&#x27;}</p>
