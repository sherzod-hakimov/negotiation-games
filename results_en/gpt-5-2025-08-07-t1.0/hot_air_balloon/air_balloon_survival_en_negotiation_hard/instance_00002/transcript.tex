A slightly better utility (4767) exists by replacing B41 and C01 with C17 (effort 3276), but that’s a bigger departure from their “avoid heavy items” stance and may face resistance. I’ll open with the A77+B33 counter that preserves 7/10 of their items, argue efficiency and slack, and keep C17 as a later concession.
