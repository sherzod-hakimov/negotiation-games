This keeps 7/9 of their items intact, preserves all of their apparent priorities (C00, B41, B86, B35, B32, A10, A87), and fits under the limit at 4021. If they resist C01, my fallback is a milder improvement for me that keeps nine items: swap B33 -> C54 (effort 3860), which I can offer next. If they won’t take either, I can still accept their current nine-item set to close, but I’ll first try for the optimal two-for-one swap.'}\nREFUSE: {'B35', 'A10', 'A87', 'B86', 'B32', 'B33', 'B41', 'C00', 'A77'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B35', 'A10', 'A87', 'B86', 'B32', 'B41', 'C00', 'C01'}\nARGUMENT: {\"Minimal change to finalize: trade A77 and B33 for C01. This keeps 7/9 of your items unchanged, retains your highlighted essentials (C00, B41, B86, B35, B32, A10, A87), and stays within the cap at 4021/4026. It consolidates two smaller-impact pieces into one higher-impact item while preserving the overall structure. If C01 is a nonstarter for you, an alternative that keeps nine items is your current set with a single swap B33 -> C54 (effort 3860). Let me know which you prefer so we can wrap this up.\"}"
