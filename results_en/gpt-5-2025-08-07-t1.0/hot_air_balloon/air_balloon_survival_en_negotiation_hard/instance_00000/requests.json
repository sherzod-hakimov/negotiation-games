Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 3624\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"C17\": 210, \"B41\": 291, \"A71\": 831, \"C00\": 111, \"B35\": 926, \"A77\": 827, \"A03\": 25, \"A04\": 121, \"C54\": 583, \"C01\": 766, \"A87\": 14, \"B32\": 559, \"B86\": 304, \"B33\": 989, \"A10\": 691}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"A71\": 65, \"C00\": 121, \"A10\": 138, \"B35\": 262, \"C01\": 389, \"B86\": 461, \"B41\": 484, \"C54\": 508, \"B32\": 583, \"A87\": 668, \"B33\": 780, \"A03\": 783, \"C17\": 808, \"A04\": 822, \"A77\": 868}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace.
