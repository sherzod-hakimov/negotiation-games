I improved the bundle by swapping in B60 and adjusting A84/B69 for C34/C92 to raise total value while staying well under the limit. Current set effort = 8090, leaving 80 spare. High-effort items I’m most willing to trade, if needed, are A05 or B09 (depending on what you want added). I will defend the small, high-efficiency items strongly.'}\nARGUMENT: {'This package packs a lot of impact into modest effort: many small-footprint items with big upside are included, and we’re still under the limit by 80.
