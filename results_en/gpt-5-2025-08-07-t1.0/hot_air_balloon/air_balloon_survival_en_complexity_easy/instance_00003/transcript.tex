Starting from a strong set, I optimized further by swapping B00 out for B46+B75 (+258 imp) and then refining to replace B75+C92 with B00 (+133 imp), ending with total effort 8700 (buffer 70) and total utility 15307 for me. I checked potential pair/triple swaps (e.g., involving C12, B75, C92, C15, B00, B12, C81, B94, B67) and found no better combination within the 8770 cap given the remaining items and spare capacity. The current set is near{-}Pareto for my side with many universally attractive, low{-}effort picks, while leaving a sliver of capacity and some medium{-}effort items I could discuss if needed. I will propose this strong but not maxed{-}out set and invite targeted swaps the other party values, while protecting my top{-}ratio items.'\}} \\
