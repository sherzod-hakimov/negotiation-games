Current set uses 7581/7605 effort and yields total utility 14552 for me. I avoided very low-efficiency items and kept many small, high-yield ones (B09, B46, A08, C34) to stay flexible. I’m ready to trade around mid-efficiency items (e.g., C12, B67, B94) if the partner pushes back, while defending clear winners. The 24-effort slack allows minor adjustments without breaking the limit.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B09', 'B46', 'A08', 'C34', 'B12', 'A66', 'A27', 'A30', 'A58', 'A16', 'B60', 'C70', 'C15', 'A84', 'B94', 'B10', 'B67', 'C12', 'B75', 'C35', 'A05', 'B69', 'C65'}\nARGUMENT: {'This package is tightly optimized for effort-efficiency while staying under the LIMIT (total effort 7581 ≤ 7605). It leans on many low-effort, high-impact items to leave room for your priorities, and it maintains 24 effort slack for quick swaps. If you need changes, propose specific must-haves and I can consider exchanging items like C12, B67, or B94 to accommodate you while keeping us within the limit.'}"
