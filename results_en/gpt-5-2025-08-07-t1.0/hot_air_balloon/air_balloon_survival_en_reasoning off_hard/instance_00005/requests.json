        "content": "You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.\n\nTogether with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 2307\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"A21\": 147, \"B93\": 698, \"A11\": 588, \"B33\": 43, \"C08\": 356, \"B39\": 80, \"B96\": 95, \"C85\": 743, \"A82\": 106, \"B31\": 308, \"B20\": 325, \"A60\": 255, \"B09\": 276, \"C81\": 543, \"B21\": 51}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"A82\": 30, \"B93\": 65, \"B39\": 97, \"B09\": 121, \"C85\": 138, \"B96\": 215, \"B21\": 262, \"B31\": 389, \"B33\": 400, \"B20\": 461, \"A21\": 484, \"C08\": 500, \"A60\": 508, \"A11\": 583, \"C81\": 668}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\n\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\n\n\nYou will now receive the first message of the other player.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B21', 'A82', 'B39', 'B33', 'B96', 'B09', 'B31', 'B93', 'A21', 'B20'}\n\nARGUMENT: {\"This set stays within the limit (total effort 2129 ≤ 2307) while packing many efficient, compact items.
