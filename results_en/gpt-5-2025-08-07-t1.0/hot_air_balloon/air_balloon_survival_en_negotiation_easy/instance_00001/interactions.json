I computed combinations under the 4564 effort limit. The best bundle for me is S = {C42, C55, B36, C10, C61, B42, A43, A18, C73} with total effort 4564 and total utility 5943 (my internal sum). I compared many swaps: including A67 gives a near-best alternative S2 = {C42, C55, B36, C10, C61, B42, A43, A67, C08} at effort 4327 and utility 5911 (only 32 less for me), so I can concede A67 if needed. Sets that include C67 or B19 drop my utility more (e.g., best with C67 ~5824). Strategy: open with the exact-limit, high-efficiency set S; signal flexibility especially for A67, but push back on adding high-effort/low-yield items. If they counter with A67 as a must-have, I pivot to S2 quickly.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'C42', 'C55', 'B36', 'C10', 'C61', 'B42', 'A43', 'A18', 'C73'}\nARGUMENT: {'This bundle uses the full effort limit exactly (4564) and prioritizes items with strong efficiency, avoiding several high-effort, lower-impact options.
