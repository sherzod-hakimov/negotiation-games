My highest ROI items are C42, A67, B42, C61, B36, A43, with good adds A18, C67, C73; I avoid low-ROI heavy items (A62, C43) and keep C10 flexible.

Plan: anchor on my best set, highlight efficiency and remaining headroom, invite their must-haves, and offer a clean swap path to include C10 by dropping A18 and C67. Resist adding A62 or C43 unless compensated by dropping multiple medium items, as they are low value for me.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'C42', 'A67', 'B42', 'C61', 'B36', 'A43', 'C73', 'A18', 'C67', 'C08'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This set stays well within the 3358 effort limit (total 3188) and prioritizes compact, efficient items so we cover a lot while leaving some headroom for adjustments.

If C10 is a must-have for you, I can accommodate it by swapping it in for A18 and C67 while keeping everything else (effort would be 3324).

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Their proposal is already very strong for me (value 5929) and under limit (3188). The best improvement for my value within the limit is to swap out C08 (low value/efficiency to me) for B19 (higher value to me), which exactly uses the remaining capacity: 3188 - 171 + 341 = 3358, and increases my value by +124 to 6053. Adding C10 would require dropping combinations that hurt my value more than the gain; the least-bad swap they suggested (A18 + C67 -> C10) is -93 for me, so I’ll avoid it unless they insist. I’ll propose the single-item swap C08 -> B19 as a minimal-change counter. If they push for C10, I can consider a fallback like swapping C73 + C67 -> C10, which is worse for me but keeps the structure intact; I won’t offer that unless necessary.'}\\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'C42', 'A67', 'B42', 'C61', 'B36', 'A43', 'C73', 'A18', 'C67', 'B19'}\\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'I like your structure a lot. With one small tweak—swap out C08 for B19—we stay within the limit exactly (total effort 3358) and keep the compact, efficient profile you aimed for. This change lets me cover something important on my side without introducing any large, heavy items. C10 isn’t a must-have for me, so I prefer this configuration as-is; if you strongly want C10, we can revisit which items to trade out, but I’d like to try this minimal swap first to lock things in quickly.'}
