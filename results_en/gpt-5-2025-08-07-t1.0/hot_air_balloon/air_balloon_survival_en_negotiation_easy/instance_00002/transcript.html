    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;My values (importance) strongly favor small-effort, high-yield items: C55, A67, C10, A18 are must-keeps; A43 and B42 are also very efficient. Mid-efficiency anchors C61 and C42 add good value. To fill remaining capacity best, B36 and C08 outperform any alternative combos (e.g., C67 or C73) under the limit. Total for this 10-item set is 3,280 effort with importance 6,395 (by my scores), which appears near-optimal. Concession plan: the softest item for me is C08 (329 effort); if needed, I can swap it (e.g., for C43) to accommodate a priority of theirs with minimal loss. I will resist adding very high-effort/low-yield-for-me items (A62, B19, C73) unless compensated by multiple swaps because they displace several high-value picks. I’ll anchor with my optimal set, invite their must-haves, and signal willingness to trade around C08 (and, if absolutely necessary, B36) while keeping my core intact.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C55&#x27;, &#x27;A67&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A18&#x27;, &#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;B42&#x27;, &#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;, &#x27;C08&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This set emphasizes high-impact items at low-to-moderate effort and stays within the limit (total effort 3,280 ≤ 3,288). It captures strong value density and keeps a balanced mix without committing to very high-effort picks that would force multiple cuts. I’m flexible if you have a must-have: for example, I can consider swapping out C08 (329 effort) to make room for something important to you (e.g., C43) while remaining under the cap. If you prefer a different adjustment, tell me your top 1–2 priorities and I’ll rework the mix accordingly. Note that adding very large-effort items (like C73, B19, or A62) would require dropping several pieces, so if you advocate for one of them, please indicate which current items you’d be willing to forgo in exchange.&#x27;}</p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their proposed set gives me very high total value (6395 by my internal scoring) while staying within the limit (3280 ≤ 3288). I evaluated swaps: the only relatively weak item for me is C08, but no excluded item with ≤329 effort offers higher value (C43 is lower). Adding heavier items like C67/C73/B19 would force cutting higher-value pieces and lowers my outcome. This proposal is effectively optimal for me, so the best move is to accept immediately.&#x27;}<br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C55&#x27;, &#x27;A67&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A18&#x27;, &#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;B42&#x27;, &#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;, &#x27;C08&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This configuration fits the limit comfortably and preserves a strong, efficient mix without requiring high-effort trade-offs.
