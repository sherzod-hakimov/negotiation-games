Mid{-}efficiency anchors C61 and C42 add good value. To fill remaining capacity best, B36 and C08 outperform any alternative combos (e.g., C67 or C73) under the limit. Total for this 10{-}item set is 3,280 effort with importance 6,395 (by my scores), which appears near{-}optimal. Concession plan: the softest item for me is C08 (329 effort); if needed, I can swap it (e.g., for C43) to accommodate a priority of theirs with minimal loss. I will resist adding very high{-}effort/low{-}yield{-}for{-}me items (A62, B19, C73) unless compensated by multiple swaps because they displace several high{-}value picks. I’ll anchor with my optimal set, invite their must{-}haves, and signal willingness to trade around C08 (and, if absolutely necessary, B36) while keeping my core intact.'\}} \\

I’m flexible if you have a must{-}have: for example, I can consider swapping out C08 (329 effort) to make room for something important to you (e.g., C43) while remaining under the cap.
