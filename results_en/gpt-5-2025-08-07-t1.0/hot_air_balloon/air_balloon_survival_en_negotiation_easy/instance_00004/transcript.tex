From there, the best larger additions are C61(687,668) and A67(919,822). With remaining room, small adds C43(47,121) and A62(111,65) fit. This set uses 3060 effort for total value 6348 to me, with 85 effort slack. I checked many swaps (e.g., substituting C73 or A18, dropping C10/B42) and none beat this value for me under the cap. Items I least want to include overall are C08 and B19 (low value to me per effort). If they strongly want C73, a possible concession is swapping A67→C73 (costly to me), so I’ll anchor on my best set but signal flexibility on small items (A62, C43) first. I’ll ask what they most need among excluded items (likely C73) and try to trade within the 85 slack or by replacing my least critical small items.'\}} \\
