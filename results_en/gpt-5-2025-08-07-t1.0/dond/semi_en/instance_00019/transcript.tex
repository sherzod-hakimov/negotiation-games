You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\\ \tt (c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: "[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]"\\ \tt (d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.
