I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7605. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make assumptions or strategies based on my own data.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nB21:369, B00:951, A08:156, A27:266, B94:581, B53:287, A23:866, C65:180, A89:800, B67:739, B45:637, C34:86, C12:749, A05:370, B60:345, C92:951, B69:147, A84:265, C06:262, B12:259, A16:358, B85:394, C35:286, B10:580, C15:479, B09:14, B16:153, C81:977, A58:134, C24:982, A30:259, A66:232, B75:202, B46:73, C70:821.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd B21: 369 \u2192 369\n\nB00: 951 \u2192 369+951=1320\n\nA08:156 \u2192 1476\n\nA27:266 \u2192 1742\n\nB94:581 \u2192 2323\n\nB53:287 \u2192 2610\n\nA23:866 \u2192 3476\n\nC65:180 \u2192 3656\n\nA89:800 \u2192 4456\n\nB67:739 \u2192 5195\n\nB45:637 \u2192 5832\n\nC34:86 \u2192 5918\n\nC12:749 \u2192 6667\n\nA05:370 \u2192 7037\n\nB60:345 \u2192 7382\n\nC92:951 \u2192 8333\n\nB69:147 \u2192 8480\n\nA84:265 \u2192 8745\n\nC06:262 \u2192 9007\n\nB12:259 \u2192 9266\n\nA16:358 \u2192 9624\n\nB85:394 \u2192 10018\n\nC35:286 \u2192 10304\n\nB10:580 \u2192 10884\n\nC15:479 \u2192 11363\n\nB09:14 \u2192 11377\n\nB16:153 \u2192 11530\n\nC81:977 \u2192 12507\n\nA58:134 \u2192 12641\n\nC24:982 \u2192 13623\n\nA30:259 \u2192 13882\n\nA66:232 \u2192 14114\n\nB75:202 \u2192 14316\n\nB46:73 \u2192 14389\n\nC70:821 \u2192 15210.\n\nTotal effort is 15210, which is way over the limit of 7605. So we can't take all items. Need to select a subset.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items where my importance is high, but also considering the effort. Since I don't know the other's importance, maybe I should focus on items where my importance is high relative to their effort. That way, even if the other person values them less, I can still get a good deal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize items with high importance for me and low effort. Let me calculate the importance per effort ratio for each item. That might help in selecting which items to propose.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFor each item, importance / effort.\n\nB21: 138 / 369 \u2248 0.374\n\nB00: 583 / 951 \u2248 0.613\n\nA08: 868 / 156 \u2248 5.564\n\nA27: 822 / 266 \u2248 3.090\n\nB94: 783 / 581 \u2248 1.348\n\nB53: 65 / 287 \u2248 0.226\n\nA23: 262 / 866 \u2248 0.302\n\nC65: 121 / 180 \u2248 0.672\n\nA89: 508 / 800 \u2248 0.635\n\nB67: 780 / 739 \u2248 1.056\n\nB45: 461 / 637 \u2248 0.724\n\nC34: 484 / 86 \u2248 5.628\n\nC12: 668 / 749 \u2248 0.892\n\nA05: 389 / 370 \u2248 1.051\n\nB60: 808 / 345 \u2248 2.342\n\nC92: 215 / 951 \u2248 0.226\n\nB69: 97 / 147 \u2248 0.659\n\nA84: 500 / 265 \u2248 1.887\n\nC06: 30 / 262 \u2248 0.114\n\nB12: 915 / 259 \u2248 3.533\n\nA16: 856 / 358 \u2248 2.391\n\nB85: 400 / 394 \u2248 1.015\n\nC35: 444 / 286 \u2248 1.552\n\nB10: 623 / 580 \u2248 1.074\n\nC15: 781 / 479 \u2248 1.631\n\nB09: 786 / 14 \u2248 56.143 (This is a huge ratio! B09 has very low effort and high importance for me.)\n\nB16: 3 / 153 \u2248 0.0196\n\nC81: 713 / 977 \u2248 0.730\n\nA58: 457 / 134 \u2248 3.410\n\nC24: 273 / 982 \u2248 0.278\n\nA30: 739 / 259 \u2248 2.853\n\nA66: 822 / 232 \u2248 3.543\n\nB75: 235 / 202 \u2248 1.163\n\nB46: 606 / 73 \u2248 8.301 (Another high ratio here.)\n\nC70: 968 / 821 \u2248 1.180\n\nSo the items with the highest importance per effort are B09 (56.14), B46 (8.301), A66 (3.543), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A08 (5.564), C34 (5.628), A30 (2.853), etc.\n\nThis suggests that B09 and B46 are very efficient for me. B09 has a very high ratio because its effort is only 14, and my importance is 786. That's a big win. Similarly, B46 has effort 73 and importance 606, which is also a good ratio.\n\nSo maybe I should start by proposing a set that includes these high ratio items. But I need to make sure the total effort doesn't exceed 7605.\n\nLet me try to build a proposal. Let's start with B09 (14), B46 (73), A66 (232), A16 (358), B60 (345), A08 (156), C34 (86), A30 (259), A58 (134), B75 (202), B12 (259), C15 (479), A27 (266), B94 (581), A84 (265), C12 (749), B67 (739), C70 (821), etc. Wait, but adding all these might exceed the limit. Let me calculate step by step.\n\nStart with B09 (14) \u2192 total 14\n\nAdd B46 (73) \u2192 87\n\nAdd A66 (232) \u2192 319\n\nAdd A16 (358) \u2192 677\n\nAdd B60 (345) \u2192 1022\n\nAdd A08 (156) \u2192 1178\n\nAdd C34 (86) \u2192 1264\n\nAdd A30 (259) \u2192 1523\n\nAdd A58 (134) \u2192 1657\n\nAdd B75 (202) \u2192 1859\n\nAdd B12 (259) \u2192 2118\n\nAdd C15 (479) \u2192 2597\n\nAdd A27 (266) \u2192 2863\n\nAdd B94 (581) \u2192 3444\n\nAdd A84 (265) \u2192 3709\n\nAdd C12 (749) \u2192 4458\n\nAdd B67 (739) \u2192 5197\n\nAdd C70 (821) \u2192 6018. Now, 6018 is under 7605. Let's see if we can add more.\n\nNext, maybe C81 (977) would take it to 6018+977=6995. Still under. Then maybe A23 (866) \u2192 6995+866=7861, which is over. So can't add that. What about C65 (180)? 6995+180=7175. Then maybe A23 (866) would be over. Alternatively, C24 (982) would be 6995+982=7977, over. So maybe add C65 (180) and C35 (286) \u2192 6995+180+286=7461. Then maybe B85 (394) \u2192 7461+394=7855, over. So maybe add C35 (286) and C65 (180) to reach 7461. Then maybe add B85 (394) would be over. Alternatively, check if there are other items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after 6018, add C81 (977) to get 6995. Then maybe add C35 (286) \u2192 7281. Then C65 (180) \u2192 7461. Then B85 (394) would be 7855, over. So maybe that's a possible set. But I need to check if this is the best possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. Let me think. The key is to maximize my importance. So I should prioritize items with high importance for me, even if their effort is higher, but only if the total effort allows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on items where my importance is high and the effort is low. For example, B09 (14 effort, 786 importance) is a must. Then B46 (73, 606). Then A66 (232, 822). Then A16 (358, 856). Then B60 (345, 808). Then A08 (156, 868). Then C34 (86, 484). Then A30 (259, 739). Then A58 (134, 457). Then B75 (202, 235). Then B12 (259, 915). Then C15 (479, 781). Then A27 (266, 822). Then B94 (581, 783). Then A84 (265, 500). Then C12 (749, 668). Then C70 (821, 968). Let me calculate the total effort here.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nB09:14 \u2192 14\n\nB46:73 \u2192 87\n\nA66:232 \u2192 319\n\nA16:358 \u2192 677\n\nB60:345 \u2192 1022\n\nA08:156 \u2192 1178\n\nC34:86 \u2192 1264\n\nA30:259 \u2192 1523\n\nA58:134 \u2192 1657\n\nB75:202 \u2192 1859\n\nB12:259 \u2192 2118\n\nC15:479 \u2192 2597\n\nA27:266 \u2192 2863\n\nB94:581 \u2192 3444\n\nA84:265 \u2192 3709\n\nC12:749 \u2192 4458\n\nC70:821 \u2192 5279.\n\nNow, 5279 is under 7605. Let's see if we can add more. Next, maybe C81 (977) \u2192 5279+977=6256. Then C35 (286) \u2192 6542. Then C65 (180) \u2192 6722. Then B85 (394) \u2192 7116. Then C24 (982) would be 7116+982=8098, over. So maybe add B85 (394) to reach 7116. Then maybe add C24 (982) is over. Alternatively, add C35 (286) and C65 (180) to 7116+286+180=7582. That's under 7605. Then maybe add B85 (394) would be 7582+394=7976, over. So the total effort here is 7582. That's a good set. The total importance for me would be:\n\nB09:786\n\nB46:606\n\nA66:822\n\nA16:856\n\nB60:808\n\nA08:868\n\nC34:484\n\nA30:739\n\nA58:457\n\nB75:235\n\nB12:915\n\nC15:781\n\nA27:822\n\nB94:783\n\nA84:500\n\nC12:668\n\nC70:968\n\nC81:713 (if added)\n\nC35:444\n\nC65:121\n\nWait, in the previous calculation, I added up to C70 (5279). Then adding C81 (977) would be 6256. Then C35 (286) \u2192 6542. Then C65 (180) \u2192 6722. Then B85 (394) \u2192 7116. Then C24 (982) is over. So maybe the set up to B85 (7116) is possible. But I need to check if that's the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I can include more high-importance items. Let me check the importance values again. The highest importance items for me are:\n\nB09:786\n\nB12:915\n\nC70:968\n\nA66:822\n\nA16:856\n\nA08:868\n\nC15:781\n\nB94:783\n\nA30:739\n\nA27:822\n\nB60:808\n\nA84:500\n\nC12:668\n\nB46:606\n\nA58:457\n\nC34:484\n\nB75:235\n\nB85:400\n\nC65:121\n\nC24:273\n\nC06:30\n\nB16:3\n\nB10:623\n\nC92:215\n\nA23:262\n\nB53:65\n\nC81:713\n\nSo the top items by importance are C70 (968), B12 (915), A66 (822), A16 (856), A08 (868), B94 (783), C15 (781), B09 (786), A30 (739), etc.\n\nSo the goal is to include as many of these high-importance items as possible within the effort limit.\n\nLet me try to build a set that includes the highest importance items first, then fill in with others.\n\nStart with C70 (821 effort, 968 importance). Then B12 (259, 915). Then A66 (232, 822). Then A16 (358, 856). Then A08 (156, 868). Then B94 (581, 783). Then C15 (479, 781). Then B09 (14, 786). Then A30 (259, 739). Then B60 (345, 808). Then C34 (86, 484). Then A58 (134, 457). Then B75 (202, 235). Then C12 (749, 668). Then A84 (265, 500). Then C81 (977, 713). Let's calculate the total effort here.\n\nC70:821\n\nB12:259 \u2192 1080\n\nA66:232 \u2192 1312\n\nA16:358 \u2192 1670\n\nA08:156 \u2192 1826\n\nB94:581 \u2192 2407\n\nC15:479 \u2192 2886\n\nB09:14 \u2192 2900\n\nA30:259 \u2192 3159\n\nB60:345 \u2192 3504\n\nC34:86 \u2192 3590\n\nA58:134 \u2192 3724\n\nB75:202 \u2192 3926\n\nC12:749 \u2192 4675\n\nA84:265 \u2192 4940\n\nC81:977 \u2192 5917.\n\nTotal effort is 5917, which is under 7605. Now, can we add more? Let's see. The remaining items are B46 (73), C65 (180), C24 (982), C06 (262), B85 (394), etc.\n\nAdding B46 (73) \u2192 5917+73=5990. Then C65 (180) \u2192 6170. Then C24 (982) would be 6170+982=7152. Then B85 (394) \u2192 7152+394=7546. Then C24 (982) would be over. So adding B46, C65, C24, B85 would bring total to 7546. Then maybe add C06 (262) \u2192 7546+262=7808, over. So the set up to B85 is 7546. That's a good set. The total importance would be:\n\nC70:968\n\nB12:915\n\nA66:822\n\nA16:856\n\nA08:868\n\nB94:783\n\nC15:781\n\nB09:786\n\nA30:739\n\nB60:808\n\nC34:484\n\nA58:457\n\nB75:235\n\nC12:668\n\nA84:500\n\nB46:606\n\nC65:121\n\nC24:273\n\nB85:400\n\nTotal importance: Let's add them up.\n\n968 + 915 = 1883\n\n+822 = 2705\n\n+856 = 3561\n\n+868 = 4429\n\n+783 = 5212\n\n+781 = 5993\n\n+786 = 6779\n\n+739 = 7518\n\n+808 = 8326\n\n+484 = 8810\n\n+457 = 9267\n\n+235 = 9502\n\n+668 = 10170\n\n+500 = 10670\n\n+606 = 11276\n\n+121 = 11397\n\n+273 = 11670\n\n+400 = 12070.\n\nThat's a total of 12,070 importance for me. But is this possible? The effort is 7546, which is under 7605. So this seems like a good set. However, I need to check if this is feasible. But since I can't know the other's importance, I have to assume that this set is good for me. However, the other person might have different priorities. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own strategy.\n\nBut the problem is that I need to propose a set. So my first proposal should be this set. However, the set is quite large. Let me check the exact items included:\n\nC70, B12, A66, A16, A08, B94, C15, B09, A30, B60, C34, A58, B75, C12, A84, B46, C65, C24, B85.\n\nWait, that's 19 items. Let me count again:\n\n1. C70\n\n2. B12\n\n3. A66\n\n4. A16\n\n5. A08\n\n6. B94\n\n7. C15\n\n8. B09\n\n9. A30\n\n10. B60\n\n11. C34\n\n12. A58\n\n13. B75\n\n14. C12\n\n15. A84\n\n16. B46\n\n17. C65\n\n18. C24\n\n19. B85\n\nYes, 19 items. The total effort is 7546. That's under 7605. So this is a valid proposal. But maybe I can add more items. Let's see. The remaining items are C06 (262), B16 (153), B10 (580), C92 (951), A23 (866), B53 (287), C81 (977), etc.\n\nAdding C06 (262) would make total effort 7546+262=7808, which is over. So no. What about B16 (153)? 7546+153=7699, over. B10 (580) would be 7546+580=8126, over. C92 (951) is way over. A23 (866) would be 7546+866=8412, over. B53 (287) \u2192 7546+287=7833, over. C81 (977) \u2192 7546+977=8523, over. So no more items can be added. So this set is valid.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some lower importance items to include others. But since I don't know the other's importance, it's hard to say. However, my goal is to maximize my own importance, so this set seems good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can replace some items. For example, if I remove C24 (273 effort, 273 importance) and add C81 (977 effort, 713 importance). But 273 vs 977 effort. The difference is 704 effort. But 7546 - 273 = 7273. Then adding C81 (977) would be 7273+977=8250, which is over. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe replace some items. But this might not be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe include B10 (580 effort, 623 importance). If I add B10 to the current set, the effort would be 7546+580=8126, which is over. So no.\n\nSo the set I have is valid. Now, I need to propose this set. But the problem is that the other person might have different importance values. For example, if they value C81 highly, they might want to include it. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own strategy.\n\nSo my first proposal would be this set. However, the set is quite large. Maybe I should start with a smaller set and negotiate. But the user's instruction says that I can propose any set, as long as it's within the limit. So I can propose this set.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted. The proposal should be a set of item names. Let me list them:\n\n{'C70', 'B12', 'A66', 'A16', 'A08', 'B94', 'C15', 'B09', 'A30', 'B60', 'C34', 'A58', 'B75', 'C12', 'A84', 'B46', 'C65', 'C24', 'B85'}\n\nBut I need to check if all these items are in the original list. Yes, they are. Now, the total effort is 7546, which is under 7605. So this is a valid proposal.\n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a way to include more items. For example, if I remove some items with lower importance but higher effort. For instance, C24 (273 effort, 273 importance) and C65 (180, 121). If I remove them, I can add other items. But without knowing the other's importance, it's hard to say. However, since my goal is to maximize my own importance, removing these might not be beneficial. For example, C24 has 273 importance, which is not as high as others. So keeping them is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add B10 (580 effort, 623 importance). But adding B10 would require removing some items. For example, if I remove C24 (273) and C65 (180), total effort saved is 273+180=453. Then adding B10 (580) would require 453+580=1033, which is more than the saved 453. So that's not possible. So it's not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the proposed set seems optimal for my own importance. Now, I need to present this as a PROPOSAL. But I should also include an ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING.\n\nThe STRATEGIC REASONING should explain my approach. For example, I prioritized items with high importance for me and low effort, calculated the importance per effort ratio, and selected the top items to maximize my total importance within the limit.\n\nThe ARGUMENT could be that this set maximizes my importance by including high-value items with manageable effort.\n\nSo the message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I calculated the importance per effort ratio for each item and selected the top items to maximize my total importance within the effort limit. This set includes high-importance items like B09 (786) and B46 (606) with low effort, ensuring efficient use of the limit.\n\nARGUMENT: This proposal includes items with the highest importance for me, balancing effort to stay under 7605.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'C70', 'B12', 'A66', 'A16', 'A08', 'B94', 'C15', 'B09', 'A30', 'B60', 'C34', 'A58', 'B75', 'C12', 'A84', 'B46', 'C65', 'C24', 'B85'}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted. Also, the user might have a different strategy, but this is my best approach given the information.\n",

Also, the ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL need to follow correctly. \n\nIn my first attempt, I had STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. But maybe the order is okay as long as STRATEGIC REASONING is first. Wait, the user's error message says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So the first thing in the message should be that tag. \n\nLet me restructure my response. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL.

So the proposal should have unique items. So the correct set should have each item once. Let me recalculate the effort without duplicates. \n\nB09 (14), B46 (73), A66 (232), A16 (358), A08 (156), B94 (581), C15 (781), A30 (259), B60 (345), C34 (86), A58 (134), B75 (202), C12 (749), A84 (265), C65 (121), C24 (982). \n\nAdding these up: 14+73=87, +232=319, +358=677, +156=833, +581=1414, +781=2195, +259=2454, +345=2799, +86=2885, +134=3019, +202=3221, +749=3970, +265=4235, +121=4356, +982=5338.

It includes key high-value items while avoiding excessive effort that could limit flexibility.  \n\nPROPOSAL: {'B09', 'B46', 'A66', 'A16', 'A08', 'B94', 'C15', 'A30', 'B60', 'C34', 'A58', 'B75', 'C12', 'A84', 'C65', 'C24'}",
