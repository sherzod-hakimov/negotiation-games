I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7868. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nB21:552, B00:560, A08:76, A27:950, B94:248, B53:871, A23:391, C65:143, A89:293, B67:208, B45:678, C34:737, C12:407, A05:366, B60:768, C92:859, B69:183, A84:231, C06:305, B12:727, A16:148, B85:357, C35:504, B10:549, C15:299, B09:91, B16:527, C81:848, A58:307, C24:214, A30:723, A66:475, B75:23, B46:298, C70:820.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd B21: 552 \u2192 552\n\nB00: 560 \u2192 552+560=1112\n\nA08:76 \u2192 1188\n\nA27:950 \u2192 2138\n\nB94:248 \u2192 2386\n\nB53:871 \u2192 3257\n\nA23:391 \u2192 3648\n\nC65:143 \u2192 3791\n\nA89:293 \u2192 4084\n\nB67:208 \u2192 4292\n\nB45:678 \u2192 4970\n\nC34:737 \u2192 5707\n\nC12:407 \u2192 6114\n\nA05:366 \u2192 6480\n\nB60:768 \u2192 7248\n\nC92:859 \u2192 8107 (Wait, this is already over 7868. So the total effort of all items is 8107, which exceeds the limit. So we can't take all items. Therefore, we need to select a subset.\n\nSo the challenge is to pick items that sum to <=7868, and maximize my importance. Since I don't know the other's importance, I need to focus on my own. But in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. However, since I can't know theirs, maybe I should aim for a set that's valuable to me and has a reasonable effort, leaving room for possible compromises.\n\nBut how to approach this? Maybe start by selecting high-importance items for me, but with lower effort. Alternatively, find a balance between high importance and low effort.\n\nLet me list my items sorted by importance per effort ratio. That might help in selecting items that give the most value per unit of effort. Let's calculate that.\n\nFor each item, importance / effort:\n\nB21:138/552 \u2248 0.25\n\nB00:583/560 \u2248 1.04\n\nA08:868/76 \u2248 11.42 (very high)\n\nA27:822/950 \u2248 0.865\n\nB94:783/248 \u2248 3.16\n\nB53:65/871 \u2248 0.075 (low)\n\nA23:262/391 \u2248 0.67\n\nC65:121/143 \u2248 0.85\n\nA89:508/293 \u2248 1.73\n\nB67:780/208 \u2248 3.75\n\nB45:461/678 \u2248 0.68\n\nC34:484/737 \u2248 0.656\n\nC12:668/407 \u2248 1.64\n\nA05:389/366 \u2248 1.06\n\nB60:808/768 \u2248 1.05\n\nC92:215/859 \u2248 0.25\n\nB69:97/183 \u2248 0.53\n\nA84:500/231 \u2248 2.16\n\nC06:30/305 \u2248 0.098\n\nB12:915/727 \u2248 1.26\n\nA16:856/148 \u2248 5.78 (very high)\n\nB85:400/357 \u2248 1.12\n\nC35:444/504 \u2248 0.88\n\nB10:623/549 \u2248 1.13\n\nC15:781/299 \u2248 2.61\n\nB09:786/91 \u2248 8.64 (very high)\n\nB16:3/527 \u2248 0.0057 (extremely low)\n\nC81:713/848 \u2248 0.84\n\nA58:457/307 \u2248 1.49\n\nC24:273/214 \u2248 1.28\n\nA30:739/723 \u2248 1.02\n\nA66:822/475 \u2248 1.73\n\nB75:235/23 \u2248 10.22 (extremely high)\n\nB46:606/298 \u2248 2.03\n\nC70:105/820 \u2248 0.128\n\nSo the highest ratios are A08 (11.42), B09 (8.64), B75 (10.22), A16 (5.78), B67 (3.75), B94 (3.16), A84 (2.16), C15 (2.61), B46 (2.03), A66 (1.73), A05 (1.06), B60 (1.05), C12 (1.64), A30 (1.02), B12 (1.26), C24 (1.28), A89 (1.73), etc.\n\nSo the top items by importance per effort are A08, B09, B75, A16, B67, B94, A84, C15, B46, A66, etc.\n\nBut since the total effort is limited, I need to pick a combination that adds up to <=7868. Let's try to select the highest ratio items first.\n\nStart with A08 (76 effort, 868 importance). Then B09 (91 effort, 786). Then B75 (23 effort, 235). Then A16 (148 effort, 856). Then B67 (208 effort, 780). Then B94 (248 effort, 783). Then A84 (231 effort, 500). Then C15 (299 effort, 781). Then B46 (298 effort, 606). Then A66 (475 effort, 822). Let's add these up:\n\nA08:76 \u2192 total 76\n\nB09:91 \u2192 167\n\nB75:23 \u2192 190\n\nA16:148 \u2192 338\n\nB67:208 \u2192 546\n\nB94:248 \u2192 794\n\nA84:231 \u2192 1025\n\nC15:299 \u2192 1324\n\nB46:298 \u2192 1622\n\nA66:475 \u2192 2097\n\nTotal effort so far: 2097. That's way under 7868. So maybe add more items. Let's check other high ratio items. Next could be C12 (407 effort, 668). Adding that: 2097+407=2504. Then A30 (723 effort, 739). 2504+723=3227. Then B12 (727 effort, 915). 3227+727=3954. Then C24 (214 effort, 273). 3954+214=4168. Then A58 (307 effort, 457). 4168+307=4475. Then B85 (357 effort, 400). 4475+357=4832. Then C35 (504 effort, 444). 4832+504=5336. Then C65 (143 effort, 121). 5336+143=5479. Then A23 (391 effort, 262). 5479+391=5870. Then B10 (549 effort, 623). 5870+549=6419. Then C34 (737 effort, 484). 6419+737=7156. Then A27 (950 effort, 822). 7156+950=8106. Oh, that's over the limit. So can't add A27. So maybe stop before that. Let's see, after 7156, adding A27 would be 7156+950=8106 which is over. So maybe instead of A27, add other items. Let's check the remaining items. What's left? Let's see:\n\nOriginal list: all items. So far, we have A08, B09, B75, A16, B67, B94, A84, C15, B46, A66, C12, A30, B12, C24, A58, B85, C35, C65, A23, B10, C34. That's 21 items. The remaining items are B21, B00, C92, C06, B60, C81, B69, B53, C70. Let's check their effort and importance.\n\nB21:552 effort, 138 importance. B00:560, 583. C92:859, 215. C06:305, 30. B60:768, 808. C81:848, 713. B69:183, 97. B53:871, 65. C70:820, 105.\n\nSo adding B21 would add 552 effort. Current total is 7156. 7156+552=7708. That's under 7868. So adding B21 would be possible. Then total effort 7708. Then maybe add B00 (560) \u2192 7708+560=8268 which is over. So can't. What about B60? 768 effort. 7708+768=8476 over. C92:859 \u2192 7708+859=8567 over. C06:305 \u2192 7708+305=8013 over. B69:183 \u2192 7708+183=7891 over. B53:871 \u2192 way over. C70:820 \u2192 over. So only B21 can be added. So adding B21 would bring total to 7708. Then maybe add other items with lower effort. For example, C06 (305) is too much. B69 (183) would make 7708+183=7891 over. So no. So after adding B21, total is 7708. Then maybe add C06? No. What about B69? 183. 7708+183=7891 over. So no. So maybe that's the maximum. But wait, maybe there's a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some items with lower effort but higher importance. For example, B75 is already included. What about B09? Already included. What about B16? It's very low importance per effort, so not worth. So the current set is 21 items, total effort 7156. Adding B21 brings it to 7708. Then maybe add C06? No. So total effort 7708. Then maybe add B69? 183. 7708+183=7891 over. So no. So the maximum possible is 7708. But maybe there's a better combination. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not taking some of the higher effort items to include others. For example, if I don't take A66 (475 effort), maybe I can take more items. But A66 has a high importance (822) and effort 475. So it's a good item. Alternatively, maybe replace some items. But this is getting complicated. Since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on including as many high-importance items as possible, even if they have higher effort, as long as the total is under the limit.\n\nBut since I can't know the other's importance, maybe the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest importance items for me, even if they have higher effort, but ensuring the total is under the limit. However, in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own data.\n\nSo the initial proposal could be a set of high-importance items. Let me try to create a proposal. Let's start with the highest importance items for me. Let's list all items sorted by my importance:\n\nLooking at my importance values:\n\nA08:868 (highest)\n\nA27:822\n\nA66:822\n\nB00:583\n\nA89:508\n\nB67:780\n\nB94:783\n\nC15:781\n\nB12:915\n\nA16:856\n\nB46:606\n\nA30:739\n\nB10:623\n\nC34:484\n\nA58:457\n\nB85:400\n\nC65:121\n\nA23:262\n\nB60:808\n\nC24:273\n\nA84:500\n\nB69:97\n\nB09:786\n\nB75:235\n\nB21:138\n\nC92:215\n\nC06:30\n\nB53:65\n\nC70:105\n\nSo the top items by my importance are A08 (868), A27 (822), A66 (822), B00 (583), B67 (780), B94 (783), C15 (781), B12 (915), A16 (856), B46 (606), A30 (739), B10 (623), C34 (484), A58 (457), B85 (400), C65 (121), A23 (262), B60 (808), C24 (273), A84 (500), B69 (97), B21 (138), C92 (215), C06 (30), B53 (65), C70 (105).\n\nSo the highest importance items are A08, A27, A66, B00, B67, B94, C15, B12, A16, B46, A30, B10, etc.\n\nBut including all of these would exceed the effort limit. So need to select a subset.\n\nLet me try to create a proposal. Let's start with the highest importance items and add them until the effort is under 7868.\n\nStart with A08 (76), A27 (950), A66 (475), B00 (560), B67 (208), B94 (248), C15 (299), B12 (727), A16 (148), B46 (298), A30 (723), B10 (549), C34 (737), A58 (307), B85 (357), C65 (143), A23 (391), B60 (768), C24 (214), A84 (231), B69 (183), B21 (552), C92 (859), C06 (305), B53 (871), C70 (820).\n\nBut adding all these would be way over. So need to pick a subset.\n\nLet me try to add the highest importance items first, but check the effort.\n\nStart with A08 (76). Then A27 (950) \u2192 total 76+950=1026. Then A66 (475) \u2192 1026+475=1501. Then B00 (560) \u2192 1501+560=2061. Then B67 (208) \u2192 2269. B94 (248) \u2192 2517. C15 (299) \u2192 2816. B12 (727) \u2192 3543. A16 (148) \u2192 3691. B46 (298) \u2192 3989. A30 (723) \u2192 4712. B10 (549) \u2192 5261. C34 (737) \u2192 5998. A58 (307) \u2192 6305. B85 (357) \u2192 6662. C65 (143) \u2192 6805. A23 (391) \u2192 7196. B60 (768) \u2192 7964. Oh, that's over 7868. So can't add B60. So stop at 7196. Then maybe add B21 (552) \u2192 7196+552=7748. Then maybe add C06 (305) \u2192 7748+305=8053 over. So no. So the set would be up to A23, total effort 7196. Then adding B21 brings it to 7748. Then maybe add B69 (183) \u2192 7748+183=7931 over. So no. So the set would be A08, A27, A66, B00, B67, B94, C15, B12, A16, B46, A30, B10, C34, A58, B85, C65, A23, B21. Total effort 7748. That's under 7868. The total importance for me would be:\n\nA08:868\n\nA27:822\n\nA66:822\n\nB00:583\n\nB67:780\n\nB94:783\n\nC15:781\n\nB12:915\n\nA16:856\n\nB46:606\n\nA30:739\n\nB10:623\n\nC34:484\n\nA58:457\n\nB85:400\n\nC65:121\n\nA23:262\n\nB21:138\n\nAdding these up:\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n868 + 822 = 1690\n\n+822 = 2512\n\n+583 = 3095\n\n+780 = 3875\n\n+783 = 4658\n\n+781 = 5439\n\n+915 = 6354\n\n+856 = 7210\n\n+606 = 7816\n\n+739 = 8555\n\n+623 = 9178\n\n+484 = 9662\n\n+457 = 10119\n\n+400 = 10519\n\n+121 = 10640\n\n+262 = 10902\n\n+138 = 11040.\n\nSo total importance is 11040. That's a lot. But is this possible? The effort is 7748, which is under 7868. So this is a valid proposal. But maybe there's a way to include more items. For example, after 7748, can we add B69 (183) \u2192 7748+183=7931 over. No. What about C06 (305)? 7748+305=8053 over. So no. What about C92 (859)? 7748+859=8607 over. So no. So this set is valid. But maybe there's a better combination. For example, if we exclude some items with lower importance but higher effort, and include others. But since I don't know the other's importance, it's hard to say. However, my goal is to maximize my own importance, so this set seems good.\n\nBut in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. For example, they might value items that I don't. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own data.\n\nSo the first step is to propose this set. However, the problem is that the other person might refuse, and then I need to adjust. But since I need to start with a proposal, I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other person has a different set of high importance items. But without knowing, I can't adjust. So the best I can do is propose a set that maximizes my own importance under the effort limit.\n\nAnother approach is to use a knapsack algorithm to find the optimal set for me. But since I can't compute that here, I have to approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other person's proposal might include items that I don't value as much, so I need to negotiate. But since I have to start with a proposal, I should make a strong one.\n\nSo the initial proposal would be the set I calculated above. But let me check the effort again. Let me recount:\n\nA08:76\n\nA27:950 \u2192 76+950=1026\n\nA66:475 \u2192 1026+475=1501\n\nB00:560 \u2192 1501+560=2061\n\nB67:208 \u2192 2061+208=2269\n\nB94:248 \u2192 2269+248=2517\n\nC15:299 \u2192 2517+299=2816\n\nB12:727 \u2192 2816+727=3543\n\nA16:148 \u2192 3543+148=3691\n\nB46:298 \u2192 3691+298=3989\n\nA30:723 \u2192 3989+723=4712\n\nB10:549 \u2192 4712+549=5261\n\nC34:737 \u2192 5261+737=5998\n\nA58:307 \u2192 5998+307=6305\n\nB85:357 \u2192 6305+357=6662\n\nC65:143 \u2192 6662+143=6805\n\nA23:391 \u2192 6805+391=7196\n\nB21:552 \u2192 7196+552=7748\n\nTotal effort: 7748. That's under 7868. So this is a valid proposal. The total importance is 11040. That's a good set. But maybe there's a way to add more items. For example, after 7748, can I add B69 (183)? 7748+183=7931 over. No. What about C06 (305)? 7748+305=8053 over. So no. What about C92 (859)? 7748+859=8607 over. So no. So this is the maximum I can get. So this is a good proposal.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some items with lower importance but higher effort, and include others. For example, if I don't take A27 (950 effort, 822 importance), maybe I can take other items. But A27 is a high importance item. So it's better to include it. Similarly for A66 (822 importance, 475 effort). So including them is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, if I take B75 (23 effort, 235 importance) instead of some other items. But B75's importance is 235, which is lower than some others. So it's not as good. So the current set seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, the first proposal should be this set. However, the problem is that the other person might have different importance values. For example, they might value C92 highly, which I don't. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own data.\n\nSo the first message should be a PROPOSAL with this set. Then, depending on the other's response, I can adjust. But since the user is asking for the first message, I need to generate the initial proposal.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING in each message. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden. So in the first message, I need to include STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, and the ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will propose a set of items that maximizes my own importance while staying under the effort limit. I prioritize items with high importance and low effort, and include as many high-importance items as possible without exceeding the limit.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A08', 'A27', 'A66', 'B00', 'B67', 'B94', 'C15', 'B12', 'A16', 'B46', 'A30', 'B10', 'C34', 'A58', 'B85', 'C65', 'A23', 'B21'}\n\nARGUMENT: This proposal includes the highest importance items for me, ensuring maximum value while keeping the total effort under the limit. The total effort is 7748, which is within the 7868 limit.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted as a Python set. Also, check if all items are present. Let me verify the items in the proposal:\n\nA08, A27, A66, B00, B67, B94, C15, B12, A16, B46, A30, B10, C34, A58, B85, C65, A23, B21. That's 18 items. The effort sum is 7748, which is under 7868. So this is valid.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to include more items. For example, after 7748, can I add B69 (183)? 7748+183=7931 over. No. What about C06 (305)? 7748+305=8053 over. So no. What about C92 (859)? 7748+859=8607 over. So no. So this is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, if I remove A27 (950 effort) and add B75 (23 effort) and others. But A27's importance is 822, which is higher than B75's 235. So it's better to keep A27. So the current set is better.\n\nTherefore, the initial proposal is as above. Now, the next step is to write the message with the required formats. The STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden, so the other person won't see it. The ARGUMENT is visible, so I need to explain why I chose this set.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will propose a set of items that maximizes my own importance while staying under the effort limit. I prioritize items with high importance and low effort, and include as many high-importance items as possible without exceeding the limit.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A08', 'A27', 'A66', 'B00', 'B67', 'B94', 'C15', 'B12', 'A16', 'B46', 'A30', 'B10', 'C34', 'A58', 'B85', 'C65', 'A23', 'B21'}\n\nARGUMENT: This proposal includes the highest importance items for me, ensuring maximum value while keeping the total effort under the limit. The total effort is 7748, which is within the 7868 limit.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted. Also, check if all items are present. Let me count the items again. Yes, 18 items. The effort sum is 7748. Correct.\n\nNow, the other person might refuse this proposal. Then I need to adjust. But for the first message, this is the initial proposal. The user's task is to generate the first message. So this would be the first step.\n",
