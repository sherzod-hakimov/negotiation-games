    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 9475. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>B21:944, B00:568, A08:515, A27:239, B94:876, B53:421, A23:991, C65:281, A89:788, B67:678, B45:432, C34:409, C12:279, A05:506, B60:101, C92:686, B69:851, A84:854, C06:133, B12:192, A16:573, B85:17, C35:465, B10:772, C15:46, B09:501, B16:220, C81:404, A58:843, C24:748, A30:552, A66:843, B75:947, B46:345, C70:930.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step. Let me start adding:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add B21: 944 → total 944<br/><br/>B00: 568 → 944+568=1512<br/><br/>A08:515 → 1512+515=2027<br/><br/>A27:239 → 2027+239=2266<br/><br/>B94:876 → 2266+876=3142<br/><br/>B53:421 → 3142+421=3563<br/><br/>A23:991 → 3563+991=4554<br/><br/>C65:281 → 4554+281=4835<br/><br/>A89:788 → 4835+788=5623<br/><br/>B67:678 → 5623+678=6301<br/><br/>B45:432 → 6301+432=6733<br/><br/>C34:409 → 6733+409=7142<br/><br/>C12:279 → 7142+279=7421<br/><br/>A05:506 → 7421+506=7927<br/><br/>B60:101 → 7927+101=8028<br/><br/>C92:686 → 8028+686=8714<br/><br/>B69:851 → 8714+851=9565 → Oh, this is over 9475. So adding B69 would exceed the limit. So the total effort of all items is 9565, which is over the limit. Therefore, we can&#x27;t take all items. So we need to select a subset.<br/><br/>So the first step is to figure out which items to include. Since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should prioritize items with high importance relative to their effort. That is, items where importance/effort ratio is high. This is similar to the knapsack problem where you maximize value per weight.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. Let&#x27;s list them:<br/><br/>B21: 138/944 ≈ 0.146<br/><br/>B00: 583/568 ≈ 1.026<br/><br/>A08: 868/515 ≈ 1.685<br/><br/>A27: 822/239 ≈ 3.439<br/><br/>B94: 783/876 ≈ 0.894<br/><br/>B53: 65/421 ≈ 0.154<br/><br/>A23: 262/991 ≈ 0.265<br/><br/>C65: 121/281 ≈ 0.430<br/><br/>A89: 508/788 ≈ 0.645<br/><br/>B67: 780/678 ≈ 1.149<br/><br/>B45: 461/432 ≈ 1.067<br/><br/>C34: 484/409 ≈ 1.183<br/><br/>C12: 668/279 ≈ 2.394<br/><br/>A05: 389/506 ≈ 0.769<br/><br/>B60: 808/101 ≈ 8.0 (very high)<br/><br/>C92: 215/686 ≈ 0.313<br/><br/>B69: 97/851 ≈ 0.114<br/><br/>A84: 500/854 ≈ 0.586<br/><br/>C06: 30/133 ≈ 0.226<br/><br/>B12: 915/192 ≈ 4.766<br/><br/>A16: 856/573 ≈ 1.494<br/><br/>B85: 400/17 ≈ 23.529 (extremely high)<br/><br/>C35: 444/465 ≈ 0.955<br/><br/>B10: 623/772 ≈ 0.807<br/><br/>C15: 781/46 ≈ 16.978 (very high)<br/><br/>B09: 786/501 ≈ 1.569<br/><br/>B16: 3/220 ≈ 0.014<br/><br/>C81: 713/404 ≈ 1.765<br/><br/>A58: 457/843 ≈ 0.542<br/><br/>C24: 273/748 ≈ 0.365<br/><br/>A30: 739/552 ≈ 1.339<br/><br/>A66: 822/843 ≈ 0.975<br/><br/>B75: 235/947 ≈ 0.248<br/><br/>B46: 606/345 ≈ 1.757<br/><br/>C70: 968/930 ≈ 1.041<br/><br/>So the highest ratios are B85 (23.5), C15 (16.98), B12 (4.77), A27 (3.44), B60 (8.0), etc. <br/><br/>So the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most bang for the effort. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 9475. Let&#x27;s start building a set by adding the highest ratio items first.<br/><br/>Start with B85 (effort 17, importance 400). Then C15 (effort 46, importance 781). Then B12 (effort 192, importance 915). Then A27 (effort 239, importance 822). Then B60 (effort 101, importance 808). Then C34 (effort 409, importance 484). Then B67 (effort 678, importance 780). Then A08 (effort 515, importance 868). Then B00 (effort 568, importance 583). Then A30 (effort 552, importance 739). Then A66 (effort 843, importance 822). Then B46 (effort 345, importance 606). Then C70 (effort 930, importance 968). Then A58 (effort 843, importance 457). Then C81 (effort 404, importance 713). Then B10 (effort 772, importance 623). Then C24 (effort 748, importance 273). Then A16 (effort 573, importance 856). Then B09 (effort 501, importance 786). Then C06 (effort 133, importance 30). Then B69 (effort 851, importance 97). Then B53 (effort 421, importance 65). Then C65 (effort 281, importance 121). Then A23 (effort 991, importance 262). Then B21 (effort 944, importance 138). Then B75 (effort 947, importance 235). Then B45 (effort 432, importance 461). Then C92 (effort 686, importance 215). <br/><br/>Wait, but adding all these would definitely exceed the limit. So I need to calculate the cumulative effort as I add each item. Let&#x27;s start adding step by step:<br/><br/>1. B85 (17) → total 17<br/>2. C15 (46) → 17+46=63<br/>3. B12 (192) → 63+192=255<br/>4. A27 (239) → 255+239=494<br/>5. B60 (101) → 494+101=595<br/>6. C34 (409) → 595+409=1004<br/>7. B67 (678) → 1004+678=1682<br/>8. A08 (515) → 1682+515=2197<br/>9. B00 (568) → 2197+568=2765<br/>10. A30 (552) → 2765+552=3317<br/>11. A66 (843) → 3317+843=4160<br/>12. B46 (345) → 4160+345=4505<br/>13. C70 (930) → 4505+930=5435<br/>14. A58 (843) → 5435+843=6278<br/>15. C81 (404) → 6278+404=6682<br/>16. B10 (772) → 6682+772=7454<br/>17. C24 (748) → 7454+748=8202<br/>18. A16 (573) → 8202+573=8775<br/>19. B09 (501) → 8775+501=9276<br/>20. C06 (133) → 9276+133=9409<br/>21. B69 (851) → 9409+851=10260 → exceeds limit. So can&#x27;t add B69.<br/><br/>So up to step 20, total effort is 9409. Then adding B69 would go over. So the next item after 20 is B69, which is too much. So maybe we can add some other items instead. Let&#x27;s check the remaining items. After step 20, the remaining items are B69, B53, C65, A23, B21, B75, B45, C92. <br/><br/>Wait, but maybe there are other items with lower effort that can be added. For example, B53 (421) is next. Let&#x27;s see: 9409 + 421 = 9830, which is over. So no. C65 (281): 9409+281=9690, over. A23 (991): 9409+991=10400, over. B21 (944): 9409+944=10353, over. B75 (947): 9409+947=10356, over. B45 (432): 9409+432=9841, over. C92 (686): 9409+686=10095, over. So none of the remaining items can be added without exceeding the limit. <br/><br/>So the maximum set we can get is up to step 20, which is 9409 effort. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, maybe replacing some items with others to get a higher total importance. <br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the initial selection is not optimal. Let me check if there&#x27;s a better way. For example, maybe some items with lower ratios but higher importance could be included if they fit. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct, but I need to check if there&#x27;s a way to include more items by adjusting the order. <br/><br/>But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items up to the limit. <br/><br/>So the proposed set would be: B85, C15, B12, A27, B60, C34, B67, A08, B00, A30, A66, B46, C70, A58, C81, B10, C24, A16, B09, C06. <br/><br/>Let me check the total effort again. <br/><br/>Calculating step by step:<br/><br/>B85:17<br/><br/>C15:46 → 63<br/><br/>B12:192 → 255<br/><br/>A27:239 → 494<br/><br/>B60:101 → 595<br/><br/>C34:409 → 1004<br/><br/>B67:678 → 1682<br/><br/>A08:515 → 2197<br/><br/>B00:568 → 2765<br/><br/>A30:552 → 3317<br/><br/>A66:843 → 4160<br/><br/>B46:345 → 4505<br/><br/>C70:930 → 5435<br/><br/>A58:843 → 6278<br/><br/>C81:404 → 6682<br/><br/>B10:772 → 7454<br/><br/>C24:748 → 8202<br/><br/>A16:573 → 8775<br/><br/>B09:501 → 9276<br/><br/>C06:133 → 9409<br/><br/>Total effort: 9409, which is under 9475. <br/><br/>Now, the total importance for this set would be:<br/><br/>B85:400<br/><br/>C15:781 → 1181<br/><br/>B12:915 → 2096<br/><br/>A27:822 → 2918<br/><br/>B60:808 → 3726<br/><br/>C34:484 → 4210<br/><br/>B67:780 → 4990<br/><br/>A08:868 → 5858<br/><br/>B00:583 → 6441<br/><br/>A30:739 → 7180<br/><br/>A66:822 → 8002<br/><br/>B46:606 → 8608<br/><br/>C70:968 → 9576<br/><br/>A58:457 → 10033<br/><br/>C81:713 → 10746<br/><br/>B10:623 → 11369<br/><br/>C24:273 → 11642<br/><br/>A16:856 → 12498<br/><br/>B09:786 → 13284<br/><br/>C06:30 → 13314<br/><br/>So total importance is 13314. <br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items. For example, after step 20 (9409), maybe we can add some items with lower effort. Let&#x27;s see. The remaining items are B69 (851), B53 (421), C65 (281), A23 (991), B21 (944), B75 (947), B45 (432), C92 (686). <br/><br/>The effort left is 9475 - 9409 = 66. So we can only add items with effort ≤66. Looking at the remaining items, none of them have effort ≤66. The smallest is B53 (421), which is way over. So no. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe we can remove some items to make room for others. For example, if we remove a high effort item and add a lower one. But since the goal is to maximize my own importance, it&#x27;s better to keep the high importance items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial selection is optimal. <br/><br/>So the proposal would be the set of items up to step 20. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that this set is within the limit. 9409 is under 9475. So that&#x27;s acceptable. <br/><br/>Now, the next step is to propose this set. But I need to structure the message with the PROPOSAL tag. <br/><br/>But before that, I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING. <br/><br/>The STRATEGIC REASONING should be at the beginning of the message. <br/><br/>So the message would start with STRATEGIC REASONING: ... <br/><br/>Then the ARGUMENT: ... <br/><br/>Then the PROPOSAL: ... <br/><br/>So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance within the limit. By selecting items like B85 (high ratio) and C15, I aim to accumulate high value while keeping effort low. This approach ensures efficient use of the limited effort budget.<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: I selected items with the highest importance/effort ratios to maximize my total importance. This includes B85, C15, B12, A27, B60, etc., which offer the best value per unit of effort.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;B85&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;A27&#x27;, &#x27;B60&#x27;, &#x27;C34&#x27;, &#x27;B67&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B00&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;A58&#x27;, &#x27;C81&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;C06&#x27;}<br/><br/>But I need to check if this set is correct. Let me verify the effort again. <br/><br/>Yes, as calculated, it&#x27;s 9409. <br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if I remove some items and add others. For instance, if I remove C06 (133 effort, 30 importance) and add B53 (421 effort, 65 importance). But 9409 -133 = 9276, then adding B53 would be 9276+421=9697, which is over. So no. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replace C06 with B53. But that would require removing C06 (133) and adding B53 (421). The net effort would be 9409 -133 +421 = 9697, which is over. So not possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove a higher effort item. For example, remove A66 (843) and add B53 (421). The effort would be 9409 -843 +421 = 9409 -422 = 8987. Then add B53. But then the total effort is 8987 +421=9408. Then maybe add another item. But this might not be better. <br/><br/>The importance would change: removing A66 (822) and adding B53 (65). So total importance would be 13314 -822 +65 = 12557. Which is worse. So not a good trade. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove a lower importance item. For example, remove C06 (30) and add B53 (65). The effort would be 9409 -133 +421 = 9697, which is over. So no. <br/><br/>So the initial proposal seems optimal. <br/><br/>Therefore, the first message would be the STRATEGIC REASONING, ARGUMENT, and PROPOSAL as above. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the PROPOSAL is a valid set. Also, the other participant might refuse, but that&#x27;s part of the negotiation. <br/><br/>So the first message is structured correctly. <br/><br/>Now, the user&#x27;s instruction says that the first message must include STRATEGIC REASONING, ARGUMENT, and PROPOSAL. <br/><br/>So the first response should be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: [reasoning]<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: [argument]<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: [set]<br/><br/>Then, the other participant would respond. <br/><br/>But since this is the first message, the user is expecting me to generate this. <br/><br/>So the final answer is the structured message with those three parts.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me structure my next response properly. The user wants the strategic reasoning to be the first part, followed by other tags like ARGUMENT or PROPOSAL. <br/><br/>In my first attempt, I had STRATEGIC REASONING but then included ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. But maybe the user wants the strategic reasoning to be the only first part, and then other tags can follow. Wait, the rules say that each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING. So even if there are other tags, the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING. <br/><br/>So I need to rephrase my response to start with STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me think of a concise reasoning. Maybe focus on selecting high importance items with low effort. For example, B85 has a high importance (400) and very low effort (17), so that&#x27;s a good start. Then other items with good ratios. <br/><br/>Then, after the strategic reasoning, I can include the ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. But the user&#x27;s error was that the first structured format wasn&#x27;t STRATEGIC REASONING. So I need to ensure that the first line is exactly that. <br/><br/>Let me draft the STRATEGIC REASONING again. Maybe something like: &quot;I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance within the limit. Starting with B85 (400/17) and C15 (781/46) to secure high value early, then adding other high-ratio items like B12 (915/192) and A27 (822/239). This approach balances high importance with manageable effort to stay under the limit.&quot; <br/><br/>Then, the ARGUMENT would explain the selection based on ratios. The PROPOSAL would list those items. <br/><br/>I need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first part, followed by other tags. Also, check that the PROPOSAL&#x27;s total effort is under 9475. Let me calculate the effort of the proposed items. <br/><br/>B85:17, C15:46, B12:192, A27:239, B60:101, C34:409, B67:678, A08:515, B00:568, A30:552, A66:843, B46:345, C70:930, A58:843, C81:404, B10:772, C24:748, A16:573, B09:501, C06:133. <br/><br/>Adding these up: 17+46=63, +192=255, +239=494, +101=595, +409=1004, +678=1682, +515=2197, +568=2765, +552=3317, +843=4160, +345=4505, +930=5435, +843=6278, +404=6682, +772=7454, +748=8202, +573=8775, +501=9276, +133=9409. <br/><br/>Total effort is 9409, which is under 9475. So the proposal is valid. <br/><br/>So the corrected response should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. That should meet the user&#x27;s requirements.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user is pointing out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. Let me check the history.<br/><br/>In the first attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting was off. The user&#x27;s error message says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me look at the exact structure required.<br/><br/>The user specified that each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} as the first line. In my first response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING: ... followed by ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. But perhaps the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING wasn&#x27;t the very first line, or maybe the formatting wasn&#x27;t correct.<br/><br/>Wait, in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was the first line. But maybe the user is strict about the exact structure. Let me check the exact instructions again.<br/><br/>The rules state: &quot;You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.&quot; So each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then other tags. In my first response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING first, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. That should be correct. But the user is saying it&#x27;s not. Maybe the problem is that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING wasn&#x27;t properly formatted as a Python set or something else? No, the STRATEGIC REASONING is a string, not a set. The user&#x27;s error message says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}, which is a string. So perhaps the issue is that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not the very first line. Wait, looking at the first response:<br/><br/>The first line was &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize...&quot; which is correct. But maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only thing in the first line, without any other text. Or maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set? No, the STRATEGIC REASONING is a string, as per the protocol. The user&#x27;s error message says &quot;the very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot;. So the first line must be exactly that. In my first response, I had that. But perhaps the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first and only structured format in the message. Wait, no, the user allows other tags after. The problem might be that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s example shows that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be a string, not a set. So the first line should be &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: { ... }&quot; where the content is a string. In my first response, I had that. But maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set? No, the description says it&#x27;s a hidden message, so it&#x27;s a string. The user&#x27;s error message is probably because the STRATEGIC REASONING wasn&#x27;t the first line. Wait, in the first response, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. That should be correct. But the user is saying it&#x27;s not. Maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only thing in the message? No, the rules say you can have other tags. The user&#x27;s error message is probably because the STRATEGIC REASONING wasn&#x27;t properly formatted. Let me check the exact structure again.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.&quot; So the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden, but the other tags are visible. The user&#x27;s error is that the first structured format wasn&#x27;t STRATEGIC REASONING. So in my first response, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING. But maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and nothing else. Or perhaps the user is using a parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message can have other tags. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set, but that&#x27;s not the case. The STRATEGIC REASONING is a string. The user&#x27;s error message is probably because the first line wasn&#x27;t exactly &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot;. Let me check the exact formatting. In my first response, the first line was &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize...&quot; which is correct. But maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set, but that&#x27;s not the case. The user&#x27;s protocol says that the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, so it&#x27;s a string. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message can have other tags. So in my first response, I had that. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the problem is that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not properly enclosed in the correct format. Let me check the exact syntax again. The user says: &quot;A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings. So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}&quot;.<br/><br/>Wait, the STRATEGIC REASONING is not a set. The STRATEGIC REASONING is a string. The other tags like PROPOSAL, REFUSE, etc., require a set. So the STRATEGIC REASONING should be a string, not a set. So the first line should be &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: { ... }&quot; where the content is a string. In my first response, I had that. So why is the user getting an error? Maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set, but that&#x27;s not correct. The user&#x27;s instruction says that the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, so it&#x27;s a string. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message must follow. In my first response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. That should be correct. But the user is saying it&#x27;s not. Maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only thing in the message. But the rules say you can have other tags. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message must not have any other structured formats. But that&#x27;s not the case. The rules allow other tags. <br/><br/>This is confusing. The user&#x27;s error message says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my first response, I did that. But perhaps the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only structured format in the message. But the rules allow other tags. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message must not have any other structured formats. But that&#x27;s not the case. The rules allow other tags. <br/><br/>I think the issue might be that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax again. The user says: &quot;A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings. So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}&quot;.<br/><br/>But the STRATEGIC REASONING is not a set. It&#x27;s a string. So the STRATEGIC REASONING should be &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: { ... }&quot; where the content is a string. In my first response, I had that. So why the error? Maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set, but that&#x27;s not correct. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a parser that expects the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a set, but that&#x27;s not the case. The user&#x27;s instruction says that the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, so it&#x27;s a string. <br/><br/>This is a bit of a puzzle. To resolve this, I need to make sure that the first line of my response is exactly &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: { ... }&quot; with the content as a string. Let me try to format it again, ensuring that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message follows. Maybe in the previous attempt, there was a line break or formatting issue. <br/><br/>So, the correct approach is to start the message with STRATEGIC REASONING: { ... }, then include other tags like ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. Let me structure it properly this time.<br/></p>
