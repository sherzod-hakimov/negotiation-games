        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 8170<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;B21&quot;: 594, &quot;B00&quot;: 551, &quot;A08&quot;: 634, &quot;A27&quot;: 204, &quot;B94&quot;: 557, &quot;B53&quot;: 440, &quot;A23&quot;: 734, &quot;C65&quot;: 893, &quot;A89&quot;: 246, &quot;B67&quot;: 592, &quot;B45&quot;: 143, &quot;C34&quot;: 568, &quot;C12&quot;: 472, &quot;A05&quot;: 401, &quot;B60&quot;: 729, &quot;C92&quot;: 201, &quot;B69&quot;: 85, &quot;A84&quot;: 641, &quot;C06&quot;: 958, &quot;B12&quot;: 80, &quot;A16&quot;: 157, &quot;B85&quot;: 806, &quot;C35&quot;: 684, &quot;B10&quot;: 59, &quot;C15&quot;: 31, &quot;B09&quot;: 765, &quot;B16&quot;: 416, &quot;C81&quot;: 392, &quot;A58&quot;: 428, &quot;C24&quot;: 699, &quot;A30&quot;: 141, &quot;A66&quot;: 606, &quot;B75&quot;: 612, &quot;B46&quot;: 133, &quot;C70&quot;: 689}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;B21&quot;: 138, &quot;B00&quot;: 583, &quot;A08&quot;: 868, &quot;A27&quot;: 822, &quot;B94&quot;: 783, &quot;B53&quot;: 65, &quot;A23&quot;: 262, &quot;C65&quot;: 121, &quot;A89&quot;: 508, &quot;B67&quot;: 780, &quot;B45&quot;: 461, &quot;C34&quot;: 484, &quot;C12&quot;: 668, &quot;A05&quot;: 389, &quot;B60&quot;: 808, &quot;C92&quot;: 215, &quot;B69&quot;: 97, &quot;A84&quot;: 500, &quot;C06&quot;: 30, &quot;B12&quot;: 915, &quot;A16&quot;: 856, &quot;B85&quot;: 400, &quot;C35&quot;: 444, &quot;B10&quot;: 623, &quot;C15&quot;: 781, &quot;B09&quot;: 786, &quot;B16&quot;: 3, &quot;C81&quot;: 713, &quot;A58&quot;: 457, &quot;C24&quot;: 273, &quot;A30&quot;: 739, &quot;A66&quot;: 822, &quot;B75&quot;: 235, &quot;B46&quot;: 606, &quot;C70&quot;: 105}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>You may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>You may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>Total effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.<br/>Do NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.<br/>A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 8170. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make assumptions or strategies based on my own data.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>B21:594, B00:551, A08:634, A27:204, B94:557, B53:440, A23:734, C65:893, A89:246, B67:592, B45:143, C34:568, C12:472, A05:401, B60:729, C92:201, B69:85, A84:641, C06:958, B12:80, A16:157, B85:806, C35:684, B10:59, C15:31, B09:765, B16:416, C81:392, A58:428, C24:699, A30:141, A66:606, B75:612, B46:133, C70:689.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step. Let me start adding:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add B21: 594 → 594<br/><br/>B00: 551 → 594+551=1145<br/><br/>A08:634 → 1145+634=1779<br/><br/>A27:204 → 1779+204=1983<br/><br/>B94:557 → 1983+557=2540<br/><br/>B53:440 → 2540+440=2980<br/><br/>A23:734 → 2980+734=3714<br/><br/>C65:893 → 3714+893=4607<br/><br/>A89:246 → 4607+246=4853<br/><br/>B67:592 → 4853+592=5445<br/><br/>B45:143 → 5445+143=5588<br/><br/>C34:568 → 5588+568=6156<br/><br/>C12:472 → 6156+472=6628<br/><br/>A05:401 → 6628+401=7029<br/><br/>B60:729 → 7029+729=7758<br/><br/>C92:201 → 7758+201=7959<br/><br/>B69:85 → 7959+85=8044<br/><br/>A84:641 → 8044+641=8685 → Oh, this is over 8170. So adding A84 would exceed the limit. So the total effort of all items is 8685, which is over the limit. So we can&#x27;t take everything. Therefore, we need to select a subset.<br/><br/>So the first step is to figure out which items to include. Since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should prioritize items with high importance relative to their effort. That is, items where importance/effort ratio is high. This is similar to the knapsack problem where you maximize value per weight.<br/><br/>So I need to calculate for each item the importance divided by effort. Then sort them in descending order and pick the top ones until the total effort is under 8170.<br/><br/>Let me compute that.<br/><br/>First, list all items with their importance and effort:<br/><br/>Item | Importance | Effort | Ratio (Importance/Effort)<br/>B21 | 138 | 594 | ~0.232<br/>B00 | 583 | 551 | ~1.058<br/>A08 | 868 | 634 | ~1.369<br/>A27 | 822 | 204 | ~4.030<br/>B94 | 783 | 557 | ~1.406<br/>B53 | 65 | 440 | ~0.148<br/>A23 | 262 | 734 | ~0.357<br/>C65 | 121 | 893 | ~0.136<br/>A89 | 508 | 246 | ~2.065<br/>B67 | 780 | 592 | ~1.318<br/>B45 | 461 | 143 | ~3.224<br/>C34 | 484 | 568 | ~0.852<br/>C12 | 668 | 472 | ~1.415<br/>A05 | 389 | 401 | ~0.970<br/>B60 | 808 | 729 | ~1.108<br/>C92 | 215 | 201 | ~1.069<br/>B69 | 97 | 85 | ~1.141<br/>A84 | 500 | 641 | ~0.780<br/>C06 | 30 | 958 | ~0.031<br/>B12 | 915 | 80 | ~11.438<br/>A16 | 856 | 157 | ~5.452<br/>B85 | 400 | 806 | ~0.496<br/>C35 | 444 | 684 | ~0.649<br/>B10 | 623 | 59 | ~10.559<br/>C15 | 781 | 31 | ~25.194<br/>B09 | 786 | 765 | ~1.027<br/>B16 | 3 | 416 | ~0.007<br/>C81 | 713 | 392 | ~1.819<br/>A58 | 457 | 428 | ~1.068<br/>C24 | 273 | 699 | ~0.391<br/>A30 | 739 | 141 | ~5.241<br/>A66 | 822 | 606 | ~1.356<br/>B75 | 235 | 612 | ~0.384<br/>B46 | 606 | 133 | ~4.556<br/>C70 | 105 | 689 | ~0.152<br/><br/>Now, sort these by ratio descending:<br/><br/>1. C15: 25.194<br/>2. B12: 11.438<br/>3. A16: 5.452<br/>4. A30: 5.241<br/>5. B46: 4.556<br/>6. A27: 4.030<br/>7. B69: 1.141<br/>8. C92: 1.069<br/>9. B60: 1.108<br/>10. C81: 1.819 (Wait, C81 is 1.819, which is higher than B60&#x27;s 1.108. So maybe I made a mistake in ordering. Let me recheck.<br/><br/>Wait, C81&#x27;s ratio is 713/392 ≈ 1.819. So that&#x27;s higher than B60&#x27;s 1.108. So the correct order after C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27 would be C81, then B69, C92, B60, etc.<br/><br/>So corrected list:<br/><br/>1. C15: 25.194<br/>2. B12: 11.438<br/>3. A16: 5.452<br/>4. A30: 5.241<br/>5. B46: 4.556<br/>6. A27: 4.030<br/>7. C81: 1.819<br/>8. B69: 1.141<br/>9. C92: 1.069<br/>10. B60: 1.108<br/>... and so on.<br/><br/>So the highest ratio items are C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, etc.<br/><br/>Now, let&#x27;s start adding these items, keeping track of total effort and total importance.<br/><br/>Start with C15: effort 31, importance 781. Total effort 31, total importance 781.<br/><br/>Next B12: effort 80. Total effort 31+80=111. Importance 781+915=1696.<br/><br/>A16: effort 157. Total 111+157=268. Importance 1696+856=2552.<br/><br/>A30: effort 141. Total 268+141=409. Importance 2552+739=3291.<br/><br/>B46: effort 133. Total 409+133=542. Importance 3291+606=3897.<br/><br/>A27: effort 204. Total 542+204=746. Importance 3897+822=4719.<br/><br/>C81: effort 392. Total 746+392=1138. Importance 4719+713=5432.<br/><br/>B69: effort 85. Total 1138+85=1223. Importance 5432+97=5529.<br/><br/>C92: effort 201. Total 1223+201=1424. Importance 5529+215=5744.<br/><br/>B60: effort 729. Total 1424+729=2153. Importance 5744+808=6552.<br/><br/>C81 is already added. Next, maybe B67: ratio 1.318. Effort 592. Adding that would take total effort to 2153+592=2745. Importance 6552+780=7332.<br/><br/>Then B94: 557 effort. 2745+557=3302. Importance 7332+783=8115.<br/><br/>A08: 634. 3302+634=3936. Importance 8115+868=8983.<br/><br/>A05: 401. 3936+401=4337. Importance 8983+389=9372.<br/><br/>B00: 551. 4337+551=4888. Importance 9372+583=9955.<br/><br/>A89: 246. 4888+246=5134. Importance 9955+508=10463.<br/><br/>B67: already added. Next, maybe B09: 765 effort. 5134+765=5899. Importance 10463+786=11249.<br/><br/>A58: 428. 5899+428=6327. Importance 11249+457=11706.<br/><br/>C34: 568. 6327+568=6895. Importance 11706+484=12190.<br/><br/>C12: 472. 6895+472=7367. Importance 12190+668=12858.<br/><br/>B10: 59. 7367+59=7426. Importance 12858+623=13481.<br/><br/>A05 is already added. Next, B53: 440. 7426+440=7866. Importance 13481+65=13546.<br/><br/>C35: 684. 7866+684=8550. Over the limit. So can&#x27;t add.<br/><br/>B85: 806. 7866+806=8672. Over.<br/><br/>C65: 893. 7866+893=8759. Over.<br/><br/>A84: 641. 7866+641=8507. Over.<br/><br/>C24: 699. 7866+699=8565. Over.<br/><br/>A66: 606. 7866+606=8472. Over.<br/><br/>B75: 612. 7866+612=8478. Over.<br/><br/>C70: 689. 7866+689=8555. Over.<br/><br/>So after adding up to B53, the total effort is 7866. Then adding B53 brings it to 7866. Then next possible items would be those with lower effort. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>After B53 (effort 440), total is 7866. The remaining effort is 8170-7866=304. So we can add items with effort &lt;=304.<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items not yet added:<br/><br/>C35: 684 (too big), C65:893, A84:641, C24:699, A66:606, B75:612, C70:689. All these are over 304. So no more items can be added. So the total effort is 7866, which is under 8170. So the total importance would be 13546.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, maybe replacing some items with higher ratio but lower effort. Let me check.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps after adding up to B53 (7866), we can add some other items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>The remaining effort is 304. So items with effort &lt;=304. Let&#x27;s check which items are left:<br/><br/>Looking at the list, items not yet added:<br/><br/>C35 (684), C65 (893), A84 (641), C24 (699), A66 (606), B75 (612), C70 (689). All of these have effort over 304. So no. So the maximum we can get is 7866 effort, 13546 importance.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a different combination. For example, maybe not taking B53 (which has a low ratio) and instead taking other items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps after A27 (746 effort), instead of adding C81 (392), maybe add other items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>At 746 effort, remaining is 8170-746=7424. So we can add more items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>After A27 (746), next items could be C81 (392), B69 (85), C92 (201), B60 (729), etc. But perhaps there&#x27;s a better way.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe after A27, add B69 (85) first. Then C92 (201), then B60 (729), etc. But the order might not matter as long as we pick the highest ratio items first.<br/><br/>But according to the ratio-based approach, the order is correct. So the initial selection seems optimal.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s check if there&#x27;s a way to include more high-ratio items. For example, C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, B69, C92, B60, B94, A08, A05, B00, A89, B67, B53. That&#x27;s 16 items. Let me check the total effort again.<br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s recalculate the total effort step by step:<br/><br/>C15:31<br/><br/>B12:80 → 111<br/><br/>A16:157 → 268<br/><br/>A30:141 → 409<br/><br/>B46:133 → 542<br/><br/>A27:204 → 746<br/><br/>C81:392 → 1138<br/><br/>B69:85 → 1223<br/><br/>C92:201 → 1424<br/><br/>B60:729 → 2153<br/><br/>B94:557 → 2710<br/><br/>A08:634 → 3344<br/><br/>A05:401 → 3745<br/><br/>B00:551 → 4296<br/><br/>A89:246 → 4542<br/><br/>B67:592 → 5134<br/><br/>B53:440 → 5574<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 5574. Then remaining effort is 8170-5574=2596. So there&#x27;s still a lot of effort left. So maybe I missed some items. Let me check again.<br/><br/>Wait, in the previous calculation, after B53, the total was 7866. But that seems inconsistent. Let me re-calculate the total effort step by step.<br/><br/>Let me list all the items in the order they were added:<br/><br/>1. C15:31 → total 31<br/>2. B12:80 → 111<br/>3. A16:157 → 268<br/>4. A30:141 → 409<br/>5. B46:133 → 542<br/>6. A27:204 → 746<br/>7. C81:392 → 1138<br/>8. B69:85 → 1223<br/>9. C92:201 → 1424<br/>10. B60:729 → 2153<br/>11. B94:557 → 2710<br/>12. A08:634 → 3344<br/>13. A05:401 → 3745<br/>14. B00:551 → 4296<br/>15. A89:246 → 4542<br/>16. B67:592 → 5134<br/>17. B53:440 → 5574<br/><br/>So total effort is 5574. That&#x27;s way under 8170. So why did I think it was 7866 earlier? Maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me check again.<br/><br/>Wait, in the previous step-by-step, after B53, the total was 7866. But according to this, it&#x27;s 5574. There&#x27;s a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong.<br/><br/>Ah, I think I confused the order. Let me re-calculate the total effort again, step by step, for all the items added in the ratio order.<br/><br/>Let me list all the items in the order of their ratio:<br/><br/>1. C15 (31)<br/>2. B12 (80)<br/>3. A16 (157)<br/>4. A30 (141)<br/>5. B46 (133)<br/>6. A27 (204)<br/>7. C81 (392)<br/>8. B69 (85)<br/>9. C92 (201)<br/>10. B60 (729)<br/>11. B94 (557)<br/>12. A08 (634)<br/>13. A05 (401)<br/>14. B00 (551)<br/>15. A89 (246)<br/>16. B67 (592)<br/>17. B53 (440)<br/><br/>Now, adding these in order:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add C15: 31 → 31<br/><br/>B12: 80 → 111<br/><br/>A16: 157 → 268<br/><br/>A30: 141 → 409<br/><br/>B46: 133 → 542<br/><br/>A27: 204 → 746<br/><br/>C81: 392 → 1138<br/><br/>B69: 85 → 1223<br/><br/>C92: 201 → 1424<br/><br/>B60: 729 → 2153<br/><br/>B94: 557 → 2710<br/><br/>A08: 634 → 3344<br/><br/>A05: 401 → 3745<br/><br/>B00: 551 → 4296<br/><br/>A89: 246 → 4542<br/><br/>B67: 592 → 5134<br/><br/>B53: 440 → 5574<br/><br/>So total effort is 5574. That&#x27;s under 8170. So there&#x27;s still 8170-5574=2596 effort left. So why did I think it was 7866 before? That must have been a miscalculation. So the total effort is 5574, which is well under the limit. So we can add more items.<br/><br/>So after B53, we have 2596 effort left. Let&#x27;s see which items are left and can be added.<br/><br/>The remaining items not yet added are:<br/><br/>C65 (893), A23 (734), C34 (568), C12 (472), A84 (641), C06 (958), B16 (416), C35 (684), B10 (59), C15 is already added, etc.<br/><br/>Wait, C15 is already added. So the remaining items are:<br/><br/>C65, A23, C34, C12, A84, C06, B16, C35, B10, C70, etc.<br/><br/>Now, we need to find items with effort &lt;=2596. Let&#x27;s check their ratios.<br/><br/>For example, C65: effort 893, importance 121. Ratio 0.136. Not good.<br/><br/>A23: 734 effort, 262 importance. Ratio 0.357.<br/><br/>C34: 568 effort, 484 importance. Ratio 0.852.<br/><br/>C12: 472 effort, 668 importance. Ratio 1.415.<br/><br/>A84: 641 effort, 500 importance. Ratio 0.780.<br/><br/>C06: 958 effort, 30 importance. Ratio 0.031.<br/><br/>B16: 416 effort, 3 importance. Ratio 0.007.<br/><br/>C35: 684 effort, 444 importance. Ratio 0.649.<br/><br/>B10: 59 effort, 623 importance. Ratio 10.559.<br/><br/>C70: 689 effort, 105 importance. Ratio 0.152.<br/><br/>So the next highest ratio is B10 (10.559). Effort 59. Adding that would take total effort to 5574+59=5633. Importance 13546+623=14169.<br/><br/>Then, next highest ratio is C12 (1.415). Effort 472. 5633+472=6105. Importance 14169+668=14837.<br/><br/>Then C34 (0.852). Effort 568. 6105+568=6673. Importance 14837+484=15321.<br/><br/>Then A84 (0.780). Effort 641. 6673+641=7314. Importance 15321+500=15821.<br/><br/>Then B16 (0.007). Not worth it. C06 (0.031). No. C65 (0.136). No. C70 (0.152). No. C35 (0.649). Effort 684. 7314+684=7998. Importance 15821+444=16265.<br/><br/>Then remaining effort is 8170-7998=172. So can we add any items with effort &lt;=172?<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items:<br/><br/>B10 is already added. C12 is added. C34 added. A84 added. C35 added. What&#x27;s left?<br/><br/>C65 (893), A23 (734), C06 (958), B16 (416), C70 (689). All of these have effort over 172. So no. So total effort is 7998, importance 16265.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe there are other items with lower effort. Let me check again.<br/><br/>After adding B53 (5574), we have 2596 left. So after adding B10 (59), C12 (472), C34 (568), A84 (641), C35 (684), total effort is 5574+59+472+568+641+684=5574+59=5633+472=6105+568=6673+641=7314+684=7998. So 7998. Then remaining 172.<br/><br/>Is there any item with effort &lt;=172? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the list:<br/><br/>B10 is already added. What about B16 (416)? No. C12 is added. C34 added. A84 added. C35 added. What about B46? Already added. A27 added. C81 added. B69 added. C92 added. B60 added. B94 added. A08 added. A05 added. B00 added. A89 added. B67 added. B53 added.<br/><br/>What about A30? Already added. A16 added. A05 added. B12 added. C15 added. So the remaining items are C65, A23, C06, B16, C70. All of these have effort over 172. So no. So the total is 7998, importance 16265.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, instead of adding C35 (684), maybe add other items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>After 7314 (after A84), remaining effort is 8170-7314=856. So we can add items with effort up to 856.<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items:<br/><br/>C65 (893) is over. A23 (734) is under 856. So adding A23 (734) would take total effort to 7314+734=8048. Importance 15821+262=16083. Then remaining effort is 8170-8048=122. Can we add any items with effort &lt;=122?<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items: B16 (416), C06 (958), C70 (689). No. So total importance would be 16083. Which is less than 16265. So adding C35 is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 7314, maybe add C70 (689). 7314+689=8003. Importance 15821+105=15926. Then remaining 167. Still no items. So 15926 is worse than 16265.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 7314, add C35 (684) to get 7998, then maybe add B10 (already added). So 16265 is better.<br/><br/>So the maximum importance I can get is 16265 with effort 7998. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. Let me check if there are other items that can be added.<br/><br/>Wait, what about B10 (59) is already added. What about other items with lower effort? For example, B10 is 59, which is already added. Are there any other items with effort &lt;=172?<br/><br/>Looking at the list:<br/><br/>B10 is 59. What about B16 (416)? No. C12 is 472. C34 is 568. A84 is 641. C35 is 684. C65 is 893. A23 is 734. C06 is 958. C70 is 689. So no. So no more items can be added.<br/><br/>So the total importance is 16265. But maybe there&#x27;s a different selection that gives higher importance. For example, maybe not taking some lower ratio items to make room for higher ratio ones.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the initial selection is not optimal. Let me think. For example, maybe instead of taking B53 (which has a low ratio), we can take other items. But B53 has a low ratio, so it&#x27;s better to take higher ratio items first.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the order of adding items is correct. So the initial selection seems optimal.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s check if there are other high ratio items that I might have missed. For example, C15 is the highest, then B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, B69, C92, B60, B94, A08, A05, B00, A89, B67, B53. That&#x27;s 17 items. Total effort 5574. Then adding B10 (59) brings it to 5633, then C12 (472) to 6105, C34 (568) to 6673, A84 (641) to 7314, C35 (684) to 7998. So that&#x27;s 17 items. Then adding B10, C12, C34, A84, C35. That&#x27;s 5 more items. Total 22 items. But the total effort is 7998. So there&#x27;s still 172 left. But no items can be added.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, maybe not taking B53 and instead taking other items. But B53 has a low ratio, so it&#x27;s better to take higher ratio items first.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial selection is correct. So the maximum importance I can get is 16265. But I need to make sure that this is indeed the case.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a different combination. For example, if I don&#x27;t take B53, but take other items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>If I skip B53 (440 effort), then after B67 (5134), the total is 5134. Then remaining effort is 8170-5134=3036. So I can add more items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>After B67 (5134), add C35 (684) → 5134+684=5818. Importance 13481+444=13925.<br/><br/>Then add B10 (59) → 5818+59=5877. Importance 13925+623=14548.<br/><br/>Then add C12 (472) → 5877+472=6349. Importance 14548+668=15216.<br/><br/>Then add C34 (568) → 6349+568=6917. Importance 15216+484=15700.<br/><br/>Then add A84 (641) → 6917+641=7558. Importance 15700+500=16200.<br/><br/>Then add B60 (729) → 7558+729=8287. Over the limit. So can&#x27;t. So total effort 7558. Importance 16200. Which is less than 16265. So the previous approach is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 7558, add B69 (85) → 7558+85=7643. Importance 16200+97=16297. Then remaining 8170-7643=527. Can we add more? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>B10 is already added. C12 added. C34 added. A84 added. C35 added. B69 added. What&#x27;s left? C65 (893), A23 (734), C06 (958), B16 (416), C70 (689). All over 527. So no. So total importance 16297. Which is slightly higher than 16265. But this requires not taking B53. So this is better. So this suggests that maybe the initial approach of taking B53 is not optimal.<br/><br/>So this shows that the order of adding items might not be the best. So perhaps the ratio-based approach is not perfect, and we need to consider other factors.<br/><br/>So in this case, by not taking B53 (which has a low ratio), we can take C35 (684) and B69 (85), which might give a higher total importance. So this suggests that the initial ratio-based approach might not be optimal, and we need to consider other combinations.<br/><br/>This indicates that the problem is more complex than just a simple knapsack, and we need to find the optimal subset. However, since I can&#x27;t compute all possibilities manually, I need to find a good heuristic.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to prioritize items with the highest importance per effort, but also consider that some items might have high importance but require a lot of effort, which could be better to include if they fit.<br/><br/>But given the time constraints, I need to make a proposal. Since the user is supposed to negotiate, perhaps the first step is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items, and then negotiate based on the other party&#x27;s response.<br/><br/>So the first proposal would be the set of items with the highest ratios, up to the limit. Let&#x27;s calculate the total effort and importance for that set.<br/><br/>From the previous calculation, the set includes C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, B69, C92, B60, B94, A08, A05, B00, A89, B67, B53. Total effort 5574. Then adding B10, C12, C34, A84, C35. Total effort 7998. Importance 16265.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if I can include more high-importance items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other participant&#x27;s importance values are different, so they might value different items. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to assume that my own importance is the only one I can maximize.<br/><br/>So the best I can do is to select items that maximize my own importance, within the effort limit. So the initial approach of selecting high ratio items seems correct.<br/><br/>Therefore, the first proposal should be the set of items that gives the highest possible importance for me, within the effort limit. Based on the calculations, that would be the set including C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, B69, C92, B60, B94, A08, A05, B00, A89, B67, B53, B10, C12, C34, A84, C35. Total effort 7998, importance 16265.<br/><br/>But I need to check if this is indeed the maximum. Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items. For example, after 7998, there&#x27;s 172 left. Are there any items with effort &lt;=172? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the list:<br/><br/>B10 is already added. What about B16 (416)? No. C12 is added. C34 added. A84 added. C35 added. What about B10 is already added. What about B10&#x27;s effort is 59. So maybe there are other items with lower effort. For example, B10 is 59, which is already added. Are there any other items with effort &lt;=172?<br/><br/>Looking at the list:<br/><br/>B10 is 59. What about B16 (416)? No. C12 is 472. C34 is 568. A84 is 641. C35 is 684. C65 is 893. A23 is 734. C06 is 958. C70 is 689. So no. So no items can be added. So the total is 7998.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a different combination. For example, if I don&#x27;t take C35 (684), but take other items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>After 7314 (after A84), remaining effort is 856. Instead of adding C35 (684), maybe add B10 (59) and C12 (472). 59+472=531. 7314+531=7845. Then remaining 8170-7845=325. Can we add more? For example, C34 (568) is over. A84 is already added. B60 is added. B94 is added. A08 added. A05 added. B00 added. A89 added. B67 added. B53 not added. So maybe add B53 (440) → 7845+440=8285. Over. So no. So total importance would be 15821 (from before adding C35) + 623 (B10) + 668 (C12) = 15821+623=16444+668=17112. Wait, no. Let me recalculate:<br/><br/>If after 7314 (A84), add B10 (59) → 7314+59=7373. Importance 15821+623=16444.<br/><br/>Then add C12 (472) → 7373+472=7845. Importance 16444+668=17112.<br/><br/>Then remaining effort 8170-7845=325. Can we add any items? For example, B53 (440) is over. C34 (568) over. A84 is already added. So no. So total importance 17112. Which is higher than 16265. So this is better. So this suggests that the initial approach of adding B53 might not be optimal. Instead, by not taking B53 and taking B10 and C12, we get a higher total importance.<br/><br/>So this shows that the ratio-based approach might not always give the best result, and we need to consider combinations.<br/><br/>So the key is to find the optimal subset. However, manually calculating all possibilities is time-consuming. But given the data, perhaps the best approach is to prioritize items with the highest importance per effort, but also consider that some items might allow for more items to be added.<br/><br/>In this case, by not taking B53 (which has a low ratio) and instead taking B10 and C12, we can get a higher total importance. So the optimal set might be:<br/><br/>C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, B69, C92, B60, B94, A08, A05, B00, A89, B67, B10, C12, C34, A84. Total effort 7845. Importance 17112.<br/><br/>But wait, let me check the exact numbers:<br/><br/>After adding up to A84 (7314), adding B10 (59) → 7373, then C12 (472) → 7845. Then remaining 325. Can we add any other items? For example, B16 (416) is over. C34 (568) over. A84 is already added. So no. So total importance is 17112.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 7845, can we add B53 (440)? 7845+440=8285. Over. So no. So this is better than the previous 16265. So this suggests that the initial approach of adding B53 was not optimal. So the correct approach is to skip B53 and take B10 and C12 instead.<br/><br/>So the optimal set would be the items up to A84 (7314), then B10 and C12. Total effort 7845, importance 17112.<br/><br/>But then, is there a way to add more items? For example, after 7845, remaining 325. Are there any items with effort &lt;=325? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the list:<br/><br/>B10 is added. C12 added. What about B16 (416)? No. C34 (568) no. A84 added. C35 (684) no. C65 (893) no. A23 (734) no. C06 (958) no. C70 (689) no. B53 (440) no. So no. So total is 17112.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another combination. For example, after 7314 (A84), add C34 (568) → 7314+568=7882. Importance 15821+484=16305. Then remaining 8170-7882=288. Can we add B10 (59) → 7882+59=7941. Importance 16305+623=16928. Then remaining 229. Can we add C12 (472)? No. So total importance 16928. Which is less than 17112. So the previous approach is better.<br/><br/>So the best so far is 17112. But maybe there&#x27;s another combination. For example, after 7314 (A84), add C35 (684) → 7314+684=7998. Importance 15821+444=16265. Then remaining 172. Can&#x27;t add anything. So 16265.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 7314, add B69 (85) → 7314+85=7399. Importance 15821+97=15918. Then remaining 8170-7399=771. Can we add more? For example, C12 (472) → 7399+472=7871. Importance 15918+668=16586. Then remaining 8170-7871=299. Can we add B10 (59) → 7871+59=7930. Importance 16586+623=17209. Then remaining 240. Can we add C34 (568)? No. So total importance 17209. Which is better than 17112. So this is better.<br/><br/>So this path gives 17209. Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>After A84 (7314), add B69 (85) → 7399. Then C12 (472) → 7871. Then B10 (59) → 7930. Total importance 15821 (up to A84) +97 (B69) +668 (C12) +623 (B10) = 15821+97=15918+668=16586+623=17209.<br/><br/>Yes. So this is better. So this suggests that the order of adding items matters. So the initial ratio-based approach might not be the best, and we need to consider combinations.<br/><br/>This shows that the problem requires a more nuanced approach. However, given the time, I need to make a proposal. The best I can do is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items, but also considers combinations that allow for more items.<br/><br/>So the first proposal could be the set that includes C15, B12, A16, A30, B46, A27, C81, B69, C92, B60, B94, A08, A05, B00, A89, B67, B10, C12, C34, A84. Total effort 7845, importance 17112. But I need to check if this is under the limit. 7845 is under 8170. So this is valid.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items. For example, after 7845, can we add B53 (440)? 7845+440=8285. Over. No. What about B16 (416)? 7845+416=8261. Over. C34 (568) → 7845+568=8413. Over. So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 7845, add B10 (59) and C12 (472) as before. So total 7845. So the proposal would be this set.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that this set is under the limit. 7845 is under 8170. So yes.<br/><br/>So the first proposal would be this set. Then, during negotiation, the other party might refuse or propose their own set. But since I don&#x27;t know their importance values, I have to rely on my own.<br/><br/>Therefore, the first step is to propose this set. The STRATEGIC REASONING would explain that I&#x27;m prioritizing items with the highest importance per effort, and then adjusting based on possible combinations to maximize my total importance.<br/><br/>So the first message would be a PROPOSAL with this set, along with an ARGUMENT explaining the strategy, and a STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit.

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING with the reasoning inside. Then follow with ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. Let me restructure my response. <br/><br/>The strategic reasoning should explain my approach step by step. I should mention prioritizing high importance-to-effort ratios, starting with the best ones, then adjusting as needed. Also, note that I can&#x27;t reveal my importance values, so I have to keep that hidden. <br/><br/>The ARGUMENT needs to defend the proposal, explaining that it&#x27;s based on maximizing my importance within the limit. The PROPOSAL is the set of items I&#x27;m suggesting. <br/><br/>I need to ensure that all structured tags are correctly formatted with the colon and whitespace. Also, the set elements should be in curly braces. Let me double-check the items in the proposal to make sure their total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 8170. <br/><br/>Calculating the total effort for the proposed items: Let&#x27;s add up each item&#x27;s effort. For example, C15 is 31, B12 is 80, A16 is 157, A30 is 141, B46 is 133, A27 is 204, C81 is 392, B69 is 85, C92 is 201, B60 is 729, B94 is 557, A08 is 634, A05 is 401, B00 is 551, A89 is 246, B67 is 592, B10 is 59, C12 is 472, C34 is 568, A84 is 641. <br/><br/>Adding these up: 31+80=111, +157=268, +141=409, +133=542, +204=746, +392=1138, +85=1223, +201=1424, +729=2153, +557=2710, +634=3344, +401=3745, +551=4296, +246=4542, +592=5134, +59=5193, +472=5665, +568=6233, +641=6874. That&#x27;s under 8170, so it&#x27;s valid. <br/><br/>Okay, the proposal is within the limit. Now, format everything correctly. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. Make sure there&#x27;s no extra text outside the structured formats. Also, include the ARGUMENT at least once, which I did. <br/><br/>I think that&#x27;s all. Let me put it all together properly.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let me figure out what&#x27;s going wrong here. The user is saying that my response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. Looking at my previous attempts, I see that in the first response, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING. But maybe the formatting wasn&#x27;t correct. The user specified that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} and that it should be the very first part of the message.<br/><br/>In my second attempt, I started with STRATEGIC REASONING again, but perhaps the issue is that the user expects the entire message to start with that tag, without any other text before it. Let me check the exact structure. The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}.&quot; So the first line of the response must be STRATEGIC REASONING: followed by the content, and nothing else before that.<br/><br/>In my previous responses, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING line first, but maybe there was some leading whitespace or other text. Wait, in the first response, I wrote:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize...  <br/>ARGUMENT: ...  <br/>PROPOSAL: ...<br/><br/>But maybe the user is expecting that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... and nothing else. Let me make sure that in the next attempt, the first line is strictly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... with no other content before it. Also, the user mentioned that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be included only once at the very beginning of every message. So each message must start with that tag, followed by other elements.<br/><br/>In my second attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but perhaps the user&#x27;s system is checking for strict adherence. Maybe the problem is that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was followed by a line break and then ARGUMENT, but the user wants the entire message to start with STRATEGIC REASONING as the first element. Let me structure the response so that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING: ... and then the rest of the elements follow. Also, ensuring that there&#x27;s no text before the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me try again, making sure that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... and then the other tags come after.<br/></p>
