I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7351. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make assumptions or strategies based on my own data.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nA08:518, B95:656, A39:96, A65:780, B81:190, B34:224, A28:231, C82:181, B69:312, A87:928, B64:826, B15:101, C79:61, B16:814, C53:322, C83:900, C10:744, A97:150, A25:65, C84:853, A71:454, B23:154, B96:237, C51:45, C17:766, B19:294, C72:985, A94:353, A46:60, B43:604, B37:92, A88:454, A96:206, C60:813, A75:234.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd 518 (A08) \u2192 518\n\n+656 (B95) \u2192 1174\n\n+96 (A39) \u2192 1270\n\n+780 (A65) \u2192 2050\n\n+190 (B81) \u2192 2240\n\n+224 (B34) \u2192 2464\n\n+231 (A28) \u2192 2695\n\n+181 (C82) \u2192 2876\n\n+312 (B69) \u2192 3188\n\n+928 (A87) \u2192 4116\n\n+826 (B64) \u2192 4942\n\n+101 (B15) \u2192 5043\n\n+61 (C79) \u2192 5104\n\n+814 (B16) \u2192 5918\n\n+322 (C53) \u2192 6240\n\n+900 (C83) \u2192 7140\n\n+744 (C10) \u2192 7884 \u2192 Oh, this is already over 7351. So even before adding the rest, we're over. So the total effort of all items is way over the limit. Therefore, we need to select a subset.\n\nSo the first step is to figure out which items to include. Since I want to maximize my own importance, I should prioritize items with high importance relative to their effort. That is, items where importance/effort ratio is high. This is similar to the knapsack problem where you maximize value per weight.\n\nLet me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. Let's list them:\n\nA08: 616 / 518 \u2248 1.189\nB95: 754 / 656 \u2248 1.149\nA39: 194 / 96 \u2248 2.021\nA65: 878 / 780 \u2248 1.126\nB81: 288 / 190 \u2248 1.516\nB34: 322 / 224 \u2248 1.437\nA28: 329 / 231 \u2248 1.424\nC82: 279 / 181 \u2248 1.541\nB69: 410 / 312 \u2248 1.314\nA87: 1026 / 928 \u2248 1.105\nB64: 924 / 826 \u2248 1.119\nB15: 199 / 101 \u2248 1.970\nC79: 159 / 61 \u2248 2.607\nB16: 912 / 814 \u2248 1.120\nC53: 420 / 322 \u2248 1.304\nC83: 998 / 900 \u2248 1.109\nC10: 842 / 744 \u2248 1.132\nA97: 248 / 150 \u2248 1.653\nA25: 163 / 65 \u2248 2.508\nC84: 951 / 853 \u2248 1.115\nA71: 552 / 454 \u2248 1.216\nB23: 252 / 154 \u2248 1.636\nB96: 335 / 237 \u2248 1.413\nC51: 143 / 45 \u2248 3.178\nC17: 864 / 766 \u2248 1.128\nB19: 392 / 294 \u2248 1.333\nC72: 1083 / 985 \u2248 1.100\nA94: 451 / 353 \u2248 1.278\nA46: 158 / 60 \u2248 2.633\nB43: 702 / 604 \u2248 1.162\nB37: 190 / 92 \u2248 2.065\nA88: 552 / 454 \u2248 1.216\nA96: 304 / 206 \u2248 1.476\nC60: 911 / 813 \u2248 1.120\n\nSo the highest ratios are C51 (3.178), A25 (2.508), C79 (2.607), A46 (2.633), A39 (2.021), B15 (1.970), B37 (2.065), etc. \n\nSo the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most bang for the effort. \n\nNow, let's try to build a set by adding items in order of their ratio, checking the cumulative effort.\n\nStart with C51 (45 effort, 143 importance). Total effort:45, importance:143.\n\nNext, A25 (65 effort, 163). Total effort:45+65=110. Importance:143+163=306.\n\nNext, C79 (61 effort, 159). Total effort:110+61=171. Importance:306+159=465.\n\nNext, A46 (60 effort, 158). Total effort:171+60=231. Importance:465+158=623.\n\nNext, A39 (96 effort, 194). Total effort:231+96=327. Importance:623+194=817.\n\nNext, B37 (92 effort, 190). Total effort:327+92=419. Importance:817+190=1007.\n\nNext, B15 (101 effort, 199). Total effort:419+101=520. Importance:1007+199=1206.\n\nNext, C72 (985 effort, 1083). Wait, 520+985=1505 which is way over 7351? No, wait, 520+985=1505? Wait, 520+985 is 1505? No, 500+900=1400, 20+85=105 \u2192 1505. But the limit is 7351. Wait, 1505 is way under. Wait, no, 520+985=1505? Wait, 520+985 is 1505? Let me check: 500+900=1400, 20+85=105 \u2192 1505. Yes. But 1505 is under 7351. So adding C72 would be possible. But wait, C72's importance is 1083, which is high. But maybe there are other items with higher ratios that I can add before that.\n\nWait, after B15, the next highest ratio is C51 (already added), then A25, C79, A46, A39, B37, B15. Then next would be B96 (1.413), C82 (1.541), B81 (1.516), etc. Wait, maybe I should check the next items after B15.\n\nWait, after B15, the next highest ratio is C51 (already added), then A25 (added), C79 (added), A46 (added), A39 (added), B37 (added), B15 (added). Then next would be B96 (1.413), C82 (1.541), B81 (1.516), C53 (1.304), etc.\n\nSo after B15, adding B96 (237 effort, 335 importance). Current total effort:520+237=757. Importance:1206+335=1541.\n\nThen C82 (181 effort, 279). 757+181=938. Importance:1541+279=1820.\n\nThen B81 (190 effort, 288). 938+190=1128. Importance:1820+288=2108.\n\nThen C53 (322 effort, 420). 1128+322=1450. Importance:2108+420=2528.\n\nThen B69 (312 effort, 410). 1450+312=1762. Importance:2528+410=2938.\n\nThen A87 (928 effort, 1026). 1762+928=2690. Importance:2938+1026=3964.\n\nThen B64 (826 effort, 924). 2690+826=3516. Importance:3964+924=4888.\n\nThen C83 (900 effort, 998). 3516+900=4416. Importance:4888+998=5886.\n\nThen C10 (744 effort, 842). 4416+744=5160. Importance:5886+842=6728.\n\nThen A97 (150 effort, 248). 5160+150=5310. Importance:6728+248=6976.\n\nThen A28 (231 effort, 329). 5310+231=5541. Importance:6976+329=7305.\n\nThen B23 (154 effort, 252). 5541+154=5695. Importance:7305+252=7557.\n\nThen A96 (206 effort, 304). 5695+206=5901. Importance:7557+304=7861.\n\nThen C60 (813 effort, 911). 5901+813=6714. Importance:7861+911=8772.\n\nThen A75 (234 effort, 332). 6714+234=6948. Importance:8772+332=9104.\n\nThen A88 (454 effort, 552). 6948+454=7402. Oh, that's over 7351. So can't add A88. So stop here.\n\nWait, but 6948 is under 7351. So adding A88 would make it 7402, which is over. So we can't add A88. So the next item would be B43 (604 effort, 702). 6948+604=7552, which is over. So can't add. B37 is already added. A94 (353 effort, 451). 6948+353=7301. That's under. So add A94. Importance:9104+451=9555. Effort:7301.\n\nThen A46 is already added. A71 (454 effort, 552). 7301+454=7755, over. B19 (294 effort, 392). 7301+294=7595, over. C72 is already added. C84 (853 effort, 951). 7301+853=8154, over. So the next possible is A94. So adding A94 gives total effort 7301, which is under 7351. Then maybe add A46 (already added), A25 (added), etc. Wait, but after A94, the remaining items would be A88 (454), which would make 7301+454=7755, over. So the maximum possible is 7301. So the total importance would be 9555.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe skipping some items with lower ratios but allowing more high-ratio items. But this is a greedy approach, which may not be optimal, but given the time constraints, it's a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more high-ratio items. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial items added were C51, A25, C79, A46, A39, B37, B15, B96, C82, B81, C53, B69, A87, B64, C83, C10, A97, A28, B23, A96, A94. That's a lot of items. Let me check the total effort again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate the cumulative effort:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nC51:45 \u2192 45\n\nA25:65 \u2192 45+65=110\n\nC79:61 \u2192 110+61=171\n\nA46:60 \u2192 171+60=231\n\nA39:96 \u2192 231+96=327\n\nB37:92 \u2192 327+92=419\n\nB15:101 \u2192 419+101=520\n\nB96:237 \u2192 520+237=757\n\nC82:181 \u2192 757+181=938\n\nB81:190 \u2192 938+190=1128\n\nC53:322 \u2192 1128+322=1450\n\nB69:312 \u2192 1450+312=1762\n\nA87:928 \u2192 1762+928=2690\n\nB64:826 \u2192 2690+826=3516\n\nC83:900 \u2192 3516+900=4416\n\nC10:744 \u2192 4416+744=5160\n\nA97:150 \u2192 5160+150=5310\n\nA28:231 \u2192 5310+231=5541\n\nB23:154 \u2192 5541+154=5695\n\nA96:206 \u2192 5695+206=5901\n\nA94:353 \u2192 5901+353=6254\n\nWait, earlier I thought after A94 it's 7301, but that's incorrect. Let me recheck:\n\nAfter A96 (5901), adding A94 (353) gives 5901+353=6254. Then, the next items would be A88 (454) \u2192 6254+454=6708. Then A75 (234) \u2192 6708+234=6942. Then C60 (813) \u2192 6942+813=7755 (over). So after A94, the total effort is 6254. Then adding A88 (454) would be 6708, which is under 7351. Then A75 (234) \u2192 6708+234=6942. Then C60 (813) would be 6942+813=7755 (over). So the maximum possible is 6942. But wait, 6254 + 454 (A88) = 6708. Then adding A75 (234) \u2192 6708+234=6942. Then maybe add B37 (already added), or other items. Let me check if there are other items with lower effort that can be added.\n\nFor example, after A94 (6254), maybe add A46 (already added), A25 (added), etc. What about B19 (294 effort, 392 importance). 6254+294=6548. Then maybe add B37 (already added). Or B23 (154) \u2192 6548+154=6702. Then A88 (454) \u2192 6702+454=7156. Then A75 (234) \u2192 7156+234=7390 (over). So that's over. So maybe after A88, we can't add A75. Alternatively, after A88 (6708), maybe add B37 (already added), or other items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. For example, instead of adding B96 (237 effort), maybe skip it and add other items. But this requires more detailed calculation. However, given the time, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable.\n\nBut the key point is that the total effort of the proposed set must be under 7351. So the initial proposal I thought of (up to A94) is 6254, which is under. Then adding A88 (454) would make 6708, which is under. Then adding A75 (234) would make 6942. Then maybe add B37 (already added), or other items. Let me check if there are other items with lower effort that can be added. For example, B37 is already in. What about C51 (already in), A25 (in), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more items. But this is getting complicated. The main thing is to propose a set that is under the limit and maximizes my importance. \n\nNow, the next step is to propose a set. Since I can't reveal my importance values, I need to propose a set that I think is good. Based on the above, the set would include items with high importance/effort ratios. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the total effort is under 7351. Let me calculate the total effort of the items I listed up to A94: 6254. Then adding A88 (454) \u2192 6708. Then A75 (234) \u2192 6942. Then maybe add B37 (already in), or other items. Let me check if there are other items with lower effort. For example, B37 is already in. What about C51 (45), A25 (65), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal set is different. But without knowing the other person's importance, it's hard to optimize for mutual benefit. However, since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on that.\n\nSo the initial proposal could be a set that includes the highest ratio items. Let me list the items in order of their ratio:\n\n1. C51 (3.178)\n2. A25 (2.508)\n3. C79 (2.607)\n4. A46 (2.633)\n5. A39 (2.021)\n6. B37 (2.065)\n7. B15 (1.970)\n8. B96 (1.413)\n9. C82 (1.541)\n10. B81 (1.516)\n11. C53 (1.304)\n12. B69 (1.314)\n13. A94 (1.278)\n14. A71 (1.216)\n15. A88 (1.216)\n16. B23 (1.636)\n17. A96 (1.476)\n18. C60 (1.120)\n19. C10 (1.132)\n20. B64 (1.119)\n21. C83 (1.109)\n22. C72 (1.100)\n23. A87 (1.105)\n24. B43 (1.162)\n25. A97 (1.653)\n26. B19 (1.333)\n27. A28 (1.424)\n28. C84 (1.115)\n\nWait, some of these ratios might be miscalculated. For example, A46 is 158/60=2.633, which is higher than C79's 2.607. So the order should be:\n\n1. C51 (3.178)\n2. A25 (2.508)\n3. A46 (2.633)\n4. C79 (2.607)\n5. A39 (2.021)\n6. B37 (2.065)\n7. B15 (1.970)\n8. B96 (1.413)\n9. C82 (1.541)\n10. B81 (1.516)\n11. C53 (1.304)\n12. B69 (1.314)\n13. A94 (1.278)\n14. A71 (1.216)\n15. A88 (1.216)\n16. B23 (1.636)\n17. A96 (1.476)\n18. C60 (1.120)\n19. C10 (1.132)\n20. B64 (1.119)\n21. C83 (1.109)\n22. C72 (1.100)\n23. A87 (1.105)\n24. B43 (1.162)\n25. B19 (1.333)\n26. A28 (1.424)\n27. C84 (1.115)\n\nSo the order is adjusted. Now, adding items in this order until the effort is under 7351.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStart with C51 (45) \u2192 45\n\nA25 (65) \u2192 110\n\nA46 (60) \u2192 170\n\nC79 (61) \u2192 231\n\nA39 (96) \u2192 327\n\nB37 (92) \u2192 419\n\nB15 (101) \u2192 520\n\nB96 (237) \u2192 757\n\nC82 (181) \u2192 938\n\nB81 (190) \u2192 1128\n\nC53 (322) \u2192 1450\n\nB69 (312) \u2192 1762\n\nA94 (353) \u2192 2115\n\nA71 (454) \u2192 2569\n\nA88 (454) \u2192 3023\n\nB23 (154) \u2192 3177\n\nA96 (206) \u2192 3383\n\nC60 (813) \u2192 4196\n\nC10 (744) \u2192 4940\n\nB64 (826) \u2192 5766\n\nC83 (900) \u2192 6666\n\nC72 (985) \u2192 7651 (over 7351). So can't add C72. So up to C83, total effort is 6666. Then maybe add B19 (294) \u2192 6666+294=6960. Then A28 (231) \u2192 6960+231=7191. Then A46 is already in. A75 (234) \u2192 7191+234=7425 (over). So can't add. So the total effort is 7191. Importance would be sum of all these items.\n\nBut this is a different set. The importance would be:\n\nC51:143, A25:163, A46:158, C79:159, A39:194, B37:190, B15:199, B96:335, C82:279, B81:288, C53:420, B69:410, A94:451, A71:552, A88:552, B23:252, A96:304, C60:911, C10:842, B64:924, C83:998, B19:392, A28:329.\n\nAdding all these:\n\n143+163=306; +158=464; +159=623; +194=817; +190=1007; +199=1206; +335=1541; +279=1820; +288=2108; +420=2528; +410=2938; +451=3389; +552=3941; +552=4493; +252=4745; +304=5049; +911=5960; +842=6802; +924=7726; +998=8724; +392=9116; +329=9445.\n\nSo total importance is 9445. Effort is 7191, which is under 7351. Then maybe add more items. For example, A75 (234) would make 7191+234=7425 (over). B37 is already in. What about B43 (604)? 7191+604=7795 (over). C84 (853) \u2192 7191+853=8044 (over). So no. So the maximum is 7191. But maybe there's a way to add more items by adjusting the order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replacing some items. For example, if I skip B96 (237 effort) and add other items. But this requires more analysis. However, given the time, I'll proceed with the initial proposal.\n\nSo the proposed set would be the items up to A28, which is 7191 effort. But I need to check if that's under 7351. Yes, 7191 is under. So the proposal could be that set. However, the exact items need to be listed.\n\nBut the problem is that I need to propose a set. Since I can't reveal my importance, I have to propose a set that I think is good. The initial proposal could be a set of high ratio items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other person has different importance values, so their proposal might be different. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal based on my own data.\n\nSo the first step is to make a proposal. Let me choose a set that includes the highest ratio items. For example, the set I calculated up to A28 (7191 effort). But I need to list all the items in that set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more optimal set. Let me try to find the maximum possible importance under 7351. This is a knapsack problem. But solving it optimally is time-consuming. However, given the time, I'll proceed with the greedy approach.\n\nSo the initial proposal would be a set of items with high importance/effort ratios. Let me list them:\n\nC51, A25, A46, C79, A39, B37, B15, B96, C82, B81, C53, B69, A94, A71, A88, B23, A96, C60, C10, B64, C83, B19, A28.\n\nTotal effort: 45+65+60+61+96+92+101+237+181+190+322+312+353+454+454+154+206+813+744+826+900+294+231 = let's calculate step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n+45 (C51) \u2192 45\n\n+65 (A25) \u2192 110\n\n+60 (A46) \u2192 170\n\n+61 (C79) \u2192 231\n\n+96 (A39) \u2192 327\n\n+92 (B37) \u2192 419\n\n+101 (B15) \u2192 520\n\n+237 (B96) \u2192 757\n\n+181 (C82) \u2192 938\n\n+190 (B81) \u2192 1128\n\n+322 (C53) \u2192 1450\n\n+312 (B69) \u2192 1762\n\n+353 (A94) \u2192 2115\n\n+454 (A71) \u2192 2569\n\n+454 (A88) \u2192 3023\n\n+154 (B23) \u2192 3177\n\n+206 (A96) \u2192 3383\n\n+813 (C60) \u2192 4196\n\n+744 (C10) \u2192 4940\n\n+826 (B64) \u2192 5766\n\n+900 (C83) \u2192 6666\n\n+294 (B19) \u2192 6960\n\n+231 (A28) \u2192 7191\n\nYes, that's 7191. So the total effort is under 7351. The importance is 9445 as calculated earlier. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to add more items. For example, after 7191, can I add any other items? Let's check the remaining items:\n\nItems not in the set: A08, B95, A65, B64 (already in?), wait no, B64 is in. Wait, the items in the set are:\n\nC51, A25, A46, C79, A39, B37, B15, B96, C82, B81, C53, B69, A94, A71, A88, B23, A96, C60, C10, B64, C83, B19, A28.\n\nSo remaining items are: A08, B95, A65, B43, C72, A87, C84, etc. Let's check their effort:\n\nA08:518 \u2192 7191+518=7709 (over)\n\nB95:656 \u2192 7191+656=7847 (over)\n\nA65:780 \u2192 7191+780=7971 (over)\n\nB43:604 \u2192 7191+604=7795 (over)\n\nC72:985 \u2192 7191+985=8176 (over)\n\nC84:853 \u2192 7191+853=8044 (over)\n\nSo no, can't add any more. So the total is 7191. \n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I remove some items with lower ratios and add others. For instance, if I remove B96 (237 effort, 335 importance) and add A08 (518 effort, 616 importance). But 7191 -237 +518 = 7191 + 281 = 7472 (over). Not good. Alternatively, remove B96 and add A08 and something else. But this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial proposal is acceptable. So the first proposal would be the set I listed. However, the exact items need to be in a set. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to propose a set. So I need to create a PROPOSAL with a set of items. Let me choose the set I calculated, which is 23 items. But that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe a smaller set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal set is different. For example, if I take C51, A25, A46, C79, A39, B37, B15, B96, C82, B81, C53, B69, A94, A71, A88, B23, A96, C60, C10, B64, C83, B19, A28. That's 23 items. But maybe there's a way to include more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other person's proposal is different. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal. \n\nSo the first message would be a PROPOSAL with this set. But the user's example shows that the proposal is a set of items. So I need to format it as {'A08', 'B95', ...} but in this case, the set would be the items I listed. \n\nBut the problem is that the user's message is the first one, so I need to start with a STRATEGIC REASONING, then a PROPOSAL. \n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit. I'll propose a set of high-ratio items.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'C51', 'A25', 'A46', 'C79', 'A39', 'B37', 'B15', 'B96', 'C82', 'B81', 'C53', 'B69', 'A94', 'A71', 'A88', 'B23', 'A96', 'C60', 'C10', 'B64', 'C83', 'B19', 'A28'}\n\nARGUMENT: I selected items based on their high importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total effort is under 7351. Let me check again. The total effort is 7191, which is under. So this is valid. \n\nHowever, the other participant might refuse this proposal. Then I need to adjust. But for the first message, this is the initial proposal.\n",

Let me check the history.\n\nIn my first attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting was off. The user's error message says the very first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me look at the exact structure required.\n\nThe user specified that each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} as the first line. In my previous response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING line first, but perhaps there was an issue with the formatting or maybe the system didn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first thing without any other text before it.\n\nWait, in my first response, I had:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...  \nPROPOSAL: ...  \nARGUMENT: ...\n\nBut the user's error says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line wasn't properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax. The user said each structured format must be followed by a colon and whitespace, and the argument must be a Python set. But in the STRATEGIC REASONING, the content is a string, not a set. Wait, no, the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, so the content is a string, not a set. The user's instruction says that for STRATEGIC REASONING, the content is a string, not a set. So the format should be STRATEGIC REASONING: '...' where ... is a string.\n\nIn my previous response, I used STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize... which is correct. But maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first line, with no other text before it. Let me check the exact message structure.\n\nThe user's instruction says: \"The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\" But the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden. However, the user's error message says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So perhaps in my previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not the first line. Wait, looking at the history, the user's first message was the initial setup, and my first response started with STRATEGIC REASONING. But maybe the system is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first thing in the message, with no other text before it. Let me check the exact message I sent.\n\nIn my first response, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING: ... followed by PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT. That should be correct. But the user is saying it's not. Maybe there's a formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only structured format in the message, but that's not the case. The user allows multiple structured formats in a message, as long as they are in the correct order.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.\" So each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then other tags. So in my previous response, I did that. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line was not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax again.\n\nThe user's example for STRATEGIC REASONING is: STRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'} but no, the content is a string. Wait, no, the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, so the content is a string. The user's instruction says: \"STRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\" but that's not correct. Wait, looking back at the user's message:\n\n\"STRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\"\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\"\n\nWait, the user's example shows that the STRATEGIC REASONING is followed by a colon and then a string, not a set. So the correct format is STRATEGIC REASONING: '...' where ... is a string. In my previous response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize... which is correct. But maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and perhaps there was a line break or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first line, with no other text before it. Let me make sure that in my response, the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... with no other text before it.\n\nIn my previous response, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize... which should be correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line was not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax again. The user says: \"A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\" But for STRATEGIC REASONING, the argument is a string, not a set. So the correct format is STRATEGIC REASONING: '...' where ... is a string. So in my response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize... which is correct. But perhaps the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and maybe there was a missing colon or something. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and any other text after that is not allowed. But according to the user's instructions, after STRATEGIC REASONING, other tags can follow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only structured format in the message, but that's not the case. The user allows multiple structured formats in a message, as long as they are in the correct order. So the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING, then other tags like PROPOSAL, ARGUMENT, etc.\n\nGiven that the user is still getting an error, perhaps I need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the very first line, with no other text before it. Let me try to structure the response again, ensuring that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... with no leading spaces or other content. Also, check that the colon is followed by a space. In my previous response, I had \"STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...\" which should be correct. But maybe the system is case-sensitive or requires exact formatting. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a different version of the protocol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message to follow. Let me try to reformat the response to strictly adhere to that. Let me make sure that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING: ... and then the other tags. Also, check that the ARGUMENT is included at least once. In my previous response, I did include ARGUMENT. So perhaps the error is due to a formatting issue in the STRATEGIC REASONING line. Let me try to write it again, ensuring that it's the first line and properly formatted.\n",
