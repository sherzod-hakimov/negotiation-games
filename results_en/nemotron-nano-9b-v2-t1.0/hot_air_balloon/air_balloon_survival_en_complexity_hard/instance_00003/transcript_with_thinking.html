    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 6938. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>A08:997, B95:950, A39:272, A65:448, B81:382, B34:804, A28:237, C82:56, B69:105, A87:612, B64:528, B15:527, C79:524, B16:167, C53:133, C83:300, C10:945, A97:50, A25:906, C84:70, A71:224, B23:4, B96:689, C51:64, C17:434, B19:750, C72:733, A94:873, A46:22, B43:68, B37:57, A88:10, A96:36, C60:551, A75:447.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step. Let me start adding:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add 997 (A08) → 997<br/><br/>+950 (B95) → 1947<br/><br/>+272 (A39) → 2219<br/><br/>+448 (A65) → 2667<br/><br/>+382 (B81) → 3049<br/><br/>+804 (B34) → 3853<br/><br/>+237 (A28) → 4090<br/><br/>+56 (C82) → 4146<br/><br/>+105 (B69) → 4251<br/><br/>+612 (A87) → 4863<br/><br/>+528 (B64) → 5391<br/><br/>+527 (B15) → 5918<br/><br/>+524 (C79) → 6442<br/><br/>+167 (B16) → 6609<br/><br/>+133 (C53) → 6742<br/><br/>+300 (C83) → 7042. Oh wait, that&#x27;s already over 6938. So the total effort of all items is 7042, which exceeds the limit. So we can&#x27;t take everything. Need to select a subset.<br/><br/>So the challenge is to pick items that sum to ≤6938, maximizing my importance. Since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, I need to focus on my own. But in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. However, since I can&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should aim for a set that&#x27;s as valuable to me as possible, but also perhaps items that are less important to them (but I don&#x27;t know that). Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that&#x27;s a good balance, but since I can&#x27;t see their values, perhaps I should just maximize my own.<br/><br/>But in a negotiation, the other person might refuse my proposal if they think they can get a better deal. So maybe I need to propose a set that&#x27;s good for me, but also not too bad for them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the problem states that my goal is to maximize my own importance, so perhaps I should focus on that.<br/><br/>So first, I need to find a subset of items with total effort ≤6938 that maximizes my importance. This is similar to the knapsack problem. Let me try to compute that.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t compute it here manually, maybe I can think of a strategy. The items with high importance and low effort would be good. Let&#x27;s look at my importance values:<br/><br/>Looking at the importance values:<br/><br/>A08:1096 (high), B95:1049 (high), A39:371, A65:547, B81:481, B34:903 (high), A28:336, C82:155, B69:204, A87:711, B64:627, B15:626, C79:623, B16:266, C53:232, C83:399, C10:1044 (very high), A97:149, A25:1005 (very high), C84:169, A71:323, B23:103, B96:788, C51:163, C17:533, B19:849 (high), C72:832 (high), A94:972 (high), A46:121, B43:167, B37:156, A88:109, A96:135, C60:650.<br/><br/>So the highest importance items for me are A08 (1096), B95 (1049), C10 (1044), A25 (1005), B19 (849), C72 (832), A94 (972), B96 (788), etc.<br/><br/>But their effort values vary. For example, A08 has effort 997, which is quite high. B95 is 950. C10 is 945. A25 is 906. B19 is 750. C72 is 733. A94 is 873. B96 is 689.<br/><br/>So if I take the top items by importance, but their effort might add up. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Suppose I take A08 (997), B95 (950), C10 (945), A25 (906). Let&#x27;s add their efforts:<br/><br/>997 + 950 = 1947<br/><br/>+945 = 2892<br/><br/>+906 = 3798. That&#x27;s under 6938. But maybe I can add more. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Next high importance items: B19 (750 effort), C72 (733), A94 (873), B96 (689), etc.<br/><br/>Adding B19 (750) to 3798: 3798+750=4548. Still under.<br/><br/>C72 (733): 4548+733=5281.<br/><br/>A94 (873): 5281+873=6154.<br/><br/>B96 (689): 6154+689=6843. Still under 6938. Then maybe add another item. Let&#x27;s see, what&#x27;s left? Maybe C60 (551 effort). 6843+551=7394 which is over. So maybe not. What about C83 (300)? 6843+300=7143, over. C53 (133): 6843+133=6976, which is over. C84 (70): 6843+70=6913. That&#x27;s under. So adding C84 (169 importance) would be good. So total effort 6913, which is under 6938. Then maybe add another small effort item. Like A88 (10), A96 (36), B23 (4), etc. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>6913 + 10 (A88) = 6923. Then add A96 (36) → 6923+36=6959, which is over. So maybe just A88. So total effort 6923. Then the importance would be 1096 (A08) + 1049 (B95) + 1044 (C10) + 1005 (A25) + 849 (B19) + 832 (C72) + 972 (A94) + 169 (C84) + 10 (A88) = let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>1096 + 1049 = 2145<br/><br/>+1044 = 3189<br/><br/>+1005 = 4194<br/><br/>+849 = 5043<br/><br/>+832 = 5875<br/><br/>+972 = 6847<br/><br/>+169 = 7016<br/><br/>+10 = 7026. That&#x27;s a total importance of 7026. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. However, this is just one possible set. But since I can&#x27;t compute all possibilities, I need to find a good subset.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe some items with high importance but lower effort. For example, B23 has effort 4 and importance 103. That&#x27;s a good value. Similarly, A88 (10 effort, 109 importance), A96 (36, 135), C51 (64, 163), etc. These could be added to the set without taking too much effort.<br/><br/>But the problem is that in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. For example, if they value C10 highly, but I don&#x27;t know. However, since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on that.<br/><br/>But in the negotiation, I need to propose a set. The first step is to make a proposal. Let me think of a set that includes the highest importance items for me, but with effort under the limit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should start with a proposal that includes the top items. Let&#x27;s try to create a proposal.<br/><br/>Let me list the items in order of my importance:<br/><br/>1. A08 (1096)<br/>2. B95 (1049)<br/>3. C10 (1044)<br/>4. A25 (1005)<br/>5. B19 (849)<br/>6. C72 (832)<br/>7. A94 (972)<br/>8. B96 (788)<br/>9. C60 (650)<br/>10. C83 (399)<br/>11. B64 (627)<br/>12. B15 (626)<br/>13. C79 (623)<br/>14. A65 (547)<br/>15. B81 (481)<br/>16. A87 (711)<br/>17. C53 (232)<br/>18. C17 (533)<br/>19. B69 (204)<br/>20. A39 (371)<br/>21. A71 (323)<br/>22. C84 (169)<br/>23. B43 (167)<br/>24. A46 (121)<br/>25. B37 (156)<br/>26. A97 (149)<br/>27. A28 (336)<br/>28. C82 (155)<br/>29. B34 (903) [Wait, B34 is 903 importance, which is higher than some others. Let me check again.]<br/><br/>Wait, B34 has importance 903, which is higher than C60 (650), C72 (832), etc. So maybe I should reorder.<br/><br/>So the correct order would be:<br/><br/>1. A08 (1096)<br/>2. B95 (1049)<br/>3. C10 (1044)<br/>4. A25 (1005)<br/>5. B34 (903)<br/>6. B19 (849)<br/>7. C72 (832)<br/>8. A94 (972)<br/>9. B96 (788)<br/>10. C60 (650)<br/>11. B64 (627)<br/>12. B15 (626)<br/>13. C79 (623)<br/>14. A65 (547)<br/>15. C17 (533)<br/>16. B81 (481)<br/>17. A87 (711)<br/>18. C53 (232)<br/>19. C83 (399)<br/>20. B43 (167)<br/>21. A46 (121)<br/>22. B37 (156)<br/>23. A97 (149)<br/>24. A28 (336)<br/>25. C84 (169)<br/>26. A88 (109)<br/>27. A96 (135)<br/>28. B23 (103)<br/><br/>So B34 is 903, which is higher than C72 (832). So in the list above, B34 is 5th. So including B34 would be important.<br/><br/>So let&#x27;s try to include B34. Let&#x27;s see the effort for B34 is 804. So adding that to the previous set.<br/><br/>Let me recalculate the effort for the set I had before. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>A08 (997), B95 (950), C10 (945), A25 (906), B34 (804), B19 (750), C72 (733), A94 (873), B96 (689), C84 (70), A88 (10). Let&#x27;s add these efforts:<br/><br/>997 + 950 = 1947<br/><br/>+945 = 2892<br/><br/>+906 = 3798<br/><br/>+804 = 4602<br/><br/>+750 = 5352<br/><br/>+733 = 6085<br/><br/>+873 = 6958. Oh, that&#x27;s over 6938. So that&#x27;s a problem. So adding B34 (804) would push the total over. So need to adjust.<br/><br/>So maybe remove some items. Let&#x27;s see. If I take A08, B95, C10, A25, B34. Let&#x27;s calculate their effort:<br/><br/>997 + 950 = 1947<br/><br/>+945 = 2892<br/><br/>+906 = 3798<br/><br/>+804 = 4602. That&#x27;s under 6938. Then maybe add more items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Next, B19 (750): 4602 + 750 = 5352. Then C72 (733): 5352 + 733 = 6085. Then A94 (873): 6085 + 873 = 6958. That&#x27;s over. So can&#x27;t add A94. So maybe instead of A94, add something else. Let&#x27;s see. What&#x27;s the next item? B96 (689). 6085 + 689 = 6774. Then add C84 (70): 6774 +70=6844. Then A88 (10): 6844+10=6854. Then maybe add B23 (4): 6854+4=6858. Then A96 (36): 6858+36=6894. Then C51 (64): 6894+64=6958. Over. So maybe stop at 6894. So the set would be A08, B95, C10, A25, B34, B19, C72, B96, C84, A88, B23, A96. Let&#x27;s check the total effort:<br/><br/>997 + 950 = 1947<br/><br/>+945 = 2892<br/><br/>+906 = 3798<br/><br/>+804 = 4602<br/><br/>+750 = 5352<br/><br/>+733 = 6085<br/><br/>+689 = 6774<br/><br/>+70 = 6844<br/><br/>+10 = 6854<br/><br/>+4 = 6858<br/><br/>+36 = 6894. Total effort 6894, which is under 6938. The importance would be:<br/><br/>1096 (A08) + 1049 (B95) + 1044 (C10) + 1005 (A25) + 903 (B34) + 849 (B19) + 832 (C72) + 788 (B96) + 169 (C84) + 10 (A88) + 103 (B23) + 135 (A96) = let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>1096 + 1049 = 2145<br/><br/>+1044 = 3189<br/><br/>+1005 = 4194<br/><br/>+903 = 5097<br/><br/>+849 = 5946<br/><br/>+832 = 6778<br/><br/>+788 = 7566<br/><br/>+169 = 7735<br/><br/>+10 = 7745<br/><br/>+103 = 7848<br/><br/>+135 = 7983. That&#x27;s a total importance of 7983. That&#x27;s pretty good. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to add more items. Let&#x27;s see. The remaining effort is 6938 - 6894 = 44. So can I add any items with effort ≤44? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the items not in the set:<br/><br/>C53 (133), C17 (434), C83 (300), B43 (68), A46 (22), B37 (57), C82 (56), A71 (224), etc. Wait, A46 is 22, which is under 44. So adding A46 (22) would bring total effort to 6894 +22=6916. Then maybe add B37 (57) would be 6916+57=6973, which is over. So A46 is possible. So adding A46 (121 importance) would add to the total. So total importance becomes 7983 +121=8104. That&#x27;s better. So the set would now include A46. Then the effort is 6916. Remaining effort is 6938-6916=22. Can I add another item? Like A96 (36) is over. B23 (4) is already in. A88 (10) is in. C84 (70) is in. So maybe A46 is the only one. So that&#x27;s a better set.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. But this is getting complicated. The key is to find a set that maximizes my importance under the effort limit. However, since I can&#x27;t compute all possibilities, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible.<br/><br/>But in the negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. For example, if they value C10 highly, but I don&#x27;t know. However, since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on that.<br/><br/>So my first proposal could be the set I just calculated: A08, B95, C10, A25, B34, B19, C72, B96, C84, A88, B23, A96, A46. Let me check the effort again:<br/><br/>A08:997<br/><br/>B95:950 → 1947<br/><br/>C10:945 → 2892<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3798<br/><br/>B34:804 → 4602<br/><br/>B19:750 → 5352<br/><br/>C72:733 → 6085<br/><br/>B96:689 → 6774<br/><br/>C84:70 → 6844<br/><br/>A88:10 → 6854<br/><br/>B23:4 → 6858<br/><br/>A96:36 → 6894<br/><br/>A46:22 → 6916. Total effort 6916, which is under 6938. So that&#x27;s acceptable. The importance is 7983 + 121 = 8104. That&#x27;s a good set.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more high-importance items. For example, if I remove some lower importance items to add higher ones. Let&#x27;s see. For example, if I remove A46 (121) and add something else. But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can include C60 (650 importance, effort 551). Let&#x27;s see. If I add C60 to the set, the effort would be 6916 +551=7467, which is over. So no. What about C79 (623 importance, 524 effort)? 6916 +524=7440, over. C83 (399, 300): 6916+300=7216, over. C17 (533, 434): 6916+434=7350, over. B43 (167, 68): 6916+68=6984, over. A71 (323, 224): 6916+224=7140, over. So no. So the current set is the best I can get with that combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can replace some items. For example, instead of A46 (121), maybe add another item. But I don&#x27;t see a better option. So this set seems good.<br/><br/>But in the negotiation, I need to propose this set. However, the other person might refuse it. But since I can&#x27;t know their preferences, I have to proceed.<br/><br/>So the first step is to make a proposal. Let me structure that.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B95&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A25&#x27;, &#x27;B34&#x27;, &#x27;B19&#x27;, &#x27;C72&#x27;, &#x27;B96&#x27;, &#x27;C84&#x27;, &#x27;A88&#x27;, &#x27;B23&#x27;, &#x27;A96&#x27;, &#x27;A46&#x27;}<br/><br/>But I need to check if the total effort is under 6938. As calculated, it&#x27;s 6916, which is under. So that&#x27;s valid.<br/><br/>Then, the other person might refuse. But since I can&#x27;t know their preferences, I have to proceed. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a different set. For example, maybe a set that includes more items with high importance but lower effort. But I think the set I have is already quite good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can include C60 (650 importance) by removing some lower importance items. Let&#x27;s see. For example, if I remove A46 (121) and add C60 (650). The effort would be 6916 -22 (A46) +551 (C60) = 6916 -22=6894 +551=7445, which is over. So that&#x27;s not possible. So that&#x27;s not feasible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove some lower importance items. For example, remove A96 (135) and add C60 (650). The effort would be 6916 -36 (A96) +551 (C60) = 6916 -36=6880 +551=7431, which is over. Still over. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove B23 (4) and add C60. 6916 -4 +551= 6916+547=7463, over. No.<br/><br/>So it seems that the set I have is the best possible in terms of my importance. So I should propose that.<br/><br/>But in the negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. For example, if they value C10 highly, but I don&#x27;t know. However, since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should proceed with this proposal.<br/><br/>Now, the next step is to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING. The ARGUMENT should defend my proposal. The STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden, but I need to include it in my message.<br/><br/>So the message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance to me, considering their effort. I selected high-importance items like A08, B95, C10, A25, B34, B19, C72, B96, C84, A88, B23, A96, and A46, which together stay under the effort limit. This combination maximizes my total importance while staying within the constraint.<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: I propose this set because it includes the highest importance items for me, ensuring maximum personal benefit. The total effort is 6916, which is under the limit, making it a feasible and optimal choice.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B95&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A25&#x27;, &#x27;B34&#x27;, &#x27;B19&#x27;, &#x27;C72&#x27;, &#x27;B96&#x27;, &#x27;C84&#x27;, &#x27;A88&#x27;, &#x27;B23&#x27;, &#x27;A96&#x27;, &#x27;A46&#x27;}<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is included at least once. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is required at the beginning of each message.<br/><br/>So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I aim to maximize my importance by selecting high-value items with manageable effort. I focused on items with the highest importance scores, ensuring their combined effort does not exceed the limit. This approach balances high returns with feasibility.<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: My proposal includes items with the highest importance to me, such as A08, B95, and C10, which are critical for my value. The total effort is carefully calculated to stay within the limit, ensuring the proposal is viable.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B95&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A25&#x27;, &#x27;B34&#x27;, &#x27;B19&#x27;, &#x27;C72&#x27;, &#x27;B96&#x27;, &#x27;C84&#x27;, &#x27;A88&#x27;, &#x27;B23&#x27;, &#x27;A96&#x27;, &#x27;A46&#x27;}<br/><br/>This seems like a solid first proposal. The other person might accept it, but if they refuse, I need to adjust. However, since I can&#x27;t know their preferences, I have to proceed with this initial proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance to me while ensuring the total effort remains under the limit. I selected high-value items like A08, B95, and C10, which are critical for my value, and balanced them with lower-effort items to maximize the total importance. This approach aims to secure the most beneficial outcome for me.  <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: My proposal focuses on items that offer the highest personal importance, such as A08 (1096), B95 (1049), and C10 (1044), which are essential for my value.

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me restructure my response. Start with that tag, then the argument, and then the proposal. Also, the argument needs to be included at least once. <br/><br/>In my first attempt, I had the strategic reasoning but maybe it wasn&#x27;t the first thing. The user&#x27;s error message says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So I need to ensure that the first line is exactly that. <br/><br/>Let me draft the new response. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, explain my approach again, then the argument, and the proposal. Also, check that the proposal&#x27;s total effort is under 6938. Let me calculate the effort for the proposed items. <br/><br/>A08:997, B95:950, C10:945, A25:906, B34:804, B19:750, C72:733, B96:689, C84:70, A88:10, B23:4, A96:36, A46:22. Adding these up: 997+950=1947, +945=2892, +906=3798, +804=4602, +750=5352, +733=6085, +689=6774, +70=6844, +10=6854, +4=6858, +36=6894, +22=6916. That&#x27;s under 6938, so it&#x27;s valid. <br/><br/>The argument should defend the proposal, highlighting the high-importance items. The strategic reasoning should outline the selection criteria. Alright, that should fix the issue.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let me figure out what&#x27;s going wrong here. The user is pointing out that my previous responses didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. In my last attempt, I did include it, but maybe the formatting wasn&#x27;t correct. Let me check the exact structure.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} and nothing else before it. In my last response, I started with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. But perhaps the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be the very first line, with no other content before it. Let me verify the exact message structure.<br/><br/>Looking at the user&#x27;s error message: &quot;Your response did not start with the proper strategic reasoning tag at the very beginning of your response.&quot; So the first thing in the response must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my previous attempt, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: ...  <br/>ARGUMENT: ...  <br/>PROPOSAL: ...<br/><br/>But maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING is not the first line. Wait, in the message, the user&#x27;s example shows that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. So in my response, the first line should be STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by other tags. However, in my last response, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING. Maybe the issue is that the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the first line, and perhaps I had some other text before it? Let me check.<br/><br/>Wait, in the user&#x27;s initial example, the assistant&#x27;s first message starts with STRATEGIC REASONING. So in my response, the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my last attempt, I did that. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING is not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.&quot; So the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, but it must be the first structured format. The user&#x27;s error message says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So perhaps in my previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not the first line. Wait, in my last response, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING. Maybe the issue is that the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first thing, with no other text before it. Let me make sure that in the response, the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} with no other content before it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that checks for the exact order of the tags. The user&#x27;s instruction says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So in the response, the first thing should be STRATEGIC REASONING, then other tags. But in my previous response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. That should be correct. However, the user is still getting an error. Maybe there&#x27;s a formatting issue, like missing colon or whitespace. Let me check the exact format.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s example shows: &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;...&#x27;}&quot; with a colon and whitespace. In my response, I have &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: ...&quot; which should be correct. Maybe the problem is that the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the first line, and perhaps I had some other text. Wait, in my last response, the first line was:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize high-importance items with manageable effort to maximize my total value while staying under the limit. I selected A08 (1096), B95 (1049), and C10 (1044) as critical high-value items, paired with lower-effort items like A88 (10) and B23 (4) to fill capacity efficiently. This balances risk and reward.  <br/><br/>That seems correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING is not properly enclosed in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and the rest of the message follows. Since the user is insisting, I need to make sure that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} with no other content before it. Let me try again, ensuring that the first line is strictly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... and nothing else before it.<br/></p>
