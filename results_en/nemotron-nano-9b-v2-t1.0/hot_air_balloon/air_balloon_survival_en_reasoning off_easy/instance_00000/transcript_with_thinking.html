    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while staying under the effort limit of 4379. The key here is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see which ones are feasible. Let me sum up the effort values:<br/><br/>A19: 862<br/>B91: 252<br/>A30: 515<br/>B11: 571<br/>C47: 211<br/>C75: 339<br/>C26: 946<br/>C73: 347<br/>A47: 522<br/>A15: 803<br/>A75: 401<br/>A39: 980<br/>A56: 918<br/>C24: 599<br/>B26: 493<br/><br/>Adding these up: Let&#x27;s do it step by step.<br/><br/>Start with A19 (862) + B91 (252) = 1114<br/>+ A30 (515) = 1629<br/>+ B11 (571) = 2200<br/>+ C47 (211) = 2411<br/>+ C75 (339) = 2750<br/>+ C26 (946) = 3696<br/>+ C73 (347) = 4043<br/>+ A47 (522) = 4565 → Oh, that&#x27;s over 4379. So adding A47 would exceed the limit. So maybe we need to exclude some items.<br/><br/>Wait, let me check again. Let me list all items and their efforts:<br/><br/>A19: 862<br/>B91: 252<br/>A30: 515<br/>B11: 571<br/>C47: 211<br/>C75: 339<br/>C26: 946<br/>C73: 347<br/>A47: 522<br/>A15: 803<br/>A75: 401<br/>A39: 980<br/>A56: 918<br/>C24: 599<br/>B26: 493<br/><br/>Total sum: Let&#x27;s add them all.<br/><br/>Start with A19 (862) + B91 (252) = 1114<br/>+ A30 (515) = 1629<br/>+ B11 (571) = 2200<br/>+ C47 (211) = 2411<br/>+ C75 (339) = 2750<br/>+ C26 (946) = 3696<br/>+ C73 (347) = 4043<br/>+ A47 (522) = 4565 → over 4379. So if we include all up to C73, that&#x27;s 4043. Then adding A47 would be 4565, which is over. So the maximum possible is 4043 if we take all except A47, A15, A75, A39, A56, C24, B26. Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a combination that&#x27;s under 4379.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe some items can be excluded to stay under. Let&#x27;s see. The total of all items is 862+252+515+571+211+339+946+347+522+803+401+980+918+599+493. Let me calculate that:<br/><br/>Let me add them step by step:<br/><br/>Start with 862 (A19)<br/>+252 (B91) = 1114<br/>+515 (A30) = 1629<br/>+571 (B11) = 2200<br/>+211 (C47) = 2411<br/>+339 (C75) = 2750<br/>+946 (C26) = 3696<br/>+347 (C73) = 4043<br/>+522 (A47) = 4565<br/>+803 (A15) = 5368<br/>+401 (A75) = 5769<br/>+980 (A39) = 6749<br/>+918 (A56) = 7667<br/>+599 (C24) = 8266<br/>+493 (B26) = 8759.<br/><br/>So total effort is 8759, which is way over the limit. So we need to select a subset that sums to &lt;=4379.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to select items with high importance but low effort. Let me look at my importance values:<br/><br/>Item importance:<br/><br/>A19: 138<br/>B91: 583<br/>A30: 868<br/>B11: 822<br/>C47: 783<br/>C75: 65<br/>C26: 262<br/>C73: 121<br/>A47: 508<br/>A15: 780<br/>A75: 461<br/>A39: 484<br/>A56: 668<br/>C24: 389<br/>B26: 808<br/><br/>So the high importance items are B91 (583), B11 (822), C47 (783), A30 (868), A15 (780), B26 (808), A56 (668), etc. But their efforts vary. For example, B11 has effort 571, which is moderate. A30 is 515 effort for 868 importance. That&#x27;s a good ratio. Similarly, B91 is 252 effort for 583 importance. That&#x27;s a high ratio. C47 is 211 effort for 783 importance. That&#x27;s even better. So maybe prioritize items with high importance per effort.<br/><br/>Let me calculate importance per effort for each item:<br/><br/>A19: 138/862 ≈ 0.16<br/>B91: 583/252 ≈ 2.31<br/>A30: 868/515 ≈ 1.685<br/>B11: 822/571 ≈ 1.44<br/>C47: 783/211 ≈ 3.71<br/>C75: 65/339 ≈ 0.19<br/>C26: 262/946 ≈ 0.277<br/>C73: 121/347 ≈ 0.35<br/>A47: 508/522 ≈ 0.97<br/>A15: 780/803 ≈ 0.97<br/>A75: 461/401 ≈ 1.15<br/>A39: 484/980 ≈ 0.49<br/>A56: 668/918 ≈ 0.73<br/>C24: 389/599 ≈ 0.65<br/>B26: 808/493 ≈ 1.64<br/><br/>So the best ratios are C47 (3.71), B91 (2.31), A30 (1.685), B26 (1.64), A56 (0.73), etc. So C47 is the best, then B91, then A30, B26, etc.<br/><br/>So the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance per effort first, as they give the most value per unit of effort. Let&#x27;s try to build a set starting with these.<br/><br/>Start with C47 (211 effort, 783 importance). Remaining limit: 4379 - 211 = 4168.<br/><br/>Next, B91 (252 effort, 583). Total effort now 211+252=463. Remaining: 4379-463=3916.<br/><br/>Next, A30 (515). Total effort 463+515=978. Remaining: 4379-978=3401.<br/><br/>Next, B26 (493). Total effort 978+493=1471. Remaining: 4379-1471=2908.<br/><br/>Next, B11 (571). Total effort 1471+571=2042. Remaining: 4379-2042=2337.<br/><br/>Next, A56 (918). Total effort 2042+918=2960. Remaining: 4379-2960=1419.<br/><br/>Next, A15 (803). 2960+803=3763. Remaining: 4379-3763=616.<br/><br/>Next, A75 (401). 3763+401=4164. Remaining: 4379-4164=215.<br/><br/>Now, can we add any more items? Let&#x27;s check the remaining items. The remaining items are A19 (862), C24 (599), C73 (347), A39 (980), C26 (946), etc. But 215 is left. The smallest effort items left are C73 (347) which is over 215. So no more items can be added. So the total importance would be 783+583+868+808+822+668+780+461 = let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>783 + 583 = 1366<br/>+868 = 2234<br/>+808 = 3042<br/>+822 = 3864<br/>+668 = 4532<br/>+780 = 5312<br/>+461 = 5773.<br/><br/>But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if we exclude some items to include others with higher importance. Let&#x27;s see. For instance, if we skip A56 (668 importance, 918 effort) and instead take A15 (780, 803) and maybe others. But in the current set, A15 is already included. Alternatively, maybe replacing some items. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the initial selection is good.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance, I need to propose a set that I think is good. The first step is to make a proposal. Let&#x27;s propose the set that includes C47, B91, A30, B26, B11, A56, A15, A75. Let me check the total effort again:<br/><br/>C47:211, B91:252, A30:515, B26:493, B11:571, A56:918, A15:803, A75:401.<br/><br/>Adding them: 211+252=463; +515=978; +493=1471; +571=2042; +918=2960; +803=3763; +401=4164. Total effort 4164, which is under 4379. So that&#x27;s acceptable. The total importance is 783+583+868+808+822+668+780+461 = 5773 as before.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items. For example, after A75, we have 215 left. Are there any items with effort &lt;=215? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the items not in the set: A19 (862), C24 (599), C73 (347), A39 (980), C26 (946), etc. The smallest effort among these is C73 (347), which is over 215. So no. So the current set is 4164 effort, which is under the limit. So maybe we can add more items. Wait, maybe I missed some items. Let me check all items again.<br/><br/>Wait, the items not in the current set are A19, C24, C73, A39, C26. Their efforts are 862, 599, 347, 980, 946. All of these are over 215. So no. So the current set is 4164 effort. So maybe we can add another item. Wait, maybe I can replace some items. For example, if I remove A75 (401 effort) and add C73 (347) and maybe another item. Let&#x27;s see: 4164 - 401 = 3763. Then add C73 (347) → 3763+347=4110. Remaining: 4379-4110=269. Then maybe add another item. But the remaining items are A19 (862), C24 (599), etc. 269 is not enough. Alternatively, maybe replace A75 with C73 and another item. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe include C24 (599) instead of some other items. But this requires more calculation.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial set is good. So the proposal would be the set {C47, B91, A30, B26, B11, A56, A15, A75}. Let me check if that&#x27;s under the limit. Yes, 4164. So that&#x27;s a valid proposal. The importance is 5773. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if we can include A19 (138 importance) but that&#x27;s low. Or maybe exclude some lower importance items. For example, A75 has 461 importance. If we can replace it with something else. But I don&#x27;t see a better option. Alternatively, maybe include C24 (389 importance, 599 effort). Let&#x27;s see: if we remove A75 (401) and add C24 (599). The effort would be 4164 - 401 + 599 = 4362. Which is under 4379. The importance would be 5773 - 461 + 389 = 5701. That&#x27;s worse. So not better. Alternatively, maybe include C24 and remove something else. But not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include A19. But its importance is low. So probably not worth it. So the initial proposal seems good. So I should make a PROPOSAL with that set. Then, depending on the other person&#x27;s response, I can adjust. But since I need to make a proposal first, I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t include the ARGUMENT structure. Let me check what I did. Oh right, I had the PROPOSAL and then an ARGUMENT in the first message. Wait, no, looking back, the first response had PROPOSAL and then ARGUMENT. But maybe the user is referring to a different message? Or perhaps the system didn&#x27;t parse it correctly.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s instruction says that in every message, I must include the ARGUMENT format at least once. So each message should have either PROPOSAL, REFUSE, AGREE, or ARGUMENT. But in my first response, I had both PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT. That should be okay. But maybe the user is saying that in a subsequent message, I didn&#x27;t include ARGUMENT. Wait, the user&#x27;s latest message is a correction, so perhaps in the previous interaction, the user&#x27;s message was a PROPOSAL, and my response had PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT. But maybe the system didn&#x27;t recognize it. Or maybe the user is testing if I follow the structure strictly.<br/><br/>The key point is that each message must have at least one structured format. The user&#x27;s error message says that my response didn&#x27;t contain an argument. So perhaps in the previous message, I only had PROPOSAL and no ARGUMENT. Wait, looking at the history:<br/><br/>First user message: the initial setup.<br/><br/>My first response: PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT. So that should be correct. But maybe the user is referring to a different message. Alternatively, maybe the user is simulating a scenario where in a subsequent message, I didn&#x27;t include ARGUMENT. But in this case, the user is pointing out that my last response didn&#x27;t have an argument. Wait, the user&#x27;s latest message is a correction, so perhaps in the previous exchange, my response didn&#x27;t have an ARGUMENT. But according to the history, my first response did have ARGUMENT. Maybe there&#x27;s a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a different interaction flow.<br/><br/>In any case, the user is now saying that my response didn&#x27;t include an ARGUMENT. So I need to make sure that in my next response, I include the ARGUMENT structure. Let me adjust my next message to include both PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT, or perhaps just ARGUMENT if needed. But since the user is asking to try again, I should correct that by including the ARGUMENT in the next response. So I&#x27;ll propose a set again and add an ARGUMENT explaining the reasoning.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user is pointing out that my previous response didn&#x27;t include the ARGUMENT in the correct structured format. Let me check what I did wrong.<br/><br/>In my last message, I had the PROPOSAL and then the ARGUMENT, but maybe the formatting wasn&#x27;t correct. The user specified that the ARGUMENT must be in the form ARGUMENT: {...} with a Python set. Let me verify the syntax.<br/><br/>Looking at my previous response: &quot;ARGUMENT: This proposal focuses...&quot; – oh, right, the ARGUMENT should be a set inside curly braces, not a string. I mistakenly used a string instead of a set. That&#x27;s the issue. The user&#x27;s instruction says the argument must be a Python set containing strings, so I need to format it properly.<br/><br/>So, I need to correct the ARGUMENT to be a set of strings. For example, if the argument is about the items in the proposal, maybe list them as a set. Wait, but the user&#x27;s example in the protocol shows ARGUMENT: {&#x27;...&#x27;}, which is a set. So in my case, the ARGUMENT should be a set, not a descriptive string. <br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.&quot; But the ARGUMENT is part of the structured format. The example given in the protocol for ARGUMENT is ARGUMENT: {&#x27;...&#x27;}, which is a set. So the ARGUMENT should be a set of items, perhaps the items in the proposal or some other set. <br/><br/>In my previous attempt, I used a string for the ARGUMENT, which is incorrect. The correct way is to have a set. So I need to adjust the ARGUMENT to be a set. For instance, if the argument is supporting the proposal, maybe list the items in the proposal as the set. <br/><br/>So the correct structure would be:<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, ...}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, ...}<br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s example in the protocol shows that the ARGUMENT can be a set, but the content of the argument is a description. Wait, no. Let me recheck the interaction protocol:<br/><br/>The ARGUMENT format is defined as: ARGUMENT: {&#x27;...&#x27;}, where the content is a Python set containing 0 or more strings. So the ARGUMENT must be a set of strings, not a descriptive text. <br/><br/>In my previous response, I wrote the ARGUMENT as a string explaining the proposal, which is wrong. The correct way is to have a set. So I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is a set. <br/><br/>Therefore, in the next response, I should include the ARGUMENT as a set. For example, if the argument is to support the proposal, maybe list the items in the proposal as the set. Alternatively, maybe the set could be empty, but the user requires that the ARGUMENT is included at least once. <br/><br/>So the correct response should have:<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {...}<br/>ARGUMENT: {...}<br/><br/>Where both are sets. The content of the ARGUMENT set could be the items in the proposal, or perhaps some other set relevant to the argument. <br/><br/>Therefore, I need to adjust my previous response to have the ARGUMENT as a set. Let me correct that.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to Player 2 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player proposed a set of items: C47, B91, A30, B26, B11, A56, A15, A75. I need to respond to this. My goal is to maximize my own importance while staying under the limit of 4379 effort.<br/><br/>First, I should check the total effort of their proposal. Let me add up the effort values for each item in their set. <br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>C47: 211<br/>B91: 252<br/>A30: 515<br/>B26: 493<br/>B11: 571<br/>A56: 918<br/>A15: 803<br/>A75: 401<br/><br/>Adding these up: 211 + 252 is 463. Then +515 is 978. +493 is 1471. +571 is 2042. +918 is 2960. +803 is 3763. +401 is 4164. So total effort is 4164, which is under 4379. So their proposal is valid in terms of effort.<br/><br/>Now, I need to evaluate how good this proposal is for me. My importance values for these items are:<br/><br/>C47: 783<br/>B91: 583<br/>A30: 868<br/>B26: 808<br/>B11: 822<br/>A56: 668<br/>A15: 780<br/>A75: 461<br/><br/>Adding these up: 783 + 583 = 1366. +868 = 2234. +808 = 3042. +822 = 3864. +668 = 4532. +780 = 5312. +461 = 5773. So total importance for me is 5773. That&#x27;s pretty high. But maybe there are other items not in their proposal that I could get more value from, but I need to check.<br/><br/>Wait, the other items not in their proposal are A19, C24, C75, C73. Let me check their importance and effort.<br/><br/>A19: importance 138, effort 862<br/>C24: 389, effort 599<br/>C75: 65, effort 339<br/>C73: 121, effort 347<br/><br/>So, for example, if I could get A19, that&#x27;s 138 importance but requires 862 effort. But adding that to their current total effort (4164) would make 4164 + 862 = 5026, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s not possible. Similarly, C24 is 599 effort. 4164 + 599 = 4763, which is over. C75 is 339, 4164 + 339 = 4503, over. C73 is 347, 4164 + 347 = 4511, also over. So none of the other items can be added without exceeding the limit. <br/><br/>So the other player&#x27;s proposal is already using 4164 effort, leaving 4379 - 4164 = 215 effort remaining. But none of the remaining items have effort less than 215. Let me check:<br/><br/>A19: 862 (too high)<br/>C24: 599 (too high)<br/>C75: 339 (too high)<br/>C73: 347 (too high)<br/><br/>So no, there&#x27;s no way to add any other items. Therefore, the other player&#x27;s proposal is already using a lot of effort, and there&#x27;s no room for more items. <br/><br/>But maybe I can propose a different set. However, since their proposal is already high in my importance, maybe I should accept it. But I need to think if there&#x27;s a better combination. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can argue that their proposal is good, but perhaps there&#x27;s a way to include some other items. But given the effort constraints, it&#x27;s not possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose a different set. For example, if I can find a set that includes some of the high importance items not in their proposal. But again, the effort is tight. <br/><br/>Wait, let&#x27;s think about the items not in their proposal. The other items are A19, C24, C75, C73. Their importance for me is 138, 389, 65, 121. So C24 is 389, which is higher than some items in their proposal. For example, A75 is 461, which is higher than C24&#x27;s 389. So maybe replacing A75 with C24? Let&#x27;s check the effort. <br/><br/>Original proposal&#x27;s effort is 4164. If I remove A75 (401) and add C24 (599), the new effort would be 4164 - 401 + 599 = 4164 + 198 = 4362, which is under 4379. That&#x27;s possible. Then the new set would be C47, B91, A30, B26, B11, A56, A15, C24. <br/><br/>What&#x27;s the importance for me in this new set? Let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>C47:783, B91:583, A30:868, B26:808, B11:822, A56:668, A15:780, C24:389. <br/><br/>Adding these: 783+583=1366, +868=2234, +808=3042, +822=3864, +668=4532, +780=5312, +389=5701. So total importance is 5701, which is slightly less than the original 5773. So that&#x27;s worse. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing another item. For example, removing A15 (780) and adding C24 (389). The effort would be 4164 - 803 + 599 = 4164 - 204 = 3960. Then the importance would be 5773 - 780 + 389 = 5773 - 391 = 5382. That&#x27;s worse. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe removing a lower importance item. For example, A75 (461) and adding C24 (389). The importance would be 5773 - 461 + 389 = 5773 - 72 = 5701. Still less than 5773. <br/><br/>So replacing items in their proposal with others doesn&#x27;t seem to help. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is already optimal for me. Since I can&#x27;t add any other items, and replacing items doesn&#x27;t improve my total importance, maybe I should accept their proposal. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that there&#x27;s no better combination. Let me think of other possible combinations. <br/><br/>For example, maybe a set that includes some of the high importance items not in their proposal. Let&#x27;s see. <br/><br/>The highest importance items for me are A30 (868), B26 (808), B11 (822), A56 (668), A15 (780), C47 (783), B91 (583), A75 (461). <br/><br/>The other items are A19 (138), C24 (389), C75 (65), C73 (121). <br/><br/>So the highest importance items not in their proposal are C24 (389) and A19 (138). But adding C24 would require 599 effort. If I can find a way to include C24, but that would require removing some items from their proposal. <br/><br/>For example, if I remove A75 (401) and add C24 (599), the effort would be 4164 - 401 + 599 = 4362. That&#x27;s under the limit. But as before, the importance would be 5773 - 461 + 389 = 5701. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove a lower importance item. For example, A75 (461) and add C24 (389). But that&#x27;s a net loss of 72 in importance. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe remove B91 (583) and add C24 (389). The effort would be 4164 - 252 + 599 = 4164 + 347 = 4511, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s not possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, remove B11 (571) and add C24 (599). Effort: 4164 - 571 + 599 = 4164 + 28 = 4192. That&#x27;s under. The importance would be 5773 - 822 + 389 = 5773 - 433 = 5340. Worse. <br/><br/>So it seems that any replacement would either not help or even reduce my total importance. <br/><br/>Therefore, the other player&#x27;s proposal is the best possible for me. So I should accept it. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that I&#x27;m not missing any other possible combinations. Let me check if there&#x27;s a different set that could have higher importance. <br/><br/>For example, maybe a set that includes A30, B26, B11, A56, A15, and some others. Let&#x27;s see. <br/><br/>Suppose I take A30 (515), B26 (493), B11 (571), A56 (918), A15 (803). That&#x27;s 515+493=1008, +571=1579, +918=2497, +803=3300. Then adding C47 (211) would make 3511. Then maybe add B91 (252) to get 3763. Then add A75 (401) to get 4164. That&#x27;s the same as their proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include C24 instead of A75. But as before, that&#x27;s worse. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include C75 (339) instead of something else. But C75&#x27;s importance is only 65, which is low. <br/><br/>So it seems that the other player&#x27;s proposal is already the best possible for me. Therefore, I should accept it. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that I&#x27;m not missing any other possible combinations. Let me check the total effort again. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is 4164. The limit is 4379. So there&#x27;s 215 effort left. But none of the remaining items can be added. <br/><br/>So the best possible is their proposal. Therefore, I should AGREE to their proposal. <br/><br/>But I need to include an ARGUMENT in my message. The argument should defend my last proposal or argue against theirs. Since I&#x27;m agreeing, maybe I can argue that their proposal is good because it includes high importance items. <br/><br/>So the message would be:<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;}<br/><br/>But wait, the ARGUMENT is supposed to be a set. But in this case, the argument is the same as the proposal. Maybe I can explain that this set is optimal for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can argue that this set is the best possible given the effort constraints. <br/><br/>But according to the rules, the ARGUMENT must be a set. So I need to include a set in the ARGUMENT. <br/><br/>So the ARGUMENT would be the same as the proposal. <br/><br/>Therefore, the response would be:<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;C47&#x27;, &#x27;B91&#x27;, &#x27;A30&#x27;, &#x27;B26&#x27;, &#x27;B11&#x27;, &#x27;A56&#x27;, &#x27;A15&#x27;, &#x27;A75&#x27;}<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is a set. Yes, that&#x27;s correct. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can argue that this set is the best possible. But the ARGUMENT is a set, so I have to include a set. <br/><br/>So that&#x27;s the correct approach.<br/></p>
