                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer. My value function is statue:3, nail:1, hammer:0. So I value statues the most, then nails, and hammers are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since it's a cooperative game, I should assume they have their own preferences. But since I don't know theirs, maybe I should focus on items that are valuable to me and see if there's a way to get as much as possible while leaving something for them. Wait, but the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So maybe I should try to get items that are valuable to both, but since I don't know their values, perhaps I need to make a proposal that covers all items, but in a way that both can get something.\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the total items requested by both don't exceed the available quantities.\n\nSo, for example, if I propose to take 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer, and the other player proposes something else, but if their proposal doesn't overlap in a way that the total items are available, then we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's proposal, doesn't exceed the available items.\n\nBut since I don't know the other's value function, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me, but also leave some items for them. However, since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose all the items I value, and hope that the other player can take the rest. But if I take all the statues, nails, and hammer, then the other player can't take anything, which would result in zero. That's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose some items and leave others for them. For example, if I take 2 statues and 1 nail, and leave 1 statue and 1 hammer for them. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn't require more than what's left. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, but also allows for some items to be available for the other player.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the other player's proposal is also a secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me, but not all of them, so that there's something left for them. For example, if I take 2 statues and 1 nail, then there's 1 statue and 1 hammer left. If the other player can take those, then the total would be 2+1 (my items) plus whatever they take. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should just propose the items I value the most, and hope that the other player can take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, but that might not be good. Let me think. If I take all 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer, then the other player can't take anything. So the total score would be my value (3*3 +1*1 +1*0=10) plus zero, which is 10. But if I leave some items, maybe the other player can take them, and the total could be higher. For example, if I take 2 statues and 1 nail (value 2*3 +1*1=7), and the other player takes 1 statue and 1 hammer (assuming they value the statue and hammer). If their value for statue is, say, 2, then their total would be 2 + 0 (if hammer is 0 for them) = 2. Total would be 7+2=9, which is less than 10. But if their value for hammer is higher, maybe. But since I don't know, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 statues and 1 nail, and leave the hammer. Then the other player can take the hammer. If they value the hammer, that's good. But if they don't, then they get zero. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to leave the hammer. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 statues and 1 nail, and the other player can take the hammer. But if the other player's value for hammer is zero, then they get nothing. But if they value it, then it's better. But since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the items I value, and hope that the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the proposal.\n\nWait, the secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to make a secret proposal. The other player will do the same. Then, if the combined proposals don't exceed the available items, we get the scores. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's proposal, doesn't exceed the available items. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, but also allows for some items to be available for them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take all the items I value, and the other player can take the rest. But if I take all, then the other player can't take anything. So that's bad. So maybe I should leave some items. For example, take 2 statues and 1 nail, leaving 1 statue and 1 hammer. Then the other player can take those. If they value the statue and hammer, that's good. But if they don't, then they get nothing. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to leave the hammer, which I don't value, so the other player might take it if they value it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 statues and 1 nail, and the other player can take the hammer. But if the other player's value for hammer is zero, then they get nothing. But if they value it, then it's better. But again, without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 statues and 1 nail, and the other player can take the hammer. But if the other player's proposal is to take the hammer, then the total would be 3+1 (my items) + 1 (hammer) if they take it. But if they don't, then it's zero. But since I can't know, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player can take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 statues and 1 nail, and the other player can take the hammer. But if the other player's proposal is to take the hammer, then the total is 3+1 + 1 (if they value it). But if they don't, then zero.

But if the other player's value for hammer is zero, then they get nothing. But if they value it, then it's better. But since I don't know, maybe I should just proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 statues and 1 nail, and the other player can take the hammer. But if the other player's proposal is to take the hammer, then the total is 3+1 + 1 (if they value it). But if they don't, then zero.

My value function is statue: 0, nail: 1, hammer: 9. So I really value the hammer a lot, and the nail a little, but statues don't matter to me.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. That means I should try to get as much value as possible for myself while also ensuring the other player gets enough to make a deal. Since we can send up to 5 messages each, but maybe we can do it in fewer steps.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their value function, I have to make some assumptions. But maybe I can structure a proposal that gives them something they might want, while I get the hammer.\n\nThe hammer is worth 9 to me. If I can get the hammer, that's a big gain. The nail is only worth 1, so maybe I can give that to the other player if they need it. The statues are worthless to me, so I can give those away.\n\nBut how to propose this? The secret proposal format is [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send a message with that format. Let me think about what to propose.\n\nIf I propose to take the hammer and maybe the nail, but the other player might need the nail. Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the hammer and give the nail and statues to the other player. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary.\n\nWait, but since I don't know their value function, maybe I should propose something that's likely to be acceptable. For example, if I take the hammer (which is valuable to me) and give the nail and statues to the other player. If their value function values the nail or statues, that could work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and the nail, but that might not be good if the other player also wants the nail. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to give the nail to them.\n\nSo my secret proposal could be: [Proposal: 1 hammer, 1 nail]. But wait, there's only 1 nail. If I take the nail, then the other player can't have it. But if I give the nail to them, maybe they can take it. But I need to make sure that their proposal is compatible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and leave the nail and statues for the other player. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hammer]. Then the other player might propose to take the nail and statues. If that's the case, then both proposals are complementary. But I need to check if that's possible.\n\nBut since I can't see their proposal, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since the hammer is so valuable to me, I should definitely try to get it. The other player might not value the hammer as much, so maybe they would accept my proposal if I take the hammer and give them the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and the nail, but that might not be good if the other player also wants the nail. But since I don't know, perhaps it's better to take the hammer and give the nail to them. Let me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I propose [Proposal: 1 hammer], then the other player might propose something else. If their proposal is to take the nail and statues, then that's complementary. If they propose to take the hammer, then it's not complementary. But since I don't know, maybe I should make a proposal that's as attractive as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and the nail, but that might not be optimal. Wait, the nail is only worth 1 to me. If I take the nail, I get 1, but if I give it to the other player, maybe they get more value. But since I don't know their value function, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and leave the nail and statues. That way, the other player can take the nail and statues. If their value function values the nail or statues, that's good. If not, maybe they can't get anything, but since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe it's better to have both get something.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the hammer and see. So my first message would be the secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 hammer]. Then, if the other player responds with a proposal that includes the nail and statues, that's good. If they propose something else, maybe we can adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and the nail, but that might not be necessary. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...], and if the proposals are complementary, both get their scores. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the hammer and the nail, but that might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hammer and the statues, but statues are worthless to me. Wait, but if I give the statues to the other player, maybe they value them. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hammer and give the nail to the other player. So my proposal is [Proposal: 1 hammer], and then the other player might propose to take the nail. If that's the case, then both get their items. But if the other player also wants the hammer, then it's a conflict.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the hammer. Let me go with that. So my first message is the secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 hammer]. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust. But since the other player hasn't responded yet, I need to make this proposal.\n",

But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they have a certain allocation in mind. My job is to propose something that complements theirs. If our proposals together don't exceed the available items, we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, we get zero.\n\nSince I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Let's think about possible scenarios. If they proposed taking some statues, maybe I should take the rest. But since I value statues highly, I should try to get as many as possible. However, if they also want statues, there might be a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they proposed taking the nail or hammer. Since the hammer is worthless to me, but maybe they value it. If they took the hammer, I could take the nail and statues. But without knowing their proposal, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning the total items requested by both don't exceed the available items. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn't exceed the available quantities.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose something that covers the items I value most. For example, take all 3 statues and the nail. That way, if they didn't take those, we can both get them. But if they did take some, maybe there's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 2 statues and the nail. That leaves 1 statue and the hammer. If they take the remaining statue and hammer, that's possible. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a safe bet.\n\nAnother approach: since the hammer is worthless to me, maybe I should leave it for them. But if they value it, they might take it. But since I don't know, perhaps I should focus on the items I value.\n\nSo my proposal should be to take as many statues as possible and the nail. Let's say I propose 3 statues and 1 nail. That's [Proposal: 3 statues, 1 nail]. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those items, then we can both get them. If they did, then maybe there's a conflict. But since I don't know, this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 statues and 1 nail. That leaves 1 statue and the hammer. If they take the remaining statue and hammer, that's okay. But if they also want the nail, then there's a conflict. But since I don't know, maybe this is a safer approach.\n\nWait, but the other player's proposal is secret. So I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe the best way is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Since I can't know, but the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps I should propose items that are valuable to me and leave the less valuable ones for them.\n\nSo, my proposal would be 3 statues and 1 nail. That's the maximum I can get. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then we both get them. If they do, then maybe we have to split. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n",
