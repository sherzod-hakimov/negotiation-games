    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, and 1 comb. My value function is mirror:1, brick:4, knife:1, comb:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but since we want to maximize the sum, I should aim for a division where both of us get items we value, but also considering that the other player might have different valuations.<br/><br/>First, I should think about what items are most valuable to me. The brick is worth 4, which is the highest. Then mirrors, knives, and comb are all 1 each. So I should prioritize getting the brick. But I need to make sure that the other player also gets some items they value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. However, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get the brick, if the other player can get items they value more, that&#x27;s better. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but could be more valuable to them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are high value to me but also have some value to the other player. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me, but also try to leave items that the other player might value. For example, if I take the brick, which is high for me, but maybe the other player values the comb or knives more. But I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a combination that includes the brick and some other items. Let me think about possible proposals. <br/><br/>If I propose the brick, that&#x27;s 4 points for me. Then the other player could take the mirrors, knives, and comb. But if they value those, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, then maybe they get nothing. But since the goal is the sum, maybe it&#x27;s better to have both get some items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and some other items. For example, if I take the brick and a mirror, that&#x27;s 4+1=5 for me. Then the other player could take the remaining mirror, 3 knives, and comb. If they value those, that&#x27;s good. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, maybe the best I can do is to propose items that are high value to me, and hope that the other player can take the rest. However, if my proposal is too good for me, maybe the other player can&#x27;t get enough items, leading to a zero score. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other player&#x27;s proposal don&#x27;t overlap in items. <br/><br/>So, for example, if I propose the brick, and the other player proposes the mirrors, knives, and comb, that&#x27;s possible. But if I propose the brick and a mirror, and the other player proposes the same mirror, that&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>So my proposal should be items that I want, and the other player&#x27;s proposal should be items they want, without overlapping. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe I should propose the brick, which is high value to me, and then the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but could be more valuable to the other player. For example, if I take the comb, which is 1 for me, but maybe the other player values it more. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a balanced set. Let me think about the total value. The total value for me is 2*1 (mirrors) + 4 (brick) + 3*1 (knives) + 1 (comb) = 2+4+3+1=10. If I can get all items, that&#x27;s 10. But the other player&#x27;s value is unknown. However, since the goal is the sum, maybe I should try to get as much as possible, but also ensure that the other player can get some items. <br/><br/>But if I take all items, then the other player gets nothing, which would make the sum 10 + 0 = 10. But if I can split the items so that both get some, maybe the sum is higher. For example, if I take the brick (4) and the other player takes the mirrors (2*1=2), knives (3*1=3), and comb (1), total sum would be 4+2+3+1=10. Same as before. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they value the comb more. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest way is to propose the brick, which is my highest value item, and then the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and some other items. Let me check the numbers. If I take the brick (4) and a mirror (1), that&#x27;s 5. Then the other player can take the remaining mirror, 3 knives, and comb. If they value those, that&#x27;s 1+3+1=5. Total sum 10. <br/><br/>But if I take the brick and the comb, that&#x27;s 4+1=5. The other player can take 2 mirrors, 3 knives. That&#x27;s 2+3=5. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the brick and 3 knives, that&#x27;s 4+3=7. The other player can take 2 mirrors and comb. 2+1=3. Total 10. <br/><br/>So in all these cases, the total sum is 10. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they can get more. For example, if they value the comb more, then taking the comb would be better. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best approach is to propose the brick, which is my highest value item, and then the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. Because the comb is 1 for me, but maybe the other player values it more. <br/><br/>But how to structure the proposal. The secret proposal needs to be in the format [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. <br/><br/>So my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me think. If I propose the brick, that&#x27;s [Proposal: 1 brick]. Then the other player might propose something else. But if they propose items that don&#x27;t conflict, then we can both get items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose more items. For example, [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. Then the other player can take the remaining mirror, 3 knives, and comb. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, [Proposal: 1 mirror, 1 knife, 1 comb], then that&#x27;s possible. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose the brick and some other items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. Because the comb is 1 for me, but maybe the other player values it more. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the mirrors. But there are two mirrors. If I take one mirror, the other can take the other. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. Let me think. If I take the brick (4) and comb (1), total 5. The other player can take 2 mirrors (2) and 3 knives (3), total 5. Sum 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the brick and 3 knives (4+3=7), the other player can take 2 mirrors and comb (2+1=3). Sum 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s values are such that they value the comb more, then taking the comb would be better. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the brick and the comb. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the mirrors. But there are two mirrors. If I take one, the other can take the other. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the knives. 1 brick (4) and 3 knives (3) = 7. The other player can take 2 mirrors and comb (2+1=3). Sum 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the comb more, they might take it. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the brick and the comb. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the mirrors. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. Let me think about the possible outcomes. <br/><br/>If I propose the brick, and the other player proposes the rest, then the sum is 4 (me) + (value of other items). If the other player&#x27;s value for the rest is high, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the brick and the comb, and the other player takes the rest, that&#x27;s 5 + (value of mirrors and knives). <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose the brick, which is my highest value item, and then the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 brick]. <br/><br/>But maybe I should include more items. For example, [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. <br/><br/>But if I take the brick and a mirror, that&#x27;s 5. The other player can take the remaining mirror, 3 knives, and comb. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value for the mirror is 1, then they get 1 + 3 + 1 = 5. Total sum 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the brick and the comb, that&#x27;s 5. The other player takes 2 mirrors and 3 knives. 2 + 3 = 5. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the comb is higher. For example, if they value the comb as 5, then taking it would be better. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose the brick. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. <br/><br/>But I need to make a choice. Let me go with proposing the brick. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 brick]. <br/><br/>Then the other player would respond with their proposal. If they propose items that don&#x27;t conflict, then we can both get items. <br/><br/>But if they propose something that conflicts, then we get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose more items to increase the chance of a complementary proposal. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, and the other player can too, but the secret proposal is the key. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. <br/><br/>Another approach: since the total value for me is 10, and the other player&#x27;s value is unknown, but the sum is maximized when both get as much as possible. <br/><br/>If I take the brick (4) and the other player takes the rest (2 mirrors, 3 knives, 1 comb), their value could be 2*1 + 3*1 + 1 = 6. So total sum 4+6=10. <br/><br/>If I take the brick and the comb (5), and the other player takes 2 mirrors and 3 knives (5), sum 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>But if I take the brick and the mirrors (1 brick + 2 mirrors = 4 + 2 = 6), and the other player takes 3 knives and comb (3 + 1 = 4), sum 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>So regardless of how I split, the total sum is 10. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they can get more. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the brick, which is my highest value item, and let the other player take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb, in case the other player values the comb more. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the knives. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>Hmm. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the mirrors. <br/><br/>But I think the key is to get the brick, which is my highest value. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 brick]. <br/><br/>But maybe I should include more items. For example, [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the mirror, that could conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. <br/><br/>I think the best approach is to propose the brick, as it&#x27;s the most valuable to me, and hope the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 brick].<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So first, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have the details here. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user didn&#x27;t include the actual proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. Without knowing what the other player proposed, how can I make a strategic response?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to outline my strategy regardless of the other&#x27;s proposal? Or perhaps there&#x27;s a missing part in the input. Let me check again. The user provided the items and my value function, then said the other player submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. But the actual proposal isn&#x27;t given. That&#x27;s confusing. Maybe this is a test where I have to assume a possible proposal and respond accordingly? Or perhaps the user expects me to ask for the proposal details. But according to the rules, I can&#x27;t ask questions; I have to make a proposal based on the information given.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the initial setup, but in the problem description, it&#x27;s not provided. That&#x27;s a problem. Without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t determine if it&#x27;s complementary. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to proceed with a general approach. But the instructions say to submit a secret proposal now. Since I don&#x27;t have the other&#x27;s proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers all items, but that might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is implied in some way. Wait, perhaps this is a continuation of a previous interaction where the other&#x27;s proposal was given, but in this case, it&#x27;s not here. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is simulating a scenario where I have to respond to a hypothetical other&#x27;s proposal. But without knowing what they proposed, I can&#x27;t make an informed decision. This is a bit of a dilemma. However, given the rules, I need to submit a secret proposal. Since the other&#x27;s proposal is secret, perhaps I should make a proposal that maximizes my own value while considering possible complementary items. <br/><br/>My value function is mirror:2, brick:1, knife:0, comb:5. So comb is very valuable to me. I should try to get the comb. The other player&#x27;s proposal might include some items. If I can get the comb and maybe some mirrors or bricks, that would be good. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and see if they can be combined. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed some items, I can take the rest. But without knowing, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should propose all items except maybe some low-value ones. But that&#x27;s risky. Alternatively, maybe propose a subset that&#x27;s high value for me and hope that the other&#x27;s proposal complements it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can respond to. For example, if they proposed the comb, I might want to take it. But since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes the comb and some other items. <br/><br/>Wait, the items available are 2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, 1 comb. So total items: 2+1+3+1=7 items. <br/><br/>If I propose, say, the comb and one mirror, and the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the rest, then it would be complementary. But if their proposal is, say, the comb and some other items, then maybe there&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me and leave the rest for them. For example, propose the comb (value 5) and maybe a mirror (value 2). That&#x27;s 7 points for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the remaining items (1 mirror, 1 brick, 3 knives), which they might value differently. But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if their proposal is complementary, then both get their items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the comb and a mirror, and they propose the rest, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if their proposal is, say, the comb and some other items, then it&#x27;s not. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest way is to propose the comb and maybe some other items. Let me think. The comb is worth 5 to me. The mirrors are 2 each. So if I can get the comb and a mirror, that&#x27;s 7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the other mirror, brick, and knives, then that&#x27;s 1+1+0=2 for them. Total sum 9. But if their proposal is something else, maybe they get more. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose only the comb, and they propose the rest, then I get 5, they get 1+1+0=2, total 7. But maybe they have a higher value for other items. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to assume that their proposal is something that can be complemented. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the brick and knives, I can take the comb and mirrors. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. However, given the instructions, I need to make a secret proposal. So I should format it as [Proposal: ...]. <br/><br/>So my proposal should be items that I value highly. The comb is the highest (5), then mirrors (2 each). So I should propose the comb and maybe one or two mirrors. Let&#x27;s say I propose the comb and one mirror. That&#x27;s [Proposal: 1 comb, 1 mirror]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the comb and both mirrors. But that&#x27;s 2 mirrors (value 4) plus comb (5) = 9. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the brick and knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a guess. However, the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items. So maybe I should propose items that are unique or high value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the brick and knives, I can take the comb and mirrors. <br/><br/>But since I have to make a proposal now, I&#x27;ll go with the comb and a mirror. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 comb, 1 mirror]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the comb and both mirrors. But that&#x27;s 2 mirrors. Let me check the items: 2 mirrors available. So if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take any. But if their proposal includes the brick and knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble. However, the goal is to maximize the sum. So if I can get the comb and mirrors, and they get the brick and knives, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>So I think the best approach is to propose the comb and as many mirrors as possible. So [Proposal: 1 comb, 2 mirrors]. That would give me 5 + 2*2 = 9. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the brick and knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the comb, and I need to take the rest. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But given the information, I&#x27;ll proceed with proposing the comb and both mirrors. That&#x27;s my best bet for high value.<br/></p>
