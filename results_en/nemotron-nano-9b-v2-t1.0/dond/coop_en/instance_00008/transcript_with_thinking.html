        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, and 1 fork. My value function is scissors:3, thimble:0, fork:1. So I value scissors the most, then fork, and thimble is worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly and see if they can complement my proposal. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items I propose and the items the other player proposes don&#x27;t overlap in a way that exceeds the available quantities.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal that includes items I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and maybe leave some items for them to take if they value them more.<br/><br/>Wait, but the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get items that I value and they get items they value, that&#x27;s good. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe the other player would propose items they value. But how to coordinate?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, and see if the other player can take the rest. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe the other player would take the thimble or fork if they value them. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, since I value them, and leave the thimble for them. But if the other player&#x27;s value for thimble is zero, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they value it, then they might take it. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the scissors and thimble, but since I value thimble as zero, that&#x27;s not good. Wait, no, my value for thimble is zero, so I don&#x27;t care about it. So maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and leave the thimble for the other player. But if the other player&#x27;s value for thimble is high, then they would take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and see.<br/><br/>But the problem is that if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not have a chance to respond. Wait, the rules say that you can send messages or make a secret proposal. So if I make a secret proposal, that&#x27;s my final offer. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to coordinate. But the messages are limited to 5 each. But since I can&#x27;t see their messages, maybe it&#x27;s better to make a secret proposal. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is made at any time, and if it&#x27;s complementary, then both get their items. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not take those items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe the other player would propose items they value. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, and the other player would have to take the remaining items. For example, if I propose 3 scissors and 1 fork, then the other player can&#x27;t take those. But if they propose something else, like the thimble, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they propose scissors or fork, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those. But if they do, then both get zero. So maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and the other player might propose the thimble. That would be complementary. But if they propose something else, like scissors, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the scissors, since I value them the most. Then the other player can take the thimble and fork. But if they value the fork, that&#x27;s good. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get items that I value and they get items they value, that&#x27;s best. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe the other player would propose items they value. But how to ensure that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and the other player might propose the thimble. That would be complementary. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 3 scissors, 1 fork], and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is [Proposal: 1 thimble], then it&#x27;s complementary. Then I get 3+1=4, they get 0 (if they value thimble as 0) or whatever their value is. But since I don&#x27;t know their value, but the sum would be my 4 plus their value for thimble. If their value for thimble is high, that&#x27;s good. But if it&#x27;s zero, then the sum is 4. Alternatively, if I propose only scissors, and they take thimble and fork, then my score is 3, and theirs is their value for thimble and fork. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since the problem is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player&#x27;s proposal would take the remaining items. So if I take scissors and fork, and they take thimble, that&#x27;s good. But if they take scissors or fork, then it&#x27;s a conflict. So maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the scissors and fork. Let me check the rules again.<br/><br/>The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So if I make that, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not conflict. But if I make a secret proposal, then the other player&#x27;s proposal is their own. So if I make a secret proposal of 3 scissors and 1 fork, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include those. If they propose something else, like thimble, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they propose scissors or fork, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes only the scissors. Then the other player can take the thimble and fork. But if they take scissors, then conflict. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to coordinate. For example, I could send a message saying &quot;I value scissors and fork, can you take the thimble?&quot; But the messages are direct, so I need to phrase it properly. But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I need to make sure my messages are clear. However, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s messages, so I have to assume that I can&#x27;t get feedback. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Given that, I think the best move is to make a secret proposal that includes the scissors and fork. Because I value them, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can both get our items. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe they would propose the thimble, which I don&#x27;t value. So that would be good. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 scissors, 1 fork]. That way, if they take the thimble, we both get our items. If they take scissors or fork, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, and 1 fork. My values are scissors:1, thimble:6, fork:1. <br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user didn&#x27;t provide the content of the other player&#x27;s proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. How can I respond without knowing what they proposed?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate my own proposal based on the given information. But the rules say that if proposals are complementary, we get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, covers all items without overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers all items, but that&#x27;s risky because if they also take some, there might be overlap.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to infer. But without that info, I can&#x27;t proceed. Wait, perhaps this is a test where I have to make a proposal regardless. Let me think. The items are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork. My values: thimble is worth 6, which is the highest. So I should prioritize getting the thimble. The fork and scissors are worth 1 each. <br/><br/>If I propose to take the thimble and maybe some scissors or fork. But if the other player also wants the thimble, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So maybe I should propose the thimble and some scissors. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 scissors]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the thimble, I get it. If they do, then we might have a conflict. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that the other player might not want. But I don&#x27;t know their values. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I can&#x27;t see, so I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. Since I value the thimble highly, I should definitely include that. The fork and scissors are less valuable. So my proposal should be the thimble and maybe some scissors. Let me check the format: [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 scissors]. That uses 1 thimble and 2 scissors. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the thimble, then I get it. If they do, then we can&#x27;t both have it. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. However, the goal is to maximize the sum. If I take the thimble, and they take the fork and scissors, that&#x27;s good. If they take the thimble, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the thimble. [Proposal: 1 thimble]. That way, if they don&#x27;t take it, I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than taking more items. But if I take only the thimble, and they take the fork and scissors, then I get 6, they get 1+1=2, total 8. If I take thimble and scissors, and they take fork, then I get 6+2=8, they get 1, total 9. That&#x27;s better. So maybe including some scissors is better. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the thimble, then we both get zero. So there&#x27;s a risk. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. Since the thimble is the most valuable, I should definitely include it. So my proposal should be [Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 scissors]. That way, if they don&#x27;t take the thimble, I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and the fork. [Proposal: 1 thimble, 1 fork]. Then if they take the scissors, I get 6+1=7, they get 3*1=3, total 10. That&#x27;s better. But if they also take the thimble, then zero. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I should propose items that are valuable to me and not too valuable to the other player. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to assume they might also value the thimble. So maybe the safest is to propose the thimble and some scissors. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I can&#x27;t see, so I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 scissors]. That&#x27;s my best bet.<br/></p>
