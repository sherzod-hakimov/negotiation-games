        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. My value function is phone:4, mirror:2, fruit:1. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we want to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider that they might have different valuations. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should aim for a division that gives both of us items we value, but also considering that if we can&#x27;t agree, we get nothing.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items&#x27; values. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make sure that the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities. <br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should start by proposing something that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t known. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also leave some for the other player. For example, if I take the phone (which I value 4), but maybe the other player also values it. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them? But again, I don&#x27;t know their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, but in a way that the other player can also get some items. For example, if I take the phone and one mirror, and leave the other mirror and two fruits for them. But I need to make sure that their proposal would also fit. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is a way to end the negotiation early. If I make a secret proposal, the other player would have to accept it if it&#x27;s complementary. But how does that work? The secret proposal is my final offer. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, then we get the scores. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe making a secret proposal is risky. Alternatively, maybe I should send messages to negotiate. But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s responses are not known. So perhaps the best approach is to make a secret proposal that is as good as possible for both.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get a high score, if the other player gets nothing, the total is lower. So I need to find a division where both get items they value. But without knowing their values, how?<br/><br/>Maybe I should assume that the other player has similar or different values. For example, if I take the phone (4), and they take the mirrors (each mirror is 2 for me, but maybe they value them more). But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best strategy is to propose items that I value, but leave some for the other player. For example, propose the phone and one mirror. Then, if the other player proposes the other mirror and two fruits, that would be complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and both mirrors. But then the other player would need to take the two fruits. But if they don&#x27;t value fruits, maybe they would reject. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the other mirror and two fruits. That way, both get items. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the safest way is to make a secret proposal that is as balanced as possible. For example, propose the phone and one mirror. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the other mirror and two fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they propose something else, maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and both mirrors. Then the other player can take the two fruits. But if they don&#x27;t value fruits, they might not accept. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the other mirror and one fruit. But that leaves one fruit unassigned. Wait, the total items are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, 2 fruits. So if I take phone and one mirror, and the other takes the other mirror and one fruit, that&#x27;s all items. That would be complementary. So that&#x27;s a possible proposal.<br/><br/>But how to structure this. The secret proposal needs to be in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose. Since I want to maximize the sum, I should propose items that I value, but also leave items that the other player might value. But without knowing their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me, but also have some items that are low value for me but maybe high for them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the phone and one mirror. That&#x27;s 4 + 2 = 6 for me. Then the other player could take the other mirror and two fruits. If they value mirrors and fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they would reject. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe this is a good balance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and both mirrors. That&#x27;s 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. Then the other player would need to take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, they might not accept. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the other mirror and one fruit. That way, all items are distributed. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that is likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send messages to negotiate. For example, first message: &quot;I value the phone highly. What do you think?&quot; But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I need to be careful not to include any response to the rules. So maybe just send a proposal.<br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the negotiation. So the first step is to send a message or make a secret proposal. Since the user is the one starting, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But the secret proposal is a final offer. If I make a secret proposal, the other player would have to accept it if it&#x27;s complementary. But if they don&#x27;t, then both get zero. So maybe it&#x27;s better to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message first. For example, &quot;I&#x27;m willing to take the phone and one mirror. What about you?&quot; But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I need to make sure that my messages are just the proposals. Wait, the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, so I can&#x27;t include any text except the proposal. So maybe I should just send a proposal.<br/><br/>But the user is the one starting. So the first message would be my proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, that&#x27;s my final offer. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, then we get the scores. Otherwise, zero. So if I make a secret proposal, I need to make sure that it&#x27;s compatible with what the other player might propose. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value, but also leave some for the other player. For example, propose the phone and one mirror. Then, if the other player proposes the other mirror and two fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they propose something else, maybe not. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and both mirrors. That&#x27;s 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. Then the other player would need to take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, they might not accept. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the other mirror and one fruit. That way, all items are used. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good approach.<br/><br/>So, the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 mirror]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 1 mirror and 2 fruits, that&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, like the phone, then it&#x27;s not. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and both mirrors. Then the other player can take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, they might not accept. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the other mirror and one fruit. That way, all items are distributed. So the total value for me would be 4 + 2 = 6, and for the other player, if they value the mirror (2) and fruits (1 each), that&#x27;s 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Total sum 10. If I take the phone and both mirrors, that&#x27;s 8, and the other player takes two fruits (2), total 10. Same total. But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value fruits, then their proposal might not be accepted. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe either approach is possible.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to propose items that are high value for me, but also leave items that the other player might value. However, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. So perhaps the safest is to propose the phone and one mirror, and hope the other player takes the rest. Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors, and the other player takes the fruits. But again, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the phone and one mirror. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the other mirror and two fruits, it&#x27;s compatible. But if they propose something else, like the phone, then it&#x27;s not. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>So, I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal of the phone and one mirror. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, we get a good sum. Otherwise, zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. My values are phone:6, mirror:0, fruit:2. <br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player proposed. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user didn&#x27;t provide the content of the other player&#x27;s proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. How can I respond without knowing what they proposed?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate a proposal based on the given information. But without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s impossible to determine if they are complementary. The key is that if both proposals can be fulfilled with the available items, then both get their scores. Otherwise, zero. So my proposal needs to be such that when combined with theirs, the total items required don&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers as much as possible of the high-value items for me. Since my phone is worth 6, which is the highest, I should definitely try to get the phone. The mirrors are worth 0 to me, so maybe I can give them to the other player if that helps. Fruits are worth 2 each. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to respond to. But without knowing their proposal, I can&#x27;t adjust. Wait, perhaps this is a test where I need to generate a proposal that would maximize the sum regardless of their proposal. But that&#x27;s not possible. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is simulating a scenario where I have to make a proposal after the other player&#x27;s secret proposal. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal isn&#x27;t provided, perhaps this is a mistake. Or maybe in the actual game, the other player&#x27;s proposal is given, but in this case, the user hasn&#x27;t provided it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to make a proposal that would be optimal in general. For example, since I value the phone highly, I should propose taking the phone. The mirrors are worthless to me, so I can offer them to the other player. Fruits are worth 2 each. <br/><br/>But how to structure the proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let&#x27;s say I want the phone and maybe some fruits. But if the other player also wants the phone, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the phone and some fruits. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the phone and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the phone, then we can both get it. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is tricky. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to respond to. But since the user hasn&#x27;t provided it, perhaps this is a setup where I need to make a proposal that would be good in general. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is given in the problem, but I missed it. Let me check again. The user&#x27;s message says: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But there&#x27;s no content of their proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is part of a larger interaction where the other player&#x27;s proposal was given earlier, but in this context, it&#x27;s not here. So perhaps this is a mistake. But given the information I have, I need to proceed. <br/><br/>Assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown, but I need to make a proposal that would maximize the sum. Since the sum is my score plus theirs, I need to ensure that both proposals are complementary. <br/><br/>If I propose items that the other player also wants, but there&#x27;s not enough, then both get zero. So I need to propose items that are either unique or can be split. <br/><br/>Given that, maybe I should propose the phone (since it&#x27;s high value for me) and maybe some fruits. The mirrors are worthless to me, so I can offer them to the other player. <br/><br/>So my proposal could be: [Proposal: 1 phone, 2 fruits]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the phone or the fruits, we can both get them. But if they also want the phone, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and the mirrors. But since mirrors are worth 0 to me, giving them to the other player might be better if they value them. But I don&#x27;t know their values. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem states that each has a secret value function. But I only know my own. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown. So I have to make assumptions. <br/><br/>Since my goal is to maximize the sum, I need to propose items that are valuable to me and possibly items that the other player might also value. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the phone and the fruits, as they are valuable to me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then we can both get them. If they do, then we might have to compromise. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest bet is to propose the phone and the fruits. Let me check the available items: 1 phone, 2 mirrors, 2 fruits. So if I take 1 phone and 2 fruits, that&#x27;s all the fruits. Then the other player would have to take the mirrors. But if their proposal includes the phone, then we can&#x27;t both get it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the phone. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the phone, we can both get it. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is a gamble. However, given that the sum is to be maximized, perhaps the best approach is to propose the phone and the fruits. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 2 fruits]. That uses up the phone and both fruits. The other player would then have to take the mirrors. If their proposal includes the phone or fruits, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if not, then both get their items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one fruit, leaving one fruit for the other player. But that might not be optimal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and the mirrors. But since mirrors are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not helpful. <br/><br/>Hmm. I think the best bet is to propose the phone and the fruits. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 2 fruits]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, we can both get them. If they do, then we might have to give up. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>
