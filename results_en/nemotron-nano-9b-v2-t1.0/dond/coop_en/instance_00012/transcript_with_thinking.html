        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My value function is ruler:1, egg:2, battery:3. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we want to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider that the other player might have different preferences. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should aim for a division that gives both of us as much as possible, assuming they might value items similarly or in a way that complements mine.<br/><br/>First, I need to think about possible proposals. Since each can send up to 5 messages, but we can also make a secret proposal at any time. The key is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s proposal, uses all items without overlap. If that&#x27;s possible, both get their scores; otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize the sum. So I should propose items that I value highly, but also consider that the other player might value some items more. For example, if I take the battery (which I value at 3), maybe the other player values it less, but if they take it, they might get a higher score. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the problem states that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the items in a way that each gets items they value, even if it&#x27;s not the maximum for each individually.<br/><br/>Wait, but without knowing the other&#x27;s values, how can I decide? Maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they would prefer different items. For example, maybe they value eggs more than rulers. But since I don&#x27;t have that info, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all items, but that&#x27;s not possible because the other player would also need to take some. Wait, no, the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose all items, the other player can&#x27;t propose anything, so that would result in zero. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a subset of items that I value, and the other player can propose the rest. For example, if I take the battery (which I value 3), and maybe some eggs or rulers. Then the other player can take the remaining items. But I need to make sure that the total items in both proposals don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities.<br/><br/>Let me list the items:<br/><br/>- Rulers: 3<br/>- Eggs: 2<br/>- Battery: 1<br/><br/>So total items are 3+2+1=6. Each player can take some, but the sum of their proposals must not exceed the available items.<br/><br/>My value function: ruler=1, egg=2, battery=3. So the battery is the most valuable to me. Then eggs, then rulers.<br/><br/>If I take the battery, that&#x27;s 3 points. Then maybe take some eggs. But if I take 2 eggs, that&#x27;s 4 points. But maybe the other player values eggs more. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best is to split the items so that each gets items they value. For example, if I take the battery (3) and maybe some eggs, and the other player takes the remaining eggs and rulers. But I need to make a proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the battery and one egg. That would be 3+2=5 points for me. Then the other player could take the remaining 1 egg and 3 rulers. If their value function is such that they value eggs and rulers, that could be good. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the battery and all 3 rulers. That would be 3+3=6 points. Then the other player would have to take the 2 eggs. If they value eggs, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they would propose something else. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t complement mine, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complemented. For example, if I take the battery and some items, and the other player takes the rest. But how to structure the proposal.<br/><br/>The secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So I need to format my proposal correctly.<br/><br/>Let me think of possible proposals. Let&#x27;s say I propose taking the battery and 2 eggs. That would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 battery, 2 eggs]&quot;. Then the other player would need to take 3 rulers. If their value function is such that they value rulers, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they would propose something else. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the battery and 1 egg, that&#x27;s 3+2=5. Then the other player can take 1 egg and 3 rulers. If they value eggs and rulers, that&#x27;s good. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the battery and 1 ruler. That&#x27;s 3+1=4. Then the other player can take 2 rulers and 2 eggs. If they value those, that&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s challenging. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best approach is to take the items I value the most, and leave the rest for the other player. So taking the battery (3) and maybe some eggs. Let&#x27;s say I take the battery and 2 eggs. That&#x27;s 3+2*2=7? Wait, no. Wait, my value function is ruler:1, egg:2, battery:3. So each item&#x27;s value is per unit. So 1 battery is 3, 2 eggs would be 2*2=4. So total 7. Then the other player would take 3 rulers (3*1=3). Total sum would be 7+3=10. That&#x27;s a good sum.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the battery and 1 egg (3+2=5), and the other player takes 1 egg and 3 rulers (2+3=5). Total sum 10. Same as before.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the battery and 3 rulers (3+3=6), and the other player takes 2 eggs (2*2=4). Total sum 10. Same.<br/><br/>So in all these cases, the total sum is 10. But maybe there&#x27;s a better way. Wait, but the total value of all items is 3*1 (rulers) + 2*2 (eggs) + 1*3 (battery) = 3 +4 +3=10. So the maximum possible sum is 10. So any division that uses all items would give that sum. So the key is to make sure that both proposals are complementary, i.e., they don&#x27;t overlap in items. So if I propose taking some items, and the other player proposes the rest, then the sum is 10. So the goal is to make a proposal that is likely to be complemented by the other player&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complemented. For example, if I take the battery, which is the most valuable to me, and maybe some eggs, and leave the rulers for the other player. But if the other player values rulers, that&#x27;s good. Alternatively, if I take the battery and some rulers, and leave eggs for the other player.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest is to take the battery and some items, and let the other player take the rest. So my proposal could be &quot;[Proposal: 1 battery, 2 eggs]&quot;. Then the other player would need to take 3 rulers. If they do that, the sum is 3 (battery) + 2*2 (eggs) + 3*1 (rulers) = 3+4+3=10. Which is the maximum possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose &quot;[Proposal: 1 battery, 1 egg, 1 ruler]&quot;, that&#x27;s 3+2+1=6. Then the other player would need to take 1 egg and 2 rulers. Their value would be 2 + 2*1=4. Total sum 10. Same.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal could be different. For example, if they propose taking the battery, then my proposal would conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complemented.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the battery and 2 eggs, and the other player would take the 3 rulers. That seems like a good split. So I should make that proposal.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the proposal is in the correct format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets, with the format &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;.<br/><br/>So my proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 battery, 2 eggs]&quot;. That&#x27;s valid. Then the other player would need to propose the remaining items, which are 3 rulers. If they do that, then the sum is 10. If they don&#x27;t, then we get zero. But since the other player&#x27;s goal is also to maximize the sum, they would likely propose the remaining items. So this seems like a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose taking the battery and 1 egg, and the other player takes 1 egg and 3 rulers. That also gives 10. But maybe the other player might prefer to take more eggs. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to tell.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the battery is the most valuable to me, I should take it. Then, for the eggs, maybe take 1 or 2. If I take 2 eggs, that&#x27;s 4 points. If I take 1, that&#x27;s 2. But if the other player takes the remaining eggs, they might get more. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the battery and 1 ruler. That&#x27;s 3+1=4. Then the other player can take 2 rulers and 2 eggs. If they value those, that&#x27;s 2*1 + 2*2=6. Total sum 10. Same as before.<br/><br/>So regardless of how I split, as long as all items are taken, the sum is 10. So the key is to make a proposal that is complementary. Therefore, the best approach is to propose taking the battery and some items, and the other player would take the rest. So I should make a proposal that includes the battery and maybe some eggs or rulers.<br/><br/>But since I can only send a maximum of 5 messages, but the secret proposal is a single message. So I should make the secret proposal now. Let me decide on the best proposal.<br/><br/>If I take the battery and 2 eggs, that&#x27;s 3+4=7. The other player takes 3 rulers (3). Total 10. That&#x27;s good. Alternatively, if I take the battery and 1 egg (3+2=5), and the other player takes 1 egg and 3 rulers (2+3=5). Also 10. Either way, the sum is 10. So either proposal is acceptable.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value eggs more. For example, if they value eggs at 5 each, then taking 2 eggs would be better for them. But since I don&#x27;t know, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, and the total is fixed at 10 if all items are taken, the best is to make a proposal that allows the other player to take the remaining items. So any proposal that takes a subset of items, and the other player takes the rest, would work.<br/><br/>Therefore, I should make a secret proposal. Let me choose to take the battery and 2 eggs. So the proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 battery, 2 eggs]&quot;. That&#x27;s a valid format. Then the other player would need to take 3 rulers. If they do, the sum is 10. If not, zero. But since the other player is also trying to maximize the sum, they would likely propose the remaining items. So this seems like a good move.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So I need to figure out what the other player proposed and then respond in a way that complements their proposal if possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. But in the current setup, I don&#x27;t have any information about what that proposal was. Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to think about possible scenarios. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know it. But maybe the way to approach this is to make a proposal that covers all items, so that regardless of what the other player proposed, if it&#x27;s complementary, we both get the items. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I need to respond to. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes all items, so that if their proposal is also all items, then we can split them. But that might not be possible. Wait, the items are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery. So total items are 3+2+1=6. If both proposals are complementary, meaning that the sum of items in both proposals is exactly the available items. So for example, if I propose to take all items, and the other player also proposes to take all items, then it&#x27;s not complementary because there&#x27;s not enough. But if I propose to take some items and the other player proposes the rest, then it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, maybe the best approach is to make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible, so that if the other player&#x27;s proposal is also comprehensive, we can split. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don&#x27;t have that information, perhaps I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. For example, if I propose to take all the items, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to be empty, which is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a subset that leaves some items for the other player.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets the items they proposed. So if I propose to take, say, 2 rulers and 1 egg, and the other player proposes 1 ruler, 1 egg, and 1 battery, then together they have 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery. That would be complementary. So in that case, both get their items. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best way is to make a proposal that is as balanced as possible. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes all items, but that would require the other player to propose nothing, which is not possible. Wait, no. If I propose all items, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to be nothing to be complementary. But that&#x27;s not likely. So maybe that&#x27;s not a good approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is a subset of the items, leaving some for the other player. For example, if I take 1 ruler, 1 egg, and the battery. Then the other player could take the remaining 2 rulers and 1 egg. That would be complementary. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard to tell.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I need to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don&#x27;t have that info, perhaps I should make a proposal that is a good split. For example, taking 1 ruler, 1 egg, and the battery. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 2 rulers and 1 egg, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is the same as the other player&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s not possible since I don&#x27;t know it. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to respond to that. But since I don&#x27;t have the details, perhaps I need to make a proposal that is a good candidate. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if the other player&#x27;s value function is different. But the problem doesn&#x27;t give me the other player&#x27;s value function. So I can&#x27;t know that. So I have to make a proposal based on my own value function.<br/><br/>My value function is ruler:3, egg:0, battery:1. So I value rulers the most, then battery, then eggs. So I should try to get as many rulers as possible, then the battery, and eggs are not valuable to me.<br/><br/>So maybe I should propose to take all 3 rulers and the battery. That would be [Proposal: 3 rulers, 1 battery]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 eggs, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if their proposal is also 3 rulers and 1 battery, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 2 rulers and the battery. That leaves 1 ruler and 2 eggs. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is 1 ruler and 2 eggs, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, I need to make sure that if possible, both proposals are complementary. So maybe the best approach is to propose a set of items that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, covers all items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, if I propose a set that is a subset of the items, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is the complement, then it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as large as possible, but not overlapping. For example, if I take 3 rulers and 1 battery, then the other player would need to take 2 eggs. If they do, then both get their items. But if they take something else, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. So I&#x27;ll go with 3 rulers and 1 battery. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 2 eggs, then it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal is something else, maybe not. But given my value function, I want to get the rulers and battery. So that&#x27;s my best bet.<br/></p>
