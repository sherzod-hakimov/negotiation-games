    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. My value function is chalk:4, shoe:1, fruit:0. So I really value chalks, shoes are okay, and fruits don&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should assume they have different preferences. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their own items. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we each request don&#x27;t overlap in a way that exceeds the available quantities.<br/><br/>My goal is to propose items that I value highly, but also leave enough for the other player to get some items they value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I want, but also consider that the other player might need certain items. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. However, since the total score is the sum, maybe I should aim for a division where both get as much as possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each is awarded based on their own items. So if I propose some items and the other proposes others, and together they don&#x27;t exceed the available items, then both get their items. Otherwise, zero. So the challenge is to make sure that the combined proposals don&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>So, for example, if I propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe, and the other proposes 1 chalk and 1 shoe, then total chalks would be 3, which is more than 2 available. So that&#x27;s not complementary. So both get zero. But if I propose 1 chalk and 1 shoe, and the other proposes 1 chalk and 1 shoe, then total is 2 chalks and 2 shoes, which is okay. Then both get their items. My score would be 4 (chalk) +1 (shoe) =5, and the other&#x27;s score depends on their values. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also leave some for the other player.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value the most, and hope the other player can get the rest. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that I want, and maybe the other player will propose items they want, and if they are complementary, we both get points.<br/><br/>But since I need to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player might also value some of the remaining items. For example, if I take 2 chalks (which I value 4 each, so 8 total), and the other player takes 2 shoes (if they value shoes more than I do). But I don&#x27;t know their values. Alternatively, maybe the other player values fruits, but since I don&#x27;t care about fruits, maybe they can take them. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe. Then the other player could propose 1 shoe and 2 fruits. That would use 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. That&#x27;s exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. My score would be 4*2 +1*1 =9. The other player&#x27;s score would depend on their values. If they value shoes and fruits, maybe they get a good score. But since I don&#x27;t know, but the total sum would be 9 plus their score. But since I need to maximize the sum, maybe this is a good approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 2 chalks and 2 shoes, that&#x27;s 2*4 + 2*1 =10. But then the other player can&#x27;t get anything, so their score is zero. Total is 10. But if I propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe, and the other proposes 1 shoe and 2 fruits, then total is 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. My score is 9, their score depends on their values. If they value shoes and fruits, maybe they get a good score. But if they don&#x27;t value shoes or fruits, then their score is zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose items that I value highly, and leave some for the other player to take.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 1 chalk and 1 shoe. Then the other player could propose 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That would use 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. My score is 4+1=5, their score would be whatever they value for 1 chalk, 1 shoe, 2 fruits. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. But since the total is 5 plus their score, maybe that&#x27;s better than 10 if their score is high enough.<br/><br/>But since I need to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. For example, if I take 2 chalks (which I value 4 each, so 8), and the other player takes 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes and fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, then their score is zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe. Then the other player can take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. That way, all items are used. My score is 4*2 +1*1=9. Their score would be 1* (their value for shoe) + 2*(their value for fruit). If their value for shoe is, say, 2, and fruit is 3, then their score is 2 + 6=8. Total is 17. But if their values are lower, maybe it&#x27;s worse. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good strategy.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 chalks and 2 shoes. Then the other player can&#x27;t get anything. My score is 10, their score is zero. Total is 10. But if I can get the other player to take some items, maybe the total is higher.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest way is to propose items that I value highly, and hope the other player can take the rest. So I&#x27;ll propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe. That&#x27;s my proposal. Then the other player might propose something else. If they propose 1 shoe and 2 fruits, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose something else, maybe not. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score while allowing the other player to possibly get some items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 chalks and 2 shoes. That&#x27;s 10 points for me. If the other player can&#x27;t get anything, then total is 10. But if they can get some items, maybe the total is higher. But without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 1 chalk and 2 shoes. My score would be 4 + 2*1=6. Then the other player could take 1 chalk, 0 shoes, 2 fruits. If they value chalk, that&#x27;s good. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Hmm. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and leave the rest for the other player. So 2 chalks (which I value 4 each) and maybe 1 shoe. That way, I get 8 +1=9. The other player can take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. If they value shoes and fruits, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe they take nothing. But since I can&#x27;t know, this seems like a reasonable proposal.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 chalk, 1 shoe]. That&#x27;s the format required. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So yes, that&#x27;s correct. I need to make sure not to use square brackets in regular messages, but for the secret proposal, it&#x27;s required.<br/><br/>So I think that&#x27;s the best I can do. Let me go with that.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. My value function is chalk:2, shoe:0, fruit:3. So I value fruits the most, then chalks, and shoes are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to infer what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my proposal needs to complement theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, how can I decide? Hmm. Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is known to me? No, the problem says it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So I can&#x27;t see their proposal. That complicates things. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can deduce based on their possible strategies. Or perhaps I need to make a proposal that is likely to complement theirs.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can respond to. But since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t know. So perhaps the best approach is to make a proposal that covers as much of the high-value items as possible, hoping that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their scores. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But without knowing their proposal, how can I ensure that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they proposed a certain set, but since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t. So perhaps the best strategy is to propose items that are high value for me, and maybe leave some items for the other player. But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me, and also items that the other player might value, but I don&#x27;t know their values.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can guess. For example, if they proposed a lot of fruits, which are high value for me, but maybe they value something else. But without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all the fruits, since they are the most valuable to me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include fruits, then we can both get the fruits. But if they did, then we might conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the fruits. Let me think.<br/><br/>If I propose 2 fruits, then if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include fruits, then we can both get them. But if they did, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a mix. But since I value fruits the most, maybe I should take as many as possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can respond to. But since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t. So perhaps the best I can do is to make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible.<br/><br/>So, given that, I should propose the items that are most valuable to me. So 2 fruits. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include fruits, we both get them. If they do, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 fruits and 2 chalks. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes any of those, then we can&#x27;t. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>But the goal is to maximize the sum. So if I can get the fruits, that&#x27;s 3 each, so 6 total. If I can&#x27;t, then maybe zero. But if I can get some items, that&#x27;s better. So maybe proposing 2 fruits is the best bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed shoes, which I don&#x27;t value, then I can take the fruits and chalks. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would result in zero. Not good.<br/><br/>So, given the uncertainty, the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So 2 fruits. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets. So the message would be &quot;[Proposal: 2 fruit]&quot;.<br/><br/>But wait, the items are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So the other player&#x27;s proposal could be anything. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible. So maybe proposing 2 fruits. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 shoes, then we can both get fruits and shoes. But if they proposed fruits, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance? Not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so the best is to propose the maximum value items. So 2 fruits. That&#x27;s my proposal.<br/></p>
