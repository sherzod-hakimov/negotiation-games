    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 hooks, 2 plates, and 1 bowl. My value function is hook:3, plate:1, bowl:2. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but since we want to maximize the sum, I should consider possible allocations that are complementary.<br/><br/>First, I need to make sure that whatever I propose and the other player proposes, the total items they request don&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available. Since there are 2 hooks, 2 plates, and 1 bowl, any proposal that requires more than that in any category would make the proposals non-complementary, resulting in zero points for both. So the key is to propose items in a way that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly but also leave some items that the other player might value. But since the goal is the sum, perhaps a balanced approach is better. For example, if I take one hook and one plate, and leave the other hook, plate, and bowl for the other player. But I need to structure this into a proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, the proposal format is a list of items with numbers. So I need to specify how many of each item I want. Let me think. If I propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That would leave 1 hook, 1 plate, and 0 bowls. But the other player could then propose taking the remaining items. However, if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the remaining items, then it&#x27;s complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are high value for me but not too many, so that the other player can take the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking 1 hook and 1 bowl. That would leave 1 hook, 2 plates, and 0 bowls. Then the other player could take the remaining hook and plates. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. But since the sum is what matters, maybe the best approach is to split the items as evenly as possible. For example, take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 0 bowls. Then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That way, all items are used. But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 2 hooks, 2 plates, 1 bowl. If I take 1 hook, 1 plate, then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That uses all items. So that&#x27;s complementary. But if I propose that, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to take the remaining items. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe this is a safe bet. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 hook and 1 bowl, leaving 1 hook, 2 plates. Then the other player could take those. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking 2 hooks. But that would leave 0 hooks, 2 plates, 1 bowl. Then the other player could take the plates and bowl. But if they value plates and bowl more, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe not. But since the sum is the goal, maybe taking 2 hooks (which I value at 3 each) would give me 6, and the other player could take 2 plates (1 each) and 1 bowl (2), totaling 4. So total 10. Alternatively, if I take 1 hook (3), 1 plate (1), and 1 bowl (2), total 6. Then the other player takes 1 hook (3), 1 plate (1), total 4. Sum 10. Same total. But maybe there&#x27;s a better split.<br/><br/>Wait, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, that&#x27;s 3+1+2=6. The other player takes 1 hook, 1 plate. 3+1=4. Total 10. Alternatively, if I take 2 hooks (6) and the other player takes 2 plates (2) and 1 bowl (2), total 6+4=10. Same. So maybe either way. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to get a higher total. For example, if I take 1 hook, 2 plates, and 1 bowl. But that would require 2 plates, which are available. But then the other player would have to take 1 hook. But that&#x27;s 3 for me (hook) + 2 (plates) + 2 (bowl) = 7. The other player takes 1 hook (3). Total 10. Still same. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 0 bowls. Then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl. That&#x27;s 3+1+2=6 for them. My total is 3+1=4. Sum 10. Same. So maybe all these splits result in 10. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to get higher. Wait, what if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl (6), and the other player takes 1 hook, 1 plate (4). Total 10. Alternatively, if I take 2 hooks (6) and the other player takes 2 plates (2) and 1 bowl (2). Total 10. So same. So maybe 10 is the maximum possible. But is there a way to get higher?<br/><br/>Wait, the total value of all items is 2*3 (hooks) + 2*1 (plates) + 1*2 (bowl) = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10. So the maximum possible sum is 10. So any allocation that uses all items will give 10. So the key is to make sure that the proposals are complementary. So as long as the proposals don&#x27;t overlap in items, and use all items, the sum is 10. So my goal is to propose a set of items that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, uses all items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to propose something that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose a set that is as likely as possible to be complementary. For example, if I propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl, then the other player can take the remaining 1 hook, 1 plate. That&#x27;s complementary. Alternatively, if I propose 2 hooks, then the other player can take 2 plates and 1 bowl. That&#x27;s also complementary. Either way, the sum is 10. So maybe either proposal is acceptable. But which one is better? Since I don&#x27;t know their values, but the sum is fixed, maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. However, if I can get more for myself, that&#x27;s better. For example, if I take 2 hooks (6) and the other player takes 2 plates (2) and 1 bowl (2), total 10. If I take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl (6), and the other takes 1 hook, 1 plate (4), same total. So either way, the sum is 10. So maybe either proposal is fine. But perhaps I should propose the one that gives me more. So taking 2 hooks would give me 6, which is better than 4. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is to take 2 plates and 1 bowl, that&#x27;s 4. So total 10. Alternatively, if I take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl (6), and the other takes 1 hook, 1 plate (4). Same total. So maybe it&#x27;s better to take 2 hooks. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. If I take 2 hooks, then the other player can take 2 plates and 1 bowl. That&#x27;s possible. So that&#x27;s a valid proposal. So I should propose taking 2 hooks. But wait, the other player might not propose that. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, and the sum is fixed at 10 if all items are used, then any proposal that allows the other player to take the remaining items would be good. So I should propose a set that is likely to be complementary. So maybe propose 2 hooks, 0 plates, 0 bowls. Then the other player can take 2 plates and 1 bowl. That&#x27;s complementary. Alternatively, propose 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl. Then the other player can take 1 hook, 1 plate. Either way, the sum is 10. So which one to choose? Since I don&#x27;t know their values, but the sum is fixed, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the one that gives me more. So 2 hooks (6) is better than 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl (6). Wait, same total. So maybe it&#x27;s the same. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal could be different. For example, if I propose 2 hooks, and the other player proposes 2 plates and 1 bowl, that&#x27;s good. If I propose 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl, and the other player proposes 1 hook, 1 plate, that&#x27;s also good. So either way, the sum is 10. So maybe either proposal is acceptable. But since the user is asking me to make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. Maybe the best is to propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. Because that uses all items, and the other player can take the remaining. Alternatively, maybe propose 2 hooks. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. Since I can&#x27;t know, but the sum is fixed, maybe either is fine. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their value. So the key is to make sure that the proposals are complementary. So I need to propose a set that, when combined with the other&#x27;s proposal, uses all items. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. So maybe the safest is to propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That way, the other player can take the remaining 1 hook and 1 plate. That&#x27;s complementary. Alternatively, if I propose 2 hooks, the other player can take 2 plates and 1 bowl. Also complementary. So both are valid. But which one to choose? Since I don&#x27;t know their values, but the sum is fixed, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the one that gives me more. So 2 hooks (6) is better than 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl (6). Wait, same total. So maybe it&#x27;s the same. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal could be different. For example, if I take 2 hooks, and the other player takes 2 plates and 1 bowl, that&#x27;s 6+4=10. If I take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl, and the other takes 1 hook, 1 plate, that&#x27;s 6+4=10. So same. So either way. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal could be different. For example, if I take 2 hooks, and the other player takes 1 plate and 1 bowl, that&#x27;s 2+2=4, but then there&#x27;s 1 plate left. But that would not be complementary. So the other player&#x27;s proposal must take all remaining items. So if I take 2 hooks, the other player must take 2 plates and 1 bowl. If I take 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl, the other player must take 1 hook and 1 plate. So in both cases, the proposals are complementary. So either is acceptable. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the one that is more likely to be accepted. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. However, since the sum is fixed, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the one that gives me more. So 2 hooks (6) is better than 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl (6). Wait, same. So maybe it&#x27;s a tie. But perhaps the other player&#x27;s value function could make one proposal better. For example, if the other player values plates more, then taking 2 plates would be better for them. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose a balanced proposal. Alternatively, maybe propose taking 1 hook, 1 plate, and 1 bowl. That way, the other player can take the remaining 1 hook and 1 plate. That&#x27;s a good split. So I think that&#x27;s a safe proposal. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hook, 1 plate, 1 bowl]. That should be complementary with the other player&#x27;s proposal of 1 hook and 1 plate. So that&#x27;s the plan.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 2 hooks, 2 plates, 1 bowl. My values are hook:1, plate:0, bowl:8. So I really want the bowl, and the hooks and plates don&#x27;t matter much to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but since I have to make my own proposal, I need to think about what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. But I don&#x27;t know what their proposal was. Hmm, maybe I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary to whatever they proposed. But since I don&#x27;t have that info, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, especially the bowl, and see if they can complement.<br/><br/>Wait, but the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that, when combined with theirs, don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the bowl and maybe some hooks or plates. But since plates are worthless to me, maybe I should just take the bowl. But if I take the bowl, then the other player can&#x27;t take it. But if their proposal includes the bowl, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So maybe I should propose the bowl and see if they can complement with other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that&#x27;s not allowed. Wait, the secret proposal is a way to end the game early. But the user is asking me to submit a proposal. So I need to make a proposal. Let me think. Since I value the bowl highly, I should propose to take the bowl. But if the other player also proposed the bowl, then we can&#x27;t both have it. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I can get it. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the bowl and maybe some other items. But since plates are worthless to me, maybe I should just propose the bowl. Let me check the available items. There&#x27;s 1 bowl. So if I propose the bowl, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the bowl, then we can both have it. But if they did, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the bowl. Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that&#x27;s not possible. Wait, the secret proposal is a way to end the game. But the user is asking me to submit a proposal. So I need to make a proposal. Let me think of the best possible scenario. If I take the bowl, that&#x27;s 8 points for me. The other player&#x27;s proposal might have other items. If their proposal is, say, hooks and plates, then I can take the bowl and they can take the hooks and plates. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should just propose the bowl. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and some hooks. But since hooks are only worth 1 each, maybe it&#x27;s better to just take the bowl. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bowl]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the bowl, we can both get it. If they did, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that&#x27;s not allowed. Wait, the secret proposal is a way to end the game. But the user is asking me to submit a proposal. So I have to make a proposal. So I&#x27;ll go with the bowl.<br/></p>
