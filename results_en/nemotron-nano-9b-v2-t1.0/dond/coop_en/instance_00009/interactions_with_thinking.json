                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. My value function is bolt:6, picture:4, egg:0, card:0. So I really want the bolt and the picture. The other player's values are unknown, but since we want the sum of both scores, I should try to get items that are valuable to me and maybe also consider what the other player might value.\n\nThe available items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. Since I value the bolt and picture highly, I should probably try to get those. The egg and cards are worthless to me, so maybe I can give those to the other player if they value them. But since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. However, the goal is to maximize the sum, so even if the other player doesn't value the items I give them, as long as I get the ones I value, that's good. Wait, but if the other player's proposal and mine are complementary, then both get their items. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap on items. \n\nSo my secret proposal should include the items I want. Let me think. If I propose to take the bolt and the picture, then the other player would need to propose items that don't include those. But since they might also value some items, maybe they would propose the egg and cards. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should just take the bolt and picture, and let them take the rest. But if they also want the bolt or picture, then our proposals would conflict, and we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player can take the remaining items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the bolt, and let the other player take the picture. But if they also want the bolt, that's a problem. But since I don't know their values, maybe the safest way is to take the items I value and leave the rest. But how to structure the proposal. \n\nThe secret proposal format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me check the items again: 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. So if I take the bolt and picture, that's two items. The other player would need to take the egg and cards. But if they also want the bolt or picture, then it's a conflict. But since I can't know, maybe I should just take the bolt and picture. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the bolt and some cards, but since cards are worthless to me, that's not helpful. Wait, but if I take the bolt and some cards, maybe the other player can take the picture and egg. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nBut the key is that the sum of both scores is maximized. So if I get the bolt (6) and the other player gets the picture (4), that's 10. If I get both, that's 10, but if they also get some items, maybe more. But if there's a conflict, both get zero. So the best case is that I get the bolt and picture, and the other player gets the egg and cards. But if they don't value those, their score is zero, but mine is 10. Alternatively, if they value the egg or cards, maybe they can get some points. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to take the items I value and let them take the rest. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bolt, 1 picture]. That way, if they propose items that don't include those, we can both get our items. If they propose something that conflicts, then we both get zero. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, even if they get zero, I still get 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the bolt, and let them take the picture. But if they also want the bolt, then conflict. But if I take the bolt, and they take the picture, that's 6 + 4 = 10. If I take both, same total. But if I take the bolt and they take the picture, that's better because maybe they can take other items. Wait, but the other player's proposal would need to be complementary. So if I take the bolt and picture, and they take the egg and cards, that's complementary. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value function is such that they value the egg or cards. For example, if they value the egg, then they can take it. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes the possible sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the bolt, and let them take the picture. But if they also want the bolt, then conflict. But if I take the bolt, and they take the picture, that's 6 + 4 = 10. If I take both, same total. But if I take both, maybe they can't take anything else, but if they take the egg and cards, that's better. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the other player's proposal is also a secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I can't know their values, maybe the safest is to take the items I value and leave the rest. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bolt, 1 picture]. Then, if the other player's proposal is, say, [Proposal: 1 egg, 4 cards], then it's complementary. If they propose something else, like [Proposal: 1 bolt], then it's conflicting. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe I should just propose the items I want. So I'll go with that. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted with square brackets. So I need to send that. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bolt, 1 picture]. That's the best I can do given my value function. The other player might take the remaining items, but if they don't value them, it's still okay. The sum would be 6 + 4 = 10. If they take some items I don't value, but I get my items, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the bolt, and let them take the picture. But if they also want the bolt, then conflict. But if I take the bolt, and they take the picture, that's 6 + 4. If I take both, same total. But if I take both, maybe they can't take anything else. But since the other player's proposal is secret, I can't be sure. \n\nBut given that the goal is to maximize the sum, and I can't know their values, the best approach is to take the items I value. So I'll make the secret proposal for the bolt and picture.\n"

                    "content": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So first, I need to figure out what the other player's proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don't have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, wait, the user is simulating the scenario where the other player has already made a proposal, and now it's my turn. But in the current context, the user hasn't provided the other player's proposal. That's a problem. Without knowing what the other player proposed, I can't make an informed decision.\n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given information. But the other player's proposal is a secret, so I don't have access to it. That's a key point. Since I can't see the other player's proposal, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can handle the situation where the other player's proposal is unknown. But in a real game, the other player's proposal would be known to me. Since this is a simulation, perhaps I need to assume that the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But without that info, I can't proceed. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal that's optimal given the possible scenarios. For example, if the other player's proposal is unknown, I should propose items that are valuable to me but not too much to the other player. But since I don't know their values, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer. But without any data, that's impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is expecting me to make a proposal that's as good as possible, given that I don't know the other's proposal. But in that case, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but not too high to the other. For example, I value cards at 2 each, so maybe propose some cards. But if the other player also values cards, that could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has a secret value function. So I don't know their values. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. But how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose a balanced set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don't have that info, perhaps the user is expecting me to make a proposal that's optimal in general. \n\nWait, the items available are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. My values are bolt:0, picture:1, egg:1, card:2. So I value cards the most. So maybe I should propose as many cards as possible. But if the other player also wants cards, that could be a conflict. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose a set that's likely to be complementary. For example, if I propose 2 cards, and the other player's proposal is 2 cards, then we can't both get them. But if I propose 2 cards and they propose something else, then it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a mix of items. For example, 1 card, 1 picture, 1 egg. That's 3 items. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to propose a set that's as valuable as possible to me, but not too much that it's likely to conflict. For example, 2 cards and 1 picture. That's 3 items. But again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a secret proposal that's a single item, like a card, to minimize the chance of conflict. But that might not be optimal. \n\nWait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get items that the other player doesn't value, that's good. But since I don't know their values, I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don't have that info, perhaps the user is expecting me to make a proposal that's optimal given the available items. \n\nIn that case, since I value cards the most, I should propose as many cards as possible. But there are 4 cards. If I propose 4 cards, then the other player can't get any. But if they also want cards, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 cards and 1 picture. That's 3 items. But again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose a set that's complementary to what the other player might propose. But without knowing their proposal, it's impossible. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal that's a secret proposal, using the format. So the user is simulating the scenario where the other player has already made a proposal, and now I need to respond. But since I don't have that info, perhaps I need to make a proposal that's optimal in general. \n\nIn that case, I should propose items that are high value to me. So 2 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg. That's 4 items. But the other player might have a proposal that conflicts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 cards and 1 egg. That's 3 items. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose a set that's as valuable as possible. So 2 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg. That's 4 items. \n\nBut the other player might have a proposal that includes some of these. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a secret proposal that's a single item, like a card, to minimize the chance of conflict. But that might not be optimal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don't have that info, I can't. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal that's a secret proposal, and the other player's proposal is not known. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nIn that case, perhaps I should propose items that are not too valuable to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they proposed a bolt, which I value 0, then I can take it. But I don't know. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Since I don't have the other player's proposal, I can't make an informed decision. But in the context of the game, maybe I should make a proposal that's as good as possible. \n\nGiven that, I'll propose 2 cards, 1 picture, and 1 egg. That's 4 items. If the other player's proposal is complementary, then we both get those items. If not, we get zero. But since I want to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the chance that our proposals are complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 cards and 1 picture. That's 3 items. \n\nBut I think the best approach is to propose as many high-value items as possible. So 2 cards, 1 picture, 1 egg. That's 4 items. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 2 card, 1 picture, 1 egg]\n"
