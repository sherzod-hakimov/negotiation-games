    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 ring, 3 fruits, and 1 chalk. My value function is ring:6, fruit:1, chalk:1. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we want to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider that they might value items differently. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should aim for a division that gives both of us as much as possible, assuming they might value items similarly or in a way that complements mine.<br/><br/>First, the total items are 1 ring, 3 fruits, 1 chalk. So total of 5 items. Each of us can take some. The key is that both proposals need to be complementary, meaning that the items they request don&#x27;t overlap. If they do, both get zero. So I need to make sure that whatever I propose, the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take the same items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope they propose items they value highly, but not overlapping. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value less, to leave more high-value items for them, but that depends on their values. Since I don&#x27;t know, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get a high value for myself and they get a high value for theirs, that&#x27;s good. But if we can&#x27;t agree, we both get zero. So the best strategy is to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player proposes items that they value, without overlapping.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me, and maybe they will propose items that are high value for them. But how to coordinate that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set of items that I value, and then in the messages, try to suggest that they take certain items. But the messages are limited to 5 each. So maybe I need to communicate my proposal first, then they respond.<br/><br/>But the problem says that I can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But the secret proposal is a specific format. Let me check the rules again.<br/><br/>Rule (c) says that a secret proposal is formatted as &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So if I make a secret proposal, I have to format it that way. But if I send a regular message, it&#x27;s just text, not in square brackets. So the first step is to decide whether to make a secret proposal or send messages.<br/><br/>But the user is starting the game, so I need to send my first message. Since I can make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should start with that. But I need to think about what to propose.<br/><br/>My value function is ring:6, fruit:1, chalk:1. So the ring is the most valuable. If I take the ring, I get 6 points. If I don&#x27;t, maybe the other player takes it. But if they take it, they might get a higher value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should take the ring. But if I take the ring, then the other player can&#x27;t take it, so they have to take fruits and chalk. But if they value fruits more, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they don&#x27;t take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose taking the ring and some fruits, and leave the chalk for them. Or maybe take the ring and chalk, and leave fruits for them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the ring and some fruits, and in the messages, suggest that they take the remaining fruits and chalk. But how to communicate that.<br/><br/>Wait, the messages are direct, so I can&#x27;t include the secret proposal in the messages. So if I want to make a secret proposal, I have to send it in the specific format. Otherwise, I can send regular messages. But the problem says that the secret proposal is a way to terminate early. So maybe I should make a secret proposal first.<br/><br/>But what should I propose? Let&#x27;s think. If I propose taking the ring and all 3 fruits, that&#x27;s 6 + 3*1 = 9 points for me. Then the other player would have to take the chalk, which is 1 point. Total sum is 10. Alternatively, if I take the ring and chalk, that&#x27;s 6 +1=7, and the other player takes 3 fruits (3 points), total 10. Same total. Or if I take the ring and 1 fruit, 6+1=7, and the other takes 2 fruits and chalk, 2+1=3, total 10. So in all cases, the total is 10. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is different. For example, if they value fruits more, then taking more fruits would be better. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to take the ring and as many fruits as possible, leaving the chalk for them. Or maybe take the ring and chalk, leaving fruits for them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the ring and 1 fruit, and in the messages, suggest that they take the remaining 2 fruits and chalk. But how to do that. Since messages are limited, maybe I can send a message saying &quot;I propose taking the ring and 1 fruit. You can take the rest.&quot; But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I need to be concise.<br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So my first message should be either a secret proposal or a regular message. Since the secret proposal is a way to end early, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think about what to propose.<br/><br/>If I propose [Proposal: 1 ring, 3 fruits], then the other player would have to take the chalk. If they accept, then my score is 6+3=9, theirs is 1, total 10. If they don&#x27;t accept, we both get zero. Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 ring, 1 fruit], then they can take 2 fruits and chalk. Their score would be 2*1 +1=3, total 6+1+3=10. Same total. But if they value fruits more, maybe they would take more. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the ring and chalk, and leave the fruits. Then they can take all 3 fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they don&#x27;t take them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should not make a secret proposal and instead send messages to coordinate. For example, I can say &quot;I want the ring and 2 fruits. You can take the rest.&quot; But the problem is that the other player might not agree. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value and hope they propose items they value.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and in the messages, suggest that they take the remaining items. But how to do that within 5 messages.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I propose taking the ring and 3 fruits, that&#x27;s 9 points for me, and 1 for them. Total 10. If I propose taking the ring and 1 fruit, then they can take 2 fruits and chalk. Their score would be 2+1=3, total 6+1+3=10. Same. If I take the ring and chalk, then they take 3 fruits. Their score is 3, total 6+1+3=10. So in all cases, the total is 10. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value fruits more. For example, if they value fruits at 2 each, then taking 3 fruits would give them 6, and I take ring and chalk (6+1=7), total 13. But since I don&#x27;t know, I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the ring and 1 fruit, and in the messages, suggest that they take the remaining 2 fruits and chalk. But how to do that. Let me think about the message format. The messages are direct, so I can&#x27;t use square brackets. So I can send a message like &quot;I propose taking the ring and 1 fruit. You can take the rest.&quot; But the other player might not agree. But if they do, then the total is 6+1 + (2*1 +1) = 10. If they don&#x27;t, we get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than not proposing anything.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me go with that. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 ring, 3 fruits]. Then the other player would have to take the chalk. If they accept, total is 9+1=10. If they don&#x27;t, zero. But maybe they would accept because they get 1 point. Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 ring, 1 fruit], then they can take 2 fruits and chalk. Their score would be 2+1=3, total 6+1+3=10. Same. So either way, the total is 10. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value fruits more. For example, if they value fruits at 2 each, then taking 3 fruits would be 6, and I take ring and chalk (7), total 13. But since I don&#x27;t know, I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>But since the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, and assuming that the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they also want to maximize their own score, but we don&#x27;t know. However, since the sum is what matters, maybe the best is to propose items that I value, and let the other player take the rest. Because if they take the rest, their value might be higher. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the ring and chalk, and leave the fruits. Then the other player can take all 3 fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe they don&#x27;t. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a decision, I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal. Let me choose to take the ring and 3 fruits. That gives me 9 points, and the other player gets 1. Total 10. Alternatively, if I take the ring and 1 fruit, and they take 2 fruits and chalk, total is 6+1 + 2+1=10. Same. So either way, the total is 10. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value fruits more. For example, if they value fruits at 2 each, then taking 3 fruits would be 6, and I take ring and chalk (7), total 13. But since I don&#x27;t know, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t give me their value function, I have to assume that their value function is unknown. Therefore, the best I can do is to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should not make a secret proposal and instead send messages. For example, I can send a message saying &quot;I want the ring and 2 fruits. You can take the rest.&quot; Then the other player might respond with their proposal. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.<br/><br/>But the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe the best is to make a secret proposal. Let me go with that. So my first message is the secret proposal. Let me format it as [Proposal: 1 ring, 3 fruits]. That way, I get the ring and all fruits, and the other player gets the chalk. If they accept, total is 9+1=10. If not, zero. But maybe they would accept because they get 1 point. Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 ring, 1 fruit], then they can take 2 fruits and chalk. Their score would be 2+1=3, total 6+1+3=10. Same. So either way, the total is 10. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value fruits more. For example, if they value fruits at 2 each, then taking 3 fruits would be 6, and I take ring and chalk (7), total 13. But since I don&#x27;t know, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t give me their value function, I have to make an assumption. Maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is similar to mine, but that&#x27;s not stated. Alternatively, maybe they have different values. But without that info, I can&#x27;t optimize for that.<br/><br/>Therefore, the safest bet is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. So I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal for the ring and 3 fruits. That&#x27;s my first message.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So I need to figure out what the other player proposed and then respond in a way that complements their proposal if possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. But in the current setup, I don&#x27;t have any information about what that proposal was. Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to think about possible scenarios. Since the items are 1 ring, 3 fruits, 1 chalk. The other player&#x27;s proposal could be any combination of these items. But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to make assumptions or find a way to propose something that maximizes the total value.<br/><br/>But the key here is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we both want don&#x27;t overlap), then we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So my goal is to propose items that the other player isn&#x27;t proposing, so that together we can take all items and maximize the total.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that covers as much as possible, but in a way that leaves room for the other player&#x27;s proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also consider that the other player might have similar valuations.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem states that each of us has a secret value function. So the other player&#x27;s value function is unknown to me. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary to theirs. But without knowing their values, how can I do that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to respond to that. But since I don&#x27;t have the details of their proposal, perhaps I need to make a general strategy.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the information given. Let me recheck the problem.<br/><br/>The available items are 1 ring, 3 fruits, 1 chalk. My value function is ring:6, fruit:1, chalk:1. The other player&#x27;s value function is secret. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to submit my own.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. However, without knowing their proposal, this is challenging. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, but also leave some items for the other player. Alternatively, maybe propose all items, but that would conflict with their proposal, leading to zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the ring, I could propose the fruits and chalk. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is speculative.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to propose nothing, but that would result in zero. Or propose a subset that doesn&#x27;t overlap with their proposal. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the problem is designed so that I can make a proposal that is complementary to any possible proposal. For example, if I propose the ring and chalk, and the other player proposed the fruits, then we can both get their items. But if the other player proposed the ring, then my proposal would conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best way is to propose items that are less valuable to me but more valuable to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, this is impossible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to propose in a way that maximizes the total. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that if I propose certain items, the total is maximized. For example, if I propose the ring (which I value 6) and the other player proposed the fruits and chalk (which they might value, say, 3 each), then total would be 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. But if I propose the fruits and chalk, and they proposed the ring, then total is 1+1 +6=8. So maybe proposing the ring is better.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the ring, as it&#x27;s the highest value item for me. But if the other player also values the ring highly, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the ring, and hope that the other player didn&#x27;t propose it. Alternatively, propose the fruits and chalk, which are lower value for me but maybe the other player values them more.<br/><br/>But this is all guesswork. Since the problem is a game, perhaps the optimal strategy is to propose the ring, as it&#x27;s the highest value item for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the ring, then we can both get it. If they did, then we get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the fruits and chalk. If I propose the ring, then we can both get their items. But if they proposed the ring, then we can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have that information, perhaps the best I can do is to make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. So I should propose the ring, since it&#x27;s the highest value for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the ring, then we can both get it. If they did, then we get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the fruits and chalk. If the other player proposed the ring, then we can both get their items. But if they proposed the fruits, then we can&#x27;t. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the optimal is to propose nothing, but that would result in zero. So that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the ring. If I propose the fruits and chalk, then we can both get their items. But if they proposed the fruits, then I can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, perhaps the best approach is to propose the ring. Let me think. If I propose the ring, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the fruits and chalk, then we can both get their items. My value would be 6, theirs would be whatever they value the fruits and chalk. If their value for fruits is, say, 2 each, then total would be 6 + 2*3 + 1 (if they value chalk as 1) = 6+6+1=13. But if their value for fruits is higher, that&#x27;s better. Alternatively, if they proposed the ring, then we can&#x27;t both get it, so zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the ring. Alternatively, maybe propose the fruits and chalk. But which is better?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the ring. If I propose the fruits and chalk, then we can both get their items. But if they proposed the fruits, then I can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since my value for the ring is 6, which is higher than the fruits (1 each) and chalk (1), it&#x27;s better to take the ring if possible. So I should propose the ring. But if the other player also proposed the ring, then we get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t, then we can both get it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the fruits. If I propose the ring and chalk, then we can both get their items. My value would be 6 +1=7, theirs would be 3*1=3 (if they value fruits as 1 each). Total 10. If I had proposed the fruits, then we can&#x27;t both get them, so zero.<br/><br/>So in that case, proposing the ring and chalk would be better. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>But since the problem is structured as a game where I have to make a proposal after the other player&#x27;s secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information, perhaps the answer is to make a proposal that is complementary to any possible proposal. But that&#x27;s not possible. So maybe the best is to propose the ring, as it&#x27;s the highest value for me, and hope that the other player didn&#x27;t propose it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the fruits. If I propose the ring and chalk, then we can both get their items. My value would be 6+1=7, theirs would be 3*1=3. Total 10. If I had proposed the fruits, then we can&#x27;t both get them, so zero. So that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player proposed the chalk, then I can propose the ring and fruits. My value 6+3*1=9, theirs 1. Total 10.<br/><br/>So in any case, proposing the ring and some other items might be better. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since the problem is presented as a scenario where I have to make a proposal now, and the other player has already made a secret one, but I don&#x27;t know what it is, perhaps the answer is to make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and hope that it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the ring. If I propose the fruits and chalk, then we can both get their items. My value would be 1+1=2, theirs would be 6. Total 8. If I had proposed the ring, then we can&#x27;t both get it, so zero. So in that case, proposing the fruits and chalk is better.<br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the fruits, then I can propose the ring and chalk. My value 6+1=7, theirs 3*1=3. Total 10.<br/><br/>So depending on their proposal, different strategies are better. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the ring and the chalk. Because if they proposed the fruits, then we can both get their items. If they proposed the ring, then we can&#x27;t. But if they proposed the chalk, then I can take the ring and fruits.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the fruits. So I should propose the ring and chalk. That way, if they proposed the fruits, we can both get their items. If they proposed the ring, then we can&#x27;t. But if they proposed the chalk, then I can take the ring and fruits.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the ring is the highest value for me, I should prioritize that. So I&#x27;ll propose the ring. But if the other player also proposed the ring, then we get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t, then we can both get it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the fruits and chalk. If the other player proposed the ring, then we can both get their items. My value would be 1+1=2, theirs 6. Total 8. If I had proposed the ring, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So in that case, proposing the fruits and chalk is better.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance. However, since the problem is a cooperative game, maybe the optimal strategy is to propose items that are not overlapping with the other player&#x27;s proposal. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I can&#x27;t do that.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to respond to that. But since I don&#x27;t have the details, perhaps the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given information. Maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not given, but I have to make a proposal now.<br/><br/>In that case, the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. So I should propose the ring, since it&#x27;s the highest value for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the ring, then we can both get it. If they did, then we get zero. But that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the fruits and chalk. If the other player proposed the ring, then we can both get their items. But if they proposed the fruits, then we can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the ring. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 ring]. That way, if the other player didn&#x27;t propose the ring, we can both get it. If they did, then we get zero. But that&#x27;s the risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the fruits and chalk. If the other player proposed the ring, then we can both get their items. But if they proposed the fruits, then we can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the ring is worth 6 to me, which is higher than the fruits (1 each) and chalk (1), it&#x27;s better to take the ring if possible.<br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is to take the ring. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 ring].<br/></p>
