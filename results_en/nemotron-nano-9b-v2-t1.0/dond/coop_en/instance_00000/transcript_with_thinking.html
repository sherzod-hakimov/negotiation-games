    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 rings, 1 dice, and 1 pan. My value function is ring: 0, dice: 4, pan: 6. So I value the pan the most, then the dice, and rings are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since it&#x27;s a cooperative game, I should assume they have their own preferences. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should focus on items that are valuable to me and see if there&#x27;s a way to get them while also getting something they value. But wait, the problem says the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So I need to find a division where both of us get items that are valuable to us, even if we don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s values. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, the key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose to take certain items, the other player&#x27;s proposal must not conflict. For example, if I take the pan, they can&#x27;t also take it. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope they can take items they value. But how to coordinate?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player might propose items they value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps I should propose items that are valuable to me, and maybe they can take the rest. But the problem is that if my proposal and theirs are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I take and the items they take don&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe they can take the rest. For example, if I take the pan (which is worth 6 to me), and they take the dice (which is worth 4 to them, assuming they value it). But I don&#x27;t know if they value the dice. Alternatively, maybe they value the rings. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to find a division where the total value is maximized. But without knowing their values, how can I do that? Maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they can take items that are valuable to them, but I have to make a proposal that allows for that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they would prefer certain items. But since I don&#x27;t have that information, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes items I value, and maybe the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the messages?<br/><br/>The rules say that I can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But what should I propose?<br/><br/>Since I value the pan the most (6), then the dice (4), and rings (0). So I should try to get the pan and maybe the dice. But if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take them. But if I take the pan, and they take the dice, that would be good. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is to take the rings, that would be complementary. But if they also want the pan or dice, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and hope that they can take the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan, and leave the dice and rings for the other player. But if the other player values the dice, that&#x27;s good. If they value the rings, that&#x27;s also good. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. But the goal is to maximize the sum. So maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the messages?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s a one-time thing. So if I propose to take the pan and the dice, then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include those. But if they propose to take the pan, then it&#x27;s conflicting. But if they propose to take the rings, then it&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player can take the rest. For example, I take the pan (6) and the dice (4), total 10. If the other player takes the rings (which I value 0), but if they value them, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, then their score is zero. But the sum would be 10 plus whatever they get. But if they can&#x27;t get anything, then the sum is 10. Alternatively, if I take the pan and the other player takes the dice, that&#x27;s 6 + 4 = 10. But if I take the pan and the other player takes the dice, that&#x27;s good. But how to ensure that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan, and the other player can take the dice and rings. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to take the pan (6) and the dice (4), and the other player takes the rings (which I value 0, but maybe they value them). So the total would be 6 + 4 + (their value for rings). But since I don&#x27;t know their value for rings, but the sum is maximized if they get items they value. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best I can do is to take the pan and dice, and hope the other player can take the rings. But if they don&#x27;t value rings, then their score is zero, but my score is 10. But the sum would be 10. Alternatively, if I take the pan and the other player takes the dice, that&#x27;s 6 + 4 = 10. If I take the pan and the other player takes the dice and rings, that&#x27;s 6 + (their value for dice + rings). But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice, and the other player can take the rings. But if they don&#x27;t value rings, then their score is zero. But the sum would be 10. Alternatively, if I take the pan and the other player takes the dice, that&#x27;s 6 + 4 = 10. If I take the pan and the other player takes the dice and rings, that&#x27;s 6 + (their value for dice + rings). But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s uncertain.<br/><br/>But since the problem is to maximize the sum, maybe the best approach is to take the pan and the dice, and the other player takes the rings. But how to communicate that?<br/><br/>Wait, the messages are transmitted to the other player. So I need to send messages that suggest my proposal. But the secret proposal is a specific format. So maybe I should first send a message indicating my proposal. For example, &quot;I propose to take the pan and the dice.&quot; Then the other player can respond with their proposal. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal immediately. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So if I send that, it&#x27;s a secret proposal. But if I send a regular message, it&#x27;s transmitted to the other player. So maybe I should first send a message to the other player suggesting my proposal, and then make a secret proposal if needed.<br/><br/>But the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal to take the pan and the dice, then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include those. If they propose to take the rings, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose to take the pan or dice, then it&#x27;s not. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe this is a risk. However, if I can get the pan and dice, that&#x27;s 10 points for me, and if the other player can get the rings (which I value 0), but if they value them, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, then their score is zero. But the sum would be 10. Alternatively, if I take the pan and the other player takes the dice, that&#x27;s 6 + 4 = 10. If I take the pan and the other player takes the dice and rings, that&#x27;s 6 + (their value for dice + rings). But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice, and the other player can take the rings. But how to communicate that. Maybe I should send a message like &quot;I want the pan and the dice. You can take the rings.&quot; But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I need to make sure that the other player understands. But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice, and the other player can take the rings. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pan, 1 dice]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is to take the rings, it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose something else, it&#x27;s not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a gamble. But given that I value the pan and dice, this seems like a good move.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice, and the other player can take the rings. That way, if they value the rings, they get something, and I get the pan and dice. If they don&#x27;t value the rings, then they get zero, but I still get 10. But the sum would be 10 plus whatever they get. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best approach.<br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pan, 1 dice]. That&#x27;s my proposal. Then, the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include pan or dice. If they propose to take the rings, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose something else, like the pan, then it&#x27;s not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. So I should make this secret proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan. My value function is ring:3, dice:1, pan:0. So I value rings the most, then dice, then pan which I don&#x27;t care about.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but in the problem statement, the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own proposal. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores are based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items without overlap, and maximizes the total value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that covers as much as possible of the high-value items for me, but also leaves some for the other player if possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, but also leaves some items for the other player. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they proposed something that would conflict with my proposal, then we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is compatible with theirs.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, this is tricky. However, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can guess. For example, if they proposed to take the dice and pan, then I could take the rings. But since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes all the items I value, but that might not be possible. Let me think about the items. There are 3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan. My value function is 3 for rings, 1 for dice, 0 for pan. So I would want as many rings as possible, then the dice, and the pan is irrelevant.<br/><br/>If I propose to take all 3 rings and the dice, that would be [Proposal: 3 rings, 1 dice]. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 3 rings and the pan, then that would conflict. But if their proposal is 1 ring and the dice, then my proposal would be compatible. But since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the dice and the pan, but that&#x27;s not valuable for me. Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, but also leaves some items for the other player. For example, if I take 2 rings and the dice, then the other player could take 1 ring and the pan. That would be complementary. But if they took 3 rings, then my proposal would conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are the rings and the dice. So [Proposal: 3 rings, 1 dice]. If their proposal is compatible, then I get 3*3 + 1*1 = 10, and they get whatever they proposed. If not, we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the dice and the pan, but that&#x27;s not valuable. Or maybe take 2 rings and the pan. But that&#x27;s worse. So the best is to take as many rings as possible and the dice. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 3 rings, 1 dice].<br/></p>
