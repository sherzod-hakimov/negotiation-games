    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide these items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, and 1 sponge. My value function is hook:3, flower:3, card:0, eraser:1, sponge:0. So I really value hooks and flowers, but the others are less important.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don&#x27;t know their preferences, maybe I should focus on items that are valuable to me and see if there&#x27;s a way to split them so that both get something they value. However, since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, maybe I should propose items that I value highly and hope they can take the rest, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them, but again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get less, if the other player gets more, the total could be higher. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and if they can take the rest, that&#x27;s good. But if their values are different, maybe there&#x27;s a better split.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and if they can take the rest, that&#x27;s optimal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not too valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>The key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose some items, the other player&#x27;s proposal should not overlap. So I need to make sure that the items I take and the items they take don&#x27;t overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Let me think about my own value. I value hooks (3 each) and flowers (3). The other items are less. So if I can get both hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s 3+3=6. But there are two hooks. If I take both hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s 3*2 +3=9. But then the other player would have to take the card, eraser, and sponge. If their value for those is low, maybe that&#x27;s okay. But if they value something else, maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take one hook and the flower, leaving one hook for them. But if they value hooks, that could be good. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the eraser. The flower is 3, eraser is 1. Total 4. Then the other player could take the hooks and card and sponge. But if they value hooks, that&#x27;s good. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their items. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s proposal, covers all items without overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or have high value. For example, the flower is unique. If I take the flower, then the other player can&#x27;t take it. But if they value it, that&#x27;s bad. But if I take it, I get 3, and they might take other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the two hooks. That&#x27;s 3*2=6. Then the other player can take the flower, card, eraser, sponge. If they value the flower, that&#x27;s 3, so total 6+3=9. But if they don&#x27;t value the flower, maybe they take other items. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the eraser. Then the other player can take the hooks and card and sponge. If they value hooks, that&#x27;s good. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value, and hope that the other player can take the rest. But if their proposal is not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not too valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, and if the other player can take the rest, that&#x27;s good. So I&#x27;ll propose the two hooks and the flower. That&#x27;s 3+3+3=9. Then the other player would have to take the card, eraser, and sponge. If their value for those is low, then the total would be 9 plus whatever they get. But if they can&#x27;t take those, maybe they propose something else. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the flower. Then the other player can take the hooks, card, eraser, sponge. If they value hooks, that&#x27;s 3*2=6, plus maybe eraser 1. So total 9+6+1=16. But if they don&#x27;t value hooks, maybe they take other items. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the eraser. Then the other player can take the hooks and card and sponge. If they value hooks, that&#x27;s 6, plus maybe card or sponge. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, but the secret proposal is the final one. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose.<br/><br/>If I propose the two hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower]. Then the other player would have to propose items that don&#x27;t overlap. If they propose the card, eraser, and sponge, that&#x27;s complementary. Then I get 3*2 +3=9, and they get whatever they value for card, eraser, sponge. If their value for those is low, maybe the total is 9 + their value. But if they can&#x27;t take those, maybe they propose something else.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose just the flower, then the other player can take the hooks, card, eraser, sponge. If they value hooks, that&#x27;s 6, plus maybe eraser 1. So total 3+6+1=10. But if they don&#x27;t value hooks, maybe they take other items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose the items I value the most. So I&#x27;ll go with the two hooks and the flower. That&#x27;s my secret proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So I need to figure out what the other player proposed and then decide what to offer in return.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t know what it is. Hmm. Since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. But how?<br/><br/>The items available are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge. My value function is hook:0, flower:2, card:1, eraser:4, sponge:3. So I value eraser the most, then sponge, then flower, then card, and hooks are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given. But since I need to maximize the sum, I should try to get items that are valuable to me and also items that the other player might value less. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly and see if they can be split.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But maybe I can make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary. For example, if I propose items that I value, and they might have proposed items that they value. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes items I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, this is challenging.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items to fulfill both, then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap in items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as broad as possible, or maybe focus on items that I value and they might not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and if they have a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict, we can both get points. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a proposal now, I need to think about what to offer. Let&#x27;s think about my value function. I value eraser (4), sponge (3), flower (2), card (1), hooks (0). So I should prioritize eraser, then sponge, then flower, then card.<br/><br/>If I propose to take the eraser and sponge, that&#x27;s 4+3=7 points for me. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes those items, then we can&#x27;t both get them. But if their proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in their proposal. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value and that are unique. For example, the eraser is only one, so if I take it, the other player can&#x27;t. Similarly for sponge, flower, card. Hooks are two, so maybe they can take one or both.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the items I value most. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 eraser, 1 sponge]. That&#x27;s 4+3=7 for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can both get them. But if they did, then we get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose more items. For example, [Proposal: 1 eraser, 1 sponge, 1 flower]. That&#x27;s 4+3+2=9. But again, if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes any of these, it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, I have to make a best guess. Maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something they value. If I can&#x27;t know, perhaps I should propose items that I value and that are not too many, to minimize the chance of conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would give me zero. Not good.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as complementary as possible. For example, if I propose items that I value, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is items they value, which might not overlap. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t have overlapping items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible. Maybe I should propose items that I value and that are not too many. For example, if I propose the eraser and sponge, which are high value for me, and maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s impossible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all items except hooks. But that&#x27;s 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge. But that&#x27;s a lot. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is similar, it might conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the eraser. That&#x27;s 4 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the eraser, then we can both get it. But if they did, then we get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the eraser and the sponge. That&#x27;s 7 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can both get them. But if they did, then we get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>But given that my goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make a proposal that has a high chance of being complementary. Since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, [Proposal: 1 eraser]. That&#x27;s 4 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the eraser, then we can both get it. If they did, then we get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than proposing multiple items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the eraser and the flower. 4+2=6. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the eraser and the card. 4+1=5. But again, same problem.<br/><br/>Hmm. Since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and are unique. The eraser is unique, so if I take it, the other player can&#x27;t. Similarly for sponge, flower, card. So maybe I should propose the eraser and sponge. That&#x27;s 7 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can both get them. If they do, then we get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the eraser, sponge, and flower. 4+3+2=9. But again, same risk.<br/><br/>But since I can only send a maximum of 5 messages, but the secret proposal is one message. So I need to make a single proposal now.<br/><br/>So, given that, I think the best approach is to propose the items I value most, which are eraser and sponge. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 eraser, 1 sponge]. That&#x27;s 7 points for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we both get them. If they do, then we get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>
