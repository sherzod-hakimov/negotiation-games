            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 pot, 3 magnets, and 1 plate. My value function is pot:5, magnet:0, plate:5. So I really value the pot and plate, but magnets don't matter to me. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. Since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should assume they might value different items. But since the goal is to maximize the total, perhaps I should try to get as many high-value items as possible for both of us.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and their scores are based on their own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the combined proposals don't exceed the available items.\n\nMy value function: pot and plate are worth 5 each, magnets 0. So I should aim to get either the pot or the plate, or both. But since there's only one pot and one plate, I can't get both. So maybe I should propose to take one of them. But if I take the pot, then the plate is left for the other player. If I take the plate, the pot is left. But if I take both, that's impossible. So I need to choose between pot and plate.\n\nBut maybe the other player values the magnets. If I take the pot and plate, then the other player can take the magnets. But since magnets are worthless to me, but maybe they are valuable to them. However, since I don't know their values, I have to make an assumption. But the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get the pot and plate, and the other player gets the magnets, that would be good. But if the other player doesn't value magnets, then their score would be zero, but my score would be 10. Alternatively, if I take the pot, and the other player takes the plate, then my score is 5, theirs is 5 (if they value the plate), total 10. Or if I take the plate, same thing.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose to take the pot and plate, and leave the magnets for them. But if they don't value magnets, then their score is zero, but my score is 10. Alternatively, if I take the pot, and they take the plate, that's 5+5=10. Or if I take the plate, same. But if I take both, that's impossible. So the best is to take one of the high-value items and leave the other for the other player. But how to coordinate that?\n\nBut since we can send messages, maybe I can propose to take the pot, and suggest that they take the plate. Or vice versa. But the problem is that the other player's value function is unknown. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best approach is to propose to take the pot and plate, but that's not possible. Wait, no, there's only one pot and one plate. So I can't take both. So I need to choose between pot and plate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose to take the pot, and the other player can take the plate. That way, both get 5 each, total 10. If I take the plate, same. But if I take the pot, and they take the plate, that's good. But if I take the pot, and they don't take the plate, then maybe they take magnets, which might not be valuable. But since I don't know their values, maybe the safest is to propose to take the pot, and suggest that they take the plate. But how to communicate that?\n\nThe rules say that I can send messages, up to 5 each, or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should make a secret proposal. But the problem is that if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know what I'm proposing. Wait, no, the secret proposal is sent to them, but it's secret. Wait, the rules say that messages are transmitted to the other player, except for the secret proposal. Wait, the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but it's secret. So maybe the other player can't see it? Or is it that the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the content is not revealed? Or is it that the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can't see it? The rules are a bit unclear. \n\nWait, the rules say: \"You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\" So making a secret proposal is an action that can be done at any time, and it's a message. But the secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So when I send a secret proposal, it's a message that the other player receives, but it's secret. Wait, no, the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the content is not revealed? Or is it that the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can't see it? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can't see it. But that would make it impossible for them to respond. Alternatively, maybe the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can't see it, so they can't respond. But that would make the secret proposal ineffective. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can see it, but it's called \"secret\" for some reason. That seems contradictory. Maybe the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can't see it. But that would make it impossible for them to respond. So perhaps the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can't see it. But then, how would they know what I'm proposing? That seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the other player can see it, but it's called \"secret\" because it's not part of the regular messages. But that's unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to make a secret proposal. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, I should propose to take the pot and plate. But since there's only one of each, I can't. So I need to choose one. Let's say I propose to take the pot. Then the other player can take the plate. That would give me 5 and them 5, total 10. Alternatively, if I take the plate, same. \n\nBut if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can propose to take the pot. Then the other player might propose to take the plate. But if I don't make a secret proposal, I have to send regular messages. But the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]. But that's not possible because there's only one pot and one plate. So that would require both items, which is not possible. So that would result in both getting zero. So that's bad. \n\nAlternatively, I can propose to take the pot. So [Proposal: 1 pot]. Then the other player can take the plate. That would be good. But if I make that secret proposal, the other player would receive it, but since it's secret, maybe they can't see it. Wait, the rules say that messages are transmitted to the other player, except for the secret proposal. Wait, no, the secret proposal is a message. The rules say: \"You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\" So the secret proposal is a message. But the format is [Proposal: ...]. So when I send a secret proposal, it's a message that the other player receives. But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, except for the secret proposal. Wait, no, the secret proposal is a message. The rules say that messages are transmitted, but the secret proposal is a specific type of message. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the rules. \n\nRule (b): You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time. \n\nRule (c): You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n\nSo the secret proposal is a message that is sent, and it's formatted in square brackets. So when I send a secret proposal, it's a message that the other player receives. But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, except for the secret proposal. Wait, no, the secret proposal is a message. So the secret proposal is a message that is sent, and the other player receives it. But the secret proposal is a message that is sent, but the content is in square brackets. \n\nSo if I make a secret proposal, the other player will see it. But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so the secret proposal is a message. So the other player can see it. \n\nBut the problem says that the secret proposal is a message. So if I send a secret proposal, the other player can see it. So in that case, making a secret proposal is just a way to propose items, and the other player can respond. \n\nBut the goal is to maximize the sum. So if I propose to take the pot, and the other player proposes to take the plate, then both get 5 each, total 10. That's good. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose to take the pot, and they propose to take the pot as well, then it's not complementary, so both get zero. \n\nSo the key is to make a proposal that the other player can accept. Since I don't know their values, but I need to maximize the sum. \n\nAssuming that the other player also values the pot and plate, then the best is to split them. So I should propose to take the pot, and they take the plate. \n\nBut how to communicate that. Since I can send messages, maybe I can send a message saying \"I want the pot. You can take the plate.\" But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I can send that. But the secret proposal is a specific format. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. For example, [Proposal: 1 pot]. Then the other player can respond with their own proposal. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, and the other player can also send 5, but the goal is to maximize the sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal to take the pot. Then the other player can take the plate. \n\nBut if I make a secret proposal, the other player can see it. So they can respond. \n\nBut the problem is that the other player's value function is unknown. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, I should assume that the other player also values the pot and plate. \n\nSo the best strategy is to propose to take the pot, and the other player takes the plate. \n\nTherefore, I should make a secret proposal to take the pot. \n\nBut wait, the secret proposal is a message. So if I send [Proposal: 1 pot], then the other player can see that I want the pot. Then they can propose to take the plate. \n\nAlternatively, if I don't make a secret proposal, I can send messages. For example, \"I want the pot. You can take the plate.\" But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I can send that. \n\nBut the secret proposal is a specific format. So maybe the secret proposal is a way to formally propose items. \n\nBut the problem says that the secret proposal is a message. So if I make a secret proposal, it's a message that the other player receives. \n\nSo the best approach is to make a secret proposal to take the pot. Then the other player can take the plate. \n\nAlternatively, if I make a secret proposal to take the plate, same thing. \n\nBut since I value both pot and plate equally, it doesn't matter which one I take. \n\nBut maybe the other player values the magnets. If I take the pot and plate, and they take the magnets, then my score is 10, theirs is whatever they value the magnets. But since I don't know their values, but the goal is to maximize the sum. If they value magnets, then taking them would be good. If not, then their score is zero. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the safest is to take one of the high-value items and leave the other for them. \n\nSo I should propose to take the pot. \n\nTherefore, my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the plate. \n\nBut since the other player might also want the pot or plate, but I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take both the pot and plate, but that's impossible. So that would result in zero. \n\nSo the best is to propose one of them. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 1 pot]. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to write that. \n\nSo the answer is to send a secret proposal for the pot.\n",

You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 pot, 3 magnets, 1 plate\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\npot: 4, magnet: 2, plate: 0\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n\n\nThe other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.\n"

The items available are 1 pot, 3 magnets, and 1 plate. My value function is pot:4, magnet:2, plate:0. So I value the pot the most, then magnets, and the plate is worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don't overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that, when combined with theirs, don't overlap and use all items. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that covers as much of the high-value items as possible. Since the pot is worth 4 to me, I should definitely try to get that. The magnets are worth 2 each, so getting all three would be good. The plate is worthless, so maybe I can ignore that.\n\nBut since the other player's proposal is secret, I need to make a proposal that, regardless of theirs, maximizes the chance of a successful split. Wait, but if I make a secret proposal, then the other player's proposal is already known? No, the other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. So I have to make my own secret proposal, and then the system will check if both are complementary.\n\nBut how can I maximize the sum? The sum is my value plus theirs. So I need to propose items that I value highly, and also items that the other player might value. But since I don't know their value function, maybe I should assume that they might value the same items. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. For example, if I take the pot and all three magnets, that's 4 + 3*2 = 10. If the other player's proposal doesn't include any of these, then we can both get our items. But if they also want the pot or magnets, then we can't both get them, leading to zero.\n\nBut since the other player's proposal is secret, I can't know. So maybe the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most, and hope that the other player's proposal is compatible. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a subset that leaves some items for the other player. But without knowing their values, it's hard to balance.\n\nWait, the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get the pot and magnets, and the other player gets the plate, that would be good. But the plate is worthless to me, but maybe the other player values it. However, since I don't know their value function, I can't be sure. But since the plate is worthless to me, maybe I should leave it for them. But if I take the pot and magnets, and they take the plate, that's a good split. But if they also want the pot or magnets, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and some magnets, leaving some magnets for them. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the pot and all three magnets. If the other player's proposal is compatible, then we both get our items. If not, we get zero. But if I can get the pot and magnets, that's a high value for me. The other player's value might be different. For example, if they value the plate, but I don't. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to take the high-value items.\n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 3 magnets]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include these, we can both get them. If they do, then we get zero. But since the other player's proposal is secret, I can't know. However, given that the goal is to maximize the sum, this seems like a good bet. The plate is worthless to me, so maybe the other player can take it. But if they also want the pot or magnets, then it's a problem. But without knowing, this is the best I can do.\n",
