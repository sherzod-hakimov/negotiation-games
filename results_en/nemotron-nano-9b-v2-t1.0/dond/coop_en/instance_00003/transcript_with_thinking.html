    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 bags, and 1 onion. My value function is carrot:3, bag:1, onion:3. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but since we want to maximize the sum, I should consider possible scenarios.<br/><br/>First, the key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the items they request must not overlap. So if I take the carrot and onion, the other player can take the bags. Or maybe split the bags between us. But since there are 4 bags, maybe splitting them could be better if the other player values them more.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make assumptions. However, the goal is to maximize the sum. So maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and leave items that the other player might value more. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s values are also given? No, the problem states that each has a secret value function. So I don&#x27;t know theirs. Hmm.<br/><br/>But the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to propose items that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, cover all items, and the sum of both players&#x27; values is maximized. But since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements mine. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to the other player? But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is also given? No, the problem says each has a secret value function. So I don&#x27;t have access to theirs. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary and maximize the total. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and leave the rest for the other player. For example, if I take the carrot and onion (which I value 3 each), and leave the 4 bags. If the other player takes the bags, then the total would be my 3+3=6 plus their value for 4 bags. But if their value for bags is, say, 1 each, then total is 6+4=10. But if I take the bags instead, maybe I get less. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the items I value most.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe split the bags. For example, if I take 2 bags and leave 2 for the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best is to propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the proposal.<br/><br/>The secret proposal format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think. The items are 1 carrot, 4 bags, 1 onion. So possible proposals could be:<br/><br/>- Take carrot and onion (total value 6 for me)<br/>- Take 4 bags (value 4)<br/>- Take carrot and 2 bags (3+2=5)<br/>- Take onion and 2 bags (3+2=5)<br/>- Take nothing (but that&#x27;s bad)<br/><br/>But if I propose carrot and onion, then the other player can take the 4 bags. If their value for bags is, say, 1 each, then total is 6 + 4 = 10. If I take the bags, maybe I get 4, and they take carrot and onion (6), total 10. So same. But if the other player values bags more, then taking the bags would be better. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take the carrot and leave the rest. Then the other player can take onion and bags. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best is to propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the message.<br/><br/>Wait, the user is me, and I need to send a message. The first message is my proposal. The other player will respond with their proposal. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best is to propose all items, but that would not be complementary. Because if both propose all items, they can&#x27;t both get them. So that would result in zero.<br/><br/>So the key is to propose a subset of items that the other player can take the rest. So for example, if I propose carrot and onion, then the other player can take the 4 bags. That&#x27;s complementary. Similarly, if I propose 4 bags, the other can take carrot and onion. Or if I propose carrot and 2 bags, the other can take onion and 2 bags. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since I want to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. So for me, carrot and onion are worth 3 each, bags are 1 each. So taking carrot and onion gives me 6, and the other player can take 4 bags (value 4 if they value 1 each). Total 10. If I take 4 bags (value 4), and the other takes carrot and onion (6), same total. So either way, the total is 10. But if the other player values bags more, say 2 each, then taking the bags would give me 8, and they take 6, total 14. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose the items I value most. So carrot and onion. Alternatively, maybe propose the bags. But since I value bags less, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the high-value items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take the carrot and leave the rest. Then the other player can take onion and bags. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum, and I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s values, perhaps the best is to propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the carrot and onion. That way, if the other player takes the bags, the total is 6 + (their value for 4 bags). If their value for bags is higher, that&#x27;s better. If not, maybe they take something else. But I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take the carrot and 2 bags. Then the other player can take onion and 2 bags. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a proposal, I need to choose. Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose carrot and onion, and the other player proposes bags, then total is 6 + (their value for 4 bags). If their value for bags is 1 each, total 10. If I propose bags, and they take carrot and onion, same total. But if I propose bags, and they take carrot and onion, same. So maybe it&#x27;s a tie. But if I can get more by taking some bags and leaving some for them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take 2 bags and the carrot. Then the other player can take onion and 2 bags. If their value for bags is higher, that&#x27;s better. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the items I value most. So carrot and onion. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 carrot, 1 onion]. Then the other player can take the 4 bags. That seems like a good split. Alternatively, maybe propose 4 bags, but I value them less. So maybe better to take the high-value items.<br/><br/>So I think the best first message is to propose the carrot and onion. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets. So the message would be: [Proposal: 1 carrot, 1 onion]<br/><br/>But wait, the user said that the secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So the numbers are the quantities. So for 1 carrot and 1 onion, it&#x27;s &quot;1 carrot, 1 onion&quot;.<br/><br/>Yes. So that&#x27;s the proposal. Then the other player would respond with their proposal. If their proposal is complementary, then we get the sum. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. So proposing carrot and onion, and leaving the bags for them. That seems reasonable.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 bags, and 1 onion. My value function is carrot:0, bag:1, onion:6. So I value onions a lot, bags a little, and carrots nothing.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items without overlap, and maximizes the total value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that covers items I value highly, and leave the rest for them. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their score. So if I can make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items, then we both get our scores. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t have overlapping items and uses all items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, and leave the rest for them. For example, I value onions the most. So I should propose the onion. Then, if their proposal includes the carrot and bags, that would be good. But if their proposal also includes the onion, then we can&#x27;t both get it, so we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap with theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the onion and some bags. Let me think. My value for onion is 6, which is high. So I should definitely take the onion. Then, for the bags, I value each at 1. There are 4 bags. If I take some bags, maybe 2 or 3, but I need to leave enough for them. But if I take too many, maybe they can&#x27;t take any. Alternatively, maybe I should take the onion and leave the rest for them. But if they take the onion, then we both get zero. So maybe I should take the onion and some bags, but not all.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and all the bags. But if they also propose the onion, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So that&#x27;s risky. But if I take the onion, and they don&#x27;t, then I get 6, and they get whatever they have. But if they also take the onion, then both get zero. So maybe I should take the onion and some bags, but not all. Let me think about the possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. Then, if their proposal includes the carrot and the remaining 2 bags, that would be complementary. But if they also take the onion, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe the best approach is to propose the onion and as many bags as possible without overlapping. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. That way, if they take the carrot and 1 bag, then we have all items. But if they take the onion, then conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should take the onion and 3 bags. Let me check the values. My value for onion is 6, and 3 bags would be 3*1=3. Total 9. If they take the carrot (0) and 1 bag (1), their total is 1. So total sum is 10. That&#x27;s good. But if they also take the onion, then we both get zero. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe this is a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. Then, if they take the carrot and 2 bags, that&#x27;s 4 bags total. But there are 4 bags. So that would work. My value would be 6 + 2*1=8. Their value would be 0 + 2*1=2. Total 10. Same as before. But if they take the onion, then conflict. So maybe the same risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 1 bag. Then, if they take the carrot and 3 bags, that&#x27;s 4 bags. My value is 6+1=7, theirs is 0+3=3. Total 10. Same total. But again, if they take the onion, conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and all 4 bags. Then, if they take the carrot, that&#x27;s complementary. My value is 6+4=10, theirs is 0. Total 10. But if they also take the onion, then conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s good. But if they do, then zero. So this is a higher risk but higher reward if they don&#x27;t take the onion.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the safest way is to propose the onion and some bags, but not all. But how to decide?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. Let me think. If they propose the carrot and 1 bag, then we have all items. My value is 6+3=9, theirs is 0+1=1. Total 10. If they propose the onion, then conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s good. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. Then, if they take the carrot and 2 bags, that&#x27;s 4 bags. My value 6+2=8, theirs 0+2=2. Total 10. If they take the onion, conflict. But again, same as before.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 4 bags. Then, if they take the carrot, that&#x27;s good. But if they take the onion, conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 10, they get 0. Total 10. But if they do take the onion, then zero. So this is a higher risk but same total if they don&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should take the highest possible value for myself, even if there&#x27;s a risk. Because if they don&#x27;t take the onion, then I get 10, which is better than if I take less. But if they do take the onion, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that they might not take the onion. For example, if their value function is different. But I don&#x27;t know their value function. Wait, the problem says that each has a secret value function. But I only know my own. So I can&#x27;t assume anything about theirs.<br/><br/>So, given that, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which is the onion. So I should definitely take the onion. Then, for the bags, since I value them at 1 each, maybe take as many as possible without overlapping. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe take 3 bags. That way, if they take 1 bag and the carrot, it&#x27;s complementary. If they take the onion, then conflict. But I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 4 bags. But that&#x27;s all the bags. If they take the carrot, then it&#x27;s good. But if they take any of the bags or the onion, conflict. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. That&#x27;s a balance. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If their proposal is, say, the carrot and 1 bag, then my proposal (onion and 3 bags) would be complementary. So total value 6+3 + 0+1 = 10. If their proposal is the onion, then conflict. But if their proposal is something else, like the carrot and 2 bags, then my proposal would have 3 bags, which would overlap. So that&#x27;s a problem. Wait, no. If I propose onion and 3 bags, and they propose carrot and 2 bags, then the total items would be onion (1), bags (3+2=5), but there are only 4 bags. So that&#x27;s overlapping. So that would not be complementary. So in that case, both get zero. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>So maybe I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap with theirs. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe the best way is to propose the onion and 2 bags. Then, if they propose the carrot and 2 bags, that&#x27;s 4 bags. So that&#x27;s complementary. My value 6+2=8, theirs 0+2=2. Total 10. If they propose the onion, then conflict. But if they propose something else, like the carrot and 1 bag, then my 3 bags would overlap. Wait, no. If I propose 2 bags, and they propose 1 bag, then total bags would be 3, which is less than 4. So that&#x27;s not complementary. So that&#x27;s a problem. So maybe I need to propose all the bags I can, but not all.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 1 bag. Then, if they take the carrot and 3 bags, that&#x27;s 4 bags. My value 6+1=7, theirs 0+3=3. Total 10. If they take the onion, conflict. But again, same as before.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 4 bags. Then, if they take the carrot, that&#x27;s good. But if they take any bags or the onion, conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 10, they get 0. Total 10. But if they do take the onion, then zero. So this is a high risk, high reward.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the onion and as many bags as possible, but not all. But how to decide?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. That way, if they take 1 bag and the carrot, it&#x27;s complementary. If they take 2 bags and the carrot, then my 3 bags would overlap. So that&#x27;s a problem. So maybe 2 bags is better. Because if they take 2 bags and the carrot, then my 2 bags and their 2 bags would be 4, which is all. So that&#x27;s good. So my value 6+2=8, theirs 0+2=2. Total 10. If they take 1 bag and the carrot, then my 2 bags and their 1 bag would be 3, leaving 1 bag. So not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad. So maybe 2 bags is a better balance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. That way, if they take 2 bags and the carrot, it&#x27;s complementary. If they take 1 bag and the carrot, then my 2 bags and their 1 bag would be 3, leaving 1 bag. So not complementary. So that&#x27;s a problem. So maybe 3 bags is better. Because if they take 1 bag and the carrot, then my 3 bags and their 1 bag would be 4, which is all. So that&#x27;s good. So my value 6+3=9, theirs 0+1=1. Total 10. If they take 2 bags and the carrot, then my 3 bags and their 2 bags would be 5, which is more than 4. So overlapping. So that&#x27;s bad. So in that case, conflict. So the risk is if they take 2 bags. But if they take 1 bag, then it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose the onion and 3 bags. Because if they take 1 bag, it&#x27;s good. If they take 2 bags, then conflict. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that they might not take 2 bags. But I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 4 bags. Then, if they take the carrot, it&#x27;s good. If they take any bags or the onion, conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 10. But if they do, then zero. So this is a high risk, but high reward.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should take the highest possible value for myself, even if there&#x27;s a risk. Because if they don&#x27;t take the onion, then I get 10. If they do, then zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that they might not take the onion. For example, if their value function is different. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. That way, if they take 2 bags and the carrot, it&#x27;s good. If they take 1 bag and the carrot, then my 2 bags and their 1 bag would be 3, leaving 1 bag. So not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad. But if they take 3 bags and the carrot, then my 2 bags and their 3 bags would be 5, which is more than 4. So conflict. So that&#x27;s bad. So maybe 2 bags is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 1 bag. Then, if they take 3 bags and the carrot, that&#x27;s 4 bags. My value 6+1=7, theirs 0+3=3. Total 10. If they take 2 bags and the carrot, then my 1 bag and their 2 bags would be 3, leaving 1 bag. So not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad. So again, same issue.<br/><br/>Hmm. It seems like no matter what I propose, there&#x27;s a risk of conflict. But maybe the best approach is to propose the onion and as many bags as possible, but not all. Let me think about the possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose the onion and 3 bags, then:<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 1 bag: complementary. Total 10.<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 2 bags: conflict (3+2=5 bags, but only 4 available). So zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 3 bags: conflict (3+3=6 bags, but only 4). Zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 4 bags: conflict (3+4=7). Zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes the onion: conflict. Zero.<br/><br/>So the only way to get a positive score is if they take 1 bag and the carrot. Which is possible. But if they take more than 1 bag, then conflict. So the probability depends on their proposal. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the onion and 2 bags:<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 2 bags: complementary. Total 10.<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 1 bag: my 2 bags and their 1 bag = 3, leaving 1. Not complementary. Zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot and 3 bags: conflict (2+3=5). Zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes onion: conflict. Zero.<br/><br/>So again, only if they take 2 bags and the carrot, it&#x27;s good. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>So the risk is higher here. Because if they take 1 or 3 bags, it&#x27;s bad. But if they take 2, it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the onion and 4 bags:<br/><br/>- If their proposal is carrot: complementary. Total 10.<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes any bags or onion: conflict. Zero.<br/><br/>So this is a high risk, high reward. If they take the carrot, I get 10. If they take anything else, zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe this is the best way to maximize my own value, even if it&#x27;s risky. Because if they don&#x27;t take the onion, I get 10. If they do, then zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that they might not take the onion. For example, if their value function is different. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. Because if they take 1 bag, it&#x27;s good. If they take 2, conflict. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is more likely to take 1 bag. But again, I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. Because if they take 2 bags, it&#x27;s good. If they take 1 or 3, it&#x27;s bad. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 1 bag. Then, if they take 3 bags, it&#x27;s good. If they take 2 or 4, it&#x27;s bad. But again, same problem.<br/><br/>So, given that, maybe the best approach is to propose the onion and 3 bags. Because if they take 1 bag, it&#x27;s good. If they take 2, conflict. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is more likely to take 1 bag. But I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 4 bags. Because if they take the carrot, I get 10. If they take anything else, zero. But this is a high risk.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should take the highest possible value for myself, even if it&#x27;s risky.

But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Hmm. This is tricky. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of being complementary. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. Maybe the best way is to propose the onion and as many bags as possible, but not all. Let&#x27;s say 3 bags. That way, if they take 1 bag, it&#x27;s good. If they take 2, conflict. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags.
