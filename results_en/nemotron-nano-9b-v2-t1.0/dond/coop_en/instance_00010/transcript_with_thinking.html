You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>2 pliers, 1 chalk, 1 nail, 1 bucket<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>plier: 2, chalk: 3, nail: 2, bucket: 1<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide these items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items are 2 pliers, 1 chalk, 1 nail, 1 bucket. My values are plier:2, chalk:3, nail:2, bucket:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but since we want to maximize the sum, I should aim for a division where both of us get items that are valuable to us and maybe also to them. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe also have some value to them. Wait, but how can I know? Maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me, but also try to leave some items that might be valuable to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and the score is the sum of their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items I propose and the items the other player proposes don&#x27;t overlap. Since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflicting. But since there are multiple pliers, maybe that&#x27;s a point of contention.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 2 pliers, 1 chalk, 1 nail, 1 bucket. So if I take both pliers, then the other player can&#x27;t take any pliers. But if I take one plier, maybe they can take the other. But since I don&#x27;t know their value for pliers, maybe I should take both? Or maybe split them? But if I take both, then they can&#x27;t take any. But if I take one, maybe they can take the other. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me. My highest value is chalk (3), then pliers (2 each), then nail (2), then bucket (1). So maybe I should propose chalk and maybe a plier. But if I propose chalk, then the other player can&#x27;t take it. But if I don&#x27;t propose chalk, maybe they can. But since I want to maximize the total, maybe I should take chalk because it&#x27;s the highest value for me. But if the other player also values chalk highly, then maybe we can&#x27;t both get it. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should take it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be contested. For example, the bucket is only 1, so if I take it, they can&#x27;t. But if I don&#x27;t take it, maybe they can. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get a high value item, if the other player can&#x27;t get anything, the total might be lower. So maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but also leave some items that the other player can take. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, this is difficult. <br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is also a secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But if I propose items that are unique, like chalk, then if they also propose chalk, we both get zero. So maybe I should avoid proposing items that are unique. But chalk is unique. So maybe I should not propose chalk? But that&#x27;s a high value for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not unique. For example, the pliers. There are two pliers. If I take one, they can take the other. But if I take both, they can&#x27;t. But if I take both, then they can&#x27;t take any pliers. But if I take one, maybe they take the other. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. For example, if I take chalk (3) and a plier (2), that&#x27;s 5 for me. If the other player takes the remaining plier (2), nail (2), and bucket (1), that&#x27;s 5 for them. Total 10. But if they take chalk instead, then we both get zero. So maybe I should propose chalk and a plier. <br/><br/>But how to structure the message. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. But the user is asking me to make the secret proposal. So I need to decide what to propose. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have high value in general. For example, chalk is 3, which is the highest. So maybe I should take chalk. Then, for the other items, maybe take a plier. <br/><br/>But if I take chalk, then the other player can&#x27;t take it. If they also want chalk, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 3. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not as high value but more likely to be accepted. For example, take a plier and a nail. But that&#x27;s 2+2=4. If the other player takes chalk and bucket, that&#x27;s 3+1=4. Total 8. But if I take chalk and a plier, that&#x27;s 5, and they take the other plier, nail, bucket (2+2+1=5), total 10. That&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>But again, the problem is that if the other player also proposes chalk, then we both get zero. So maybe I should not propose chalk. But then I might miss out on a high value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not unique. For example, take one plier. Then the other player can take the other plier. But if I take one plier, and they take the other, then I get 2, they get 2. Then maybe I can take chalk and nail. But that&#x27;s 3+2=5. But if I take chalk, they can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps I should propose items that are high value to me and also have high value in general. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not overlapping. For example, I take chalk and bucket, and they take pliers and nail. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum. So even if I get a high value item, if the other player can&#x27;t get anything, the total might be lower. So maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also leave items that the other player can take. <br/><br/>For example, if I take chalk (3) and a plier (2), that&#x27;s 5. Then the other player can take the remaining plier (2), nail (2), and bucket (1), totaling 5. So total 10. That&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants chalk, then we both get zero. So maybe I should not propose chalk. But then I might get less. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not as high value but more likely to be accepted. For example, take a plier and a nail. That&#x27;s 2+2=4. Then the other player can take chalk (3) and bucket (1), totaling 4. Total 8. <br/><br/>But if I take chalk and a plier, and they take the other plier, nail, and bucket, that&#x27;s 5+5=10. That&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>But the risk is that if they also propose chalk, then we both get zero. So maybe I should take a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not as high value but more likely to be accepted. For example, take a plier and a bucket. That&#x27;s 2+1=3. Then the other player can take chalk (3) and nail (2), totaling 5. Total 8. <br/><br/>But again, if they also want the plier, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Hmm. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest way is to propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s impossible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique. For example, chalk is unique. If I take it, then they can&#x27;t. But if they also take it, we both get zero. So maybe I should not take chalk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not unique. For example, take one plier. Then the other player can take the other. <br/><br/>But then, if I take one plier (2), and they take the other (2), that&#x27;s 4. Then I can take chalk (3) and nail (2), totaling 5. But if I take chalk, they can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose chalk and a plier, and they propose the other plier and nail and bucket, then we both get our items. <br/><br/>But how to structure the message. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. <br/><br/>So maybe my proposal is [Proposal: 3 chalk, 2 plier]. That would be 3+2=5. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include chalk or that plier. <br/><br/>But if they propose, say, 2 plier, 2 nail, 1 bucket, then that&#x27;s 2+2+1=5. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they propose chalk, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have high value in general. <br/><br/>So, chalk is 3, which is the highest. So I should take that. Then, maybe take a plier. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 3 chalk, 2 plier]. <br/><br/>But if the other player also proposes chalk, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not as high value but more likely to be accepted. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to take the highest possible value items that can be mutually agreed. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. For example, if I take chalk (3) and a plier (2), and the other player takes the other plier (2), nail (2), and bucket (1), that&#x27;s 5+5=10. <br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t take those, maybe they take something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have some value to the other player. <br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not overlapping. For example, I take chalk and bucket, and they take pliers and nail. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and also have high value in general. <br/><br/>So, chalk (3), pliers (2 each), nail (2), bucket (1). <br/><br/>If I take chalk and a plier, that&#x27;s 5. If they take the other plier, nail, and bucket, that&#x27;s 2+2+1=5. Total 10. <br/><br/>That seems good. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 chalk, 2 plier]. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include chalk or that plier. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not as high value but more likely to be accepted. <br/><br/>But I think the best approach is to take the highest value items that I can, and hope that the other player doesn&#x27;t also take them. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with proposing chalk and a plier. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 chalk, 2 plier].<br/></p>
