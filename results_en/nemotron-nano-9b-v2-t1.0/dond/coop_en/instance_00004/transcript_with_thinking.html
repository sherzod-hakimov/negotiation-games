        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 thimble, 1 soap, and 4 stamps. My value function is thimble:3, soap:7, stamp:0. So I really want the soap and thimble, but stamps don&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should assume they have different preferences. But how?<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the items they request must not overlap. So if I take the soap and thimble, the other player can&#x27;t take those. But if I take stamps, maybe they can take the soap and thimble. Wait, but stamps are 4, so maybe they can take some stamps if they value them.<br/><br/>But since my stamps are worthless, I should probably give them all the stamps. But if I do that, maybe the other player can take the soap and thimble. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the soap and thimble, and the other player can take the stamps. But if they don&#x27;t value stamps, then their score would be zero. But if they do value stamps, then that&#x27;s better. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an assumption.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So I need to find a division where the total value (my value plus theirs) is as high as possible. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should try to get the items I value and give them the rest. But if they value the stamps, then giving them stamps would help. But if they don&#x27;t, then maybe they can take other items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have their value function, maybe I should propose taking the soap and thimble, and let them take the stamps. That way, if they value stamps, they get something, and I get the high-value items. If they don&#x27;t, then they get nothing, but I still get the high-value items. That might be the best approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the soap and some stamps, but since stamps are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not helpful. So the best is to take the soap and thimble. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that.<br/><br/>But the other player might have different preferences. For example, if they value stamps highly, then giving them stamps would be good. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes the possible total. So if I take the soap and thimble, and they take the stamps, then my score is 3+7=10, and theirs is whatever they value the stamps. If they value stamps at, say, 5 each, then 4*5=20, total 30. If they don&#x27;t value stamps, then their score is 0, total 10. But if I give them the soap and thimble, then I get nothing, and they get 3+7=10, but that&#x27;s worse for me. So the best is to take the soap and thimble, and give them the stamps. That way, even if they don&#x27;t value stamps, I still get the maximum possible for myself, and if they do, the total is higher.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 thimble]. That way, I get the items I value, and the other player can take the stamps. If they accept, then the total is my 10 plus their value of stamps. If they don&#x27;t, then I still get 10. But if I don&#x27;t take the soap and thimble, maybe I can get something else. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, this seems like the safest bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the soap and some stamps, but since stamps are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not better. So the best is to take the soap and thimble. Let me make sure that the proposal is correctly formatted. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So for example, [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 thimble]. That should be correct.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 1 thimble, 1 soap, and 4 stamps. My value function is thimble:2, soap:0, stamp:2. So I value thimbles and stamps equally, and soap doesn&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my proposal needs to complement theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, how can I decide? Hmm. Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is known to me? No, the problem says that the other player submitted a secret proposal. So I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But I need to make my own proposal. How can I ensure that my proposal and theirs are complementary?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer based on their possible values. But since I don&#x27;t have their value function, I can&#x27;t know. So perhaps the best approach is to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, but that might not be possible if the other player also wants them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so I need to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of being complementary. Since I value thimbles and stamps, maybe I should propose those. But if the other player also proposed those, then we can&#x27;t both get them. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose as much as possible of what I value, and leave some items for them. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own proposal. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get our scores. Otherwise, zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should propose items that are not in high demand. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so the best I can do is to propose items that I value, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if I propose the thimble and some stamps, and they proposed the soap and some stamps, then maybe we can split the stamps. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is as broad as possible, but that might not be possible. Wait, the items are 1 thimble, 1 soap, 4 stamps. So if I propose the thimble and some stamps, and they proposed the soap and some stamps, then we can split the stamps. But if they proposed the thimble, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So maybe I should propose the thimble and as many stamps as possible, but that might not be optimal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap, since I don&#x27;t value it, but that might not help. Wait, my value for soap is 0, so getting it doesn&#x27;t matter. But if I propose the soap, maybe the other player would take it, but since I don&#x27;t care, maybe that&#x27;s a way to avoid conflict. But I don&#x27;t know their proposal.<br/><br/>This is a bit of a dilemma. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes the chance that it&#x27;s complementary. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and leave some items for them. For example, if I propose the thimble and 2 stamps, then if they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, we can split the stamps. But if they proposed the thimble, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the thimble and some stamps, and hope that they didn&#x27;t propose the thimble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stamps. Since there are 4 stamps, and I value them. If I propose 4 stamps, then if they proposed something else, we can both get stamps. But if they also proposed stamps, then we can&#x27;t. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to make a proposal that is complementary to theirs. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, perhaps I should make a proposal that is as general as possible. For example, propose all the items I value, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe propose a subset that is likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so the best I can do is to propose my own items, and if they are compatible, we get points. Otherwise, zero. So I need to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be compatible with theirs.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, this is challenging. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if I propose the thimble and 2 stamps, and they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, then we can split the stamps. But if they proposed the thimble, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the thimble and some stamps, and the soap. Wait, but I don&#x27;t value the soap. So maybe I should propose the thimble and stamps, and leave the soap for them. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap, since I don&#x27;t value it, but that might not help. Or maybe propose nothing, but that would result in zero points. That&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if we can get both proposals to be complementary, that&#x27;s best. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should propose items that are not in high demand. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they are also trying to maximize their own score, they might propose items they value. But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I can&#x27;t assume that. So this is a problem.<br/><br/>In this case, maybe the best I can do is to propose my most valuable items, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. So I&#x27;ll propose the thimble and some stamps. Let&#x27;s say I propose the thimble and 2 stamps. That way, if they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe propose the thimble and 1 stamp, leaving more stamps for them. But again, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap, since I don&#x27;t value it, but that might not help. Or maybe propose nothing, but that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their score. So if I can make a proposal that is complementary to theirs, even if I don&#x27;t know theirs, that&#x27;s the way to go. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so the best I can do is to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complementary. For example, if I propose the thimble and 2 stamps, and they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, then we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the thimble and 2 stamps, and hope that they didn&#x27;t propose the thimble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stamps. Since there are 4, and I value them. If I propose 4 stamps, then if they proposed something else, we can both get stamps. But if they also proposed stamps, then we can&#x27;t. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and the soap. But since I don&#x27;t value the soap, that might not be good. But if the other player values the soap, then maybe they would take it. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>This is really tricky. Since I don&#x27;t have information about their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of being complementary. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and leave some items for them. For example, propose the thimble and 2 stamps. That way, if they proposed the soap and 2 stamps, we can split. If they proposed the thimble, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and 1 stamp, leaving 3 stamps for them. But again, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and some stamps. But since I don&#x27;t value the soap, that might not be good. Unless the other player values it, but I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe the safest bet is to propose the thimble and some stamps. Let&#x27;s go with that.
