        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My secret value function is crayon: 0, chalk: 0, bolt: 5. So I only care about bolts. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should focus on the items I value, which are bolts. There are 2 bolts. If I can get both bolts, that would give me 10 points. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine. <br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that don&#x27;t overlap with what the other player might propose. <br/><br/>Since I value bolts, I should propose taking both bolts. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t also take bolts. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe they might also want bolts. But if I take both, then even if they take something else, it&#x27;s okay. Wait, but if I take both bolts, and they take something else, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also take bolts, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best strategy is to propose taking both bolts. That way, if they don&#x27;t take any bolts, then my proposal is valid. If they do take bolts, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose taking both bolts. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one bolt and something else. But since I don&#x27;t value crayons or chalk, that might not be good. Wait, but if I take one bolt and something else, maybe the other player can take the other bolt. But that would split the bolts, which might be worse for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both bolts. Let me think. If I propose [Proposal: 2 bolts], then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include any bolts. If they propose something else, then it&#x27;s okay. If they also propose bolts, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to take both. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player also values bolts. If they do, then they might propose taking both. But if I take both, then their proposal would conflict. However, if I take both, and they take something else, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one bolt. Then, if the other player takes the other bolt, that&#x27;s okay. But if they take both, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But since my value for bolts is 5 each, getting both would give me 10. If I take one, I get 5. So it&#x27;s better to take both. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take any bolts. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose taking both. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might also want bolts. If they do, then their proposal would conflict. But if I take both, then even if they take something else, it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both bolts. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. <br/><br/>So my first message should be the secret proposal. Let me format it correctly. The items are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, 2 bolts. So if I propose taking 2 bolts, the message would be [Proposal: 2 bolts]. <br/><br/>But maybe I should also include other items? But since I don&#x27;t value them, it&#x27;s better to just take the bolts. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 bolts and 1 chalk. But since I don&#x27;t value chalk, that&#x27;s not helpful. <br/><br/>So the best is to propose taking both bolts. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t take any bolts, I get 10. If they do take some, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 bolt. But that would give me 5, which is less than 10. <br/><br/>So I think the optimal is to propose taking both bolts. Let me make sure that the format is correct. The secret proposal should be in square brackets, with the items listed. So [Proposal: 2 bolts]. <br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s the correct format. So I should send that as my secret proposal.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My values are crayon:1, chalk:3, bolt:2.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that info, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose something, the other&#x27;s proposal must not overlap in a way that the total items requested exceed what&#x27;s available. For example, if I ask for 2 crayons and 1 chalk, and the other asked for 1 crayon and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s okay because total crayons would be 3 (2+1), chalk 1, bolts 1. But if both ask for 2 crayons each, that&#x27;s 4, which is more than available, so both get zero.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me but maybe not too high for them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less likely to conflict. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to respond to that. But since I don&#x27;t have the details of their proposal, perhaps I need to make a general approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I can counter. For example, if they proposed something that&#x27;s high value for them but low for me, I might want to take those items. Or if they proposed items I value highly, I might need to adjust.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have that info, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me. My highest value is chalk (3), then bolts (2), then crayons (1). So maybe I should propose chalk and bolts. But I need to make sure that the other&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose a combination that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. For example, if I propose 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s 3+2=5 points for me. If the other&#x27;s proposal is something that doesn&#x27;t take those, then it&#x27;s good. But if they also want chalk or bolts, then it might conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 crayons and 1 chalk. That&#x27;s 2*1 +3=5. But if the other also wants chalk, that&#x27;s a problem. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose items that are less likely to be in high demand.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s 3+4=7 points. But again, depends on the other&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to make a proposal that complements theirs. But without knowing their proposal, I can&#x27;t. So perhaps the best approach is to make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, assuming that the other&#x27;s proposal is not conflicting.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed 3 crayons, I might want to take some crayons. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best strategy is to propose items that are high value for me and not too high for the other. For example, if I propose 1 chalk (which is high for me) and 1 bolt (also high), but maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 crayons and 1 chalk. That&#x27;s 2+3=5. If the other&#x27;s proposal is, say, 1 crayon and 1 bolt, then total crayons would be 3 (2+1), chalk 1, bolts 1. That works. So that&#x27;s a possible proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s 3+4=7. If the other&#x27;s proposal is, say, 1 crayon and 1 chalk, then chalk would be 2, which is more than available. So that would conflict. But if their proposal is 1 crayon and 1 bolt, then it&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose items that are high value for me and not too many. For example, 1 chalk and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s 3+2=5. If the other&#x27;s proposal is something else, maybe it&#x27;s compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 crayons and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s 2+2=4. But again, depends.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s 3+4=7. That&#x27;s better. But if the other also wants chalk or bolts, it might conflict.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a proposal, I need to choose. Given that I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, maybe the best is to propose items that are high value for me and not too many. So 1 chalk and 1 bolt. Or 1 chalk and 2 bolts. Let me check the values.<br/><br/>If I propose 1 chalk and 2 bolts, that&#x27;s 3+4=7. If the other&#x27;s proposal is, say, 1 crayon and 1 chalk, then chalk would be 2, which is more than available. So that&#x27;s a conflict. But if their proposal is 1 crayon and 1 bolt, then it&#x27;s okay. So it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s 3+2=5. If the other&#x27;s proposal is 1 crayon and 1 chalk, then chalk is 2, which is over. But if their proposal is 1 crayon and 1 bolt, then it&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 crayons and 1 chalk. That&#x27;s 2+3=5. If the other&#x27;s proposal is 1 crayon and 1 bolt, then total crayons 3, chalk 1, bolts 1. That works. So that&#x27;s a possible proposal.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s hard. However, since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, assuming that the other&#x27;s proposal is not conflicting. So maybe propose 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s 7 points. If the other&#x27;s proposal is something that doesn&#x27;t take those, then I get 7. If it does, then maybe I get less or zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s 5. But maybe that&#x27;s safer.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 3 crayons. That&#x27;s 3 points. But that&#x27;s lower.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 chalk and 1 crayon. That&#x27;s 3+1=4. But again, depends.<br/><br/>But since I need to make a proposal, I think the best is to go for the highest value items. So 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s 7. Let me check if that&#x27;s possible. The available items are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, 2 bolts. So if I take 1 chalk and 2 bolts, that&#x27;s all the chalk and all the bolts. Then the other player can&#x27;t take any of those. So if their proposal includes chalk or bolts, it would conflict. But if their proposal is only crayons, then it&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good proposal. Alternatively, if I propose 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s 5. But maybe that&#x27;s less risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 crayons and 1 chalk, then I could propose 1 crayon and 2 bolts. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>In the absence of information, I think the best is to propose the items I value most. So chalk (3) and bolts (2). So 1 chalk and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s 7. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>
