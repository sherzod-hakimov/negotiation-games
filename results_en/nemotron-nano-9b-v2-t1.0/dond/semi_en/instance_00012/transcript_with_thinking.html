        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, and 1 rope. My value function is lamp:3, thimble:2, rope:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary to theirs. If both proposals can be fulfilled, we get points based on our values; otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>First, I should think about what items are most valuable to me. The lamp is worth 3, which is the highest. Then thimbles at 2 each, and rope at 1. Since there are 3 thimbles, maybe splitting them could be good. But I need to consider that the other player might also value them. <br/><br/>If I take the lamp, that&#x27;s 3 points. Then maybe take some thimbles. But if I take all three thimbles, that&#x27;s 6 points. But maybe the other player also wants thimbles. Alternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope. The rope is only 1 point, but maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t want it. <br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. So I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. For example, if I take the lamp and some thimbles, and leave the rope for them. But if the other player also wants the rope, that could be a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t want the rope, they might accept. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>Another approach: since there are 3 thimbles, maybe split them. If I take 2 thimbles and the lamp, that&#x27;s 3 + 2*2 = 7. The other player could take 1 thimble and the rope. But I don&#x27;t know their values. <br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to decide what to propose. The key is to maximize my own score. So I should propose items that I value highly. The lamp is the most valuable. So I should definitely propose the lamp. Then, maybe take as many thimbles as possible. But if I take all three, that&#x27;s 3*2=6. But if the other player also wants thimbles, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and one thimble. That&#x27;s 3+2=5. Then the other player could take the remaining two thimbles and the rope. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Maybe the best is to take the lamp and the rope. Because the rope is only 1 point, but maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t value it as much. Or maybe they do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and two thimbles. That&#x27;s 3 + 2*2 = 7. If the other player can take the remaining thimble and the rope, that&#x27;s possible. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the proposals are complementary. So if I propose the lamp and two thimbles, and the other player proposes the remaining thimble and the rope, then together they have all items. That would work. <br/><br/>But how do I know if the other player will propose that? Since I can&#x27;t communicate except through messages, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s clear. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that I can send up to 5 messages, but the secret proposal is a specific format. So maybe I should first send a message to the other player, but the problem says that unless it&#x27;s the secret proposal, messages are transmitted. But the user hasn&#x27;t given me any previous messages. So maybe I need to start by making a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Wait, the instructions say that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should just make a secret proposal now. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. <br/><br/>So I need to decide which items to propose. Let me think. If I take the lamp and two thimbles, that&#x27;s 3 + 2*2 = 7. The other player could take the remaining thimble and the rope. If their value for the thimble is, say, 2, then they get 2 + 1 = 3. But if they value the rope more, maybe they would take it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the lamp and the rope, that&#x27;s 3 + 1 = 4. The other player could take all three thimbles, which would be 3*2=6. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score. The lamp is the highest value, so I should definitely take that. Then, maybe take as many thimbles as possible. But if I take all three, that&#x27;s 6. But if the other player also wants thimbles, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe take the lamp and one thimble. That&#x27;s 5. Then the other player can take two thimbles and the rope. If they value the thimbles, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But I need to make a proposal. Let me think of possible combinations. <br/><br/>Option 1: Propose lamp and two thimbles. <br/><br/>Option 2: Propose lamp and rope. <br/><br/>Option 3: Propose lamp and three thimbles. <br/><br/>Option 4: Propose lamp, one thimble, and rope. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if I propose too many items, the other player might not have enough. For example, if I take all three thimbles, then the other player can&#x27;t take any. But if they also want thimbles, that&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and one thimble. That leaves two thimbles and the rope. The other player could take those. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the proposals are complementary. So if I propose lamp and one thimble, and the other player proposes two thimbles and the rope, then together they have all items. That would work. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 lamp, 1 thimble]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe [Proposal: 1 lamp, 2 thimbles]. <br/><br/>But which is better? If I take two thimbles, that&#x27;s 4 points. If I take one, 2 points. But if the other player can take the remaining thimbles, maybe that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. However, since I want to maximize my own score, I should take as much as possible. So maybe take the lamp and two thimbles. <br/><br/>But then the other player could take the remaining thimble and the rope. If they value the thimble, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the lamp and the rope, that&#x27;s 4. The other player could take three thimbles. If they value thimbles, that&#x27;s 6. <br/><br/>But again, I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be contested. For example, the rope is only 1 point. If I take the rope, maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t want it. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t want the rope, they can take the thimbles. <br/><br/>But I&#x27;m not sure. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and one thimble. That&#x27;s 5. The other player can take two thimbles and the rope. <br/><br/>But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>Since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose. Maybe the best is to take the lamp and two thimbles. That gives me 3 + 2*2 = 7. If the other player can take the remaining thimble and the rope, that&#x27;s possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the lamp and the rope, that&#x27;s 4. The other player can take three thimbles. <br/><br/>But which is better? If the other player values thimbles highly, then taking two thimbles might be better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to take the lamp and two thimbles. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 lamp, 2 thimbles]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe take the lamp and one thimble. <br/><br/>But I think taking two thimbles is better for me. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, and 1 rope. My values are lamp:3, thimble:1, rope:4. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed the available items. For example, if I ask for the lamp and the rope, and the other player also asks for the lamp, that&#x27;s a conflict. So I need to propose items in a way that there&#x27;s a chance the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me but maybe lower for them. Alternatively, maybe split the high-value items. Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict. For example, the rope is worth 4 to me. If I take the rope, that&#x27;s a big gain. But if the other player also wants it, we both get nothing. So maybe I should propose the rope and some thimbles. But thimbles are only worth 1 each. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. But if the other player also wants the lamp, that&#x27;s a problem. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should go for the highest value items. <br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I can&#x27;t base my decision on that. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Maybe propose the rope and some thimbles. Let me think. If I take the rope (4 points) and maybe a thimble (1 point), that&#x27;s 5. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the rope, then I can get it. But if they do, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. But again, if they also want the lamp, that&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the rope. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. Let me check the available items. There&#x27;s 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, 1 rope. So if I take the lamp and rope, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player could take the thimbles. But if their proposal includes the lamp or rope, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the rope and some thimbles. For example, &quot;Proposal: 1 rope, 2 thimbles&quot;. That way, if they don&#x27;t take the rope, I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. But again, same issue. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and some thimbles. But the lamp is worth 3, which is less than the rope&#x27;s 4. So maybe the rope is better. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the rope, and the other player also takes it, we both get zero. So maybe I should propose the rope and some thimbles. Let me think. If I propose 1 rope and 2 thimbles, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the rope, then I get 4 + 2*1 = 6. If they do include the rope, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the lamp and the rope, that&#x27;s 3 +4=7. But if they also want the lamp or rope, then zero. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the highest value items. So the rope is 4, which is the highest. So I should propose the rope. Maybe also some thimbles. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the rope and the lamp. But again, same problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the rope and 3 thimbles. But that&#x27;s all the thimbles. If the other player also wants thimbles, but since there are 3, maybe that&#x27;s possible. <br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. But since the goal is to maximize my own score, I should propose items that I value highly and that are less likely to be taken by the other player. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the rope and the lamp. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes either, then conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the rope and some thimbles. Let me go with that. So my proposal would be &quot;Proposal: 1 rope, 2 thimbles&quot;. That way, I get the rope (4) and 2 thimbles (2), total 6. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the rope, then I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose just the rope. &quot;Proposal: 1 rope&quot;. That&#x27;s 4 points. If they don&#x27;t take it, I get 4. If they do, zero. <br/><br/>But maybe adding thimbles could be better. But if I take 2 thimbles, that&#x27;s 2 points. So total 6. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. But again, same risk. <br/><br/>I think the best bet is to propose the rope. Since it&#x27;s the highest value item. So my secret proposal would be &quot;Proposal: 1 rope&quot;. That&#x27;s straightforward. <br/><br/>But wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, if they proposed the lamp and thimbles, then my proposal of the rope would be complementary. But if they proposed the rope, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. So I&#x27;ll go with the rope. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and the rope. But again, same risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the lamp and some thimbles. But the lamp is 3, which is less than the rope&#x27;s 4. <br/><br/>So I think the best is to propose the rope. So the secret proposal would be &quot;Proposal: 1 rope&quot;.<br/></p>
