        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge. My value function is hat:4, pen:2, sponge:0. So I really want the hat and the pens, but the sponge is worthless to me. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value the sponge more? Or maybe they don&#x27;t care about the hat. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should try to maximize my own gain while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items based on their proposal. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other&#x27;s don&#x27;t overlap in items. <br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by proposing to take the hat and all the pens. That would be [Proposal: 1 hat, 3 pens]. Then the other player would have to take the sponge. But if they also want the sponge, but since I don&#x27;t value it, maybe they would take it. But if their proposal includes the sponge, then my proposal and theirs would be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the hat and pens, and they propose to take the sponge, then that&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, like the hat, then there&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Since the sponge is worthless to me, maybe the other player might want it. So if I take the hat and pens, and they take the sponge, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hat and some pens, leaving some pens for them. But if they value pens, that might be better. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>Another approach: since the sponge is worthless to me, maybe I should leave it for the other player. So my proposal would be 1 hat and 3 pens. Then the other player can take the sponge. If they accept, then I get 4 + 2*3 = 10 points. If they don&#x27;t, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player might not want the sponge. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hat and 2 pens, leaving 1 pen and the sponge. But that might not be as good. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the secret proposal is made at any time. So maybe I should just make the secret proposal now. Let me check the format. The secret proposal is in square brackets. So I should send [Proposal: 1 hat, 3 pens]. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. If they propose something else, like the hat, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if they propose the sponge, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message first to ask them what they want. But the rules say that messages are transmitted directly, so I can&#x27;t ask questions. I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>So the best move is to propose taking the hat and all pens. That way, if the other player takes the sponge, we both get points. If they propose something else, like the hat, then we both get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best possible proposal. <br/><br/>So I should make the secret proposal now. The message would be [Proposal: 1 hat, 3 pens].<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my own score. The items available are 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge. My values are hat:4, pen:0, sponge:6. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed the available quantities. For example, if I ask for the hat and sponge, and the other player also asks for the same, that&#x27;s a problem because there&#x27;s only one of each. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don&#x27;t overlap in a way that exceeds the available items.<br/><br/>Since I value the sponge the most (6 points), I should definitely try to get that. The hat is next (4 points), and pens are worthless to me. So my priority is sponge first, then hat. <br/><br/>But I need to consider what the other player might want. If they also value the sponge highly, they might have proposed for it. If I don&#x27;t get the sponge, I get zero. So maybe I should propose for the sponge and maybe the hat. But if the other player also wants the sponge, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, if they proposed for pens, which I don&#x27;t care about, then I can take the sponge and hat. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a safe bet.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the problem states that if the proposals are complementary, we get points based on our own values. So I need to propose items that are likely to be available.<br/><br/>Given that there&#x27;s only one hat and one sponge, if I propose for both, and the other player also proposes for both, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But if I propose for sponge and hat, and the other player proposes for something else, like pens, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose for the sponge and hat. Because if they also want those, then we can&#x27;t both have them. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get both. Alternatively, maybe I should propose for the sponge and some pens, but since pens are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not helpful. <br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible regardless. Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose for the sponge and hat, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the sponge and pens, then the total items would be 1 sponge (mine) + 1 sponge (theirs) which is not possible. So that would result in zero. But if their proposal is pens and something else, then it&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose for the sponge and pens, but since pens are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not good. So the best bet is to propose for the sponge and hat. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is for the sponge. If I also propose for the sponge, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So maybe I should propose for the hat and sponge, but if the other player also wants the sponge, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose for the sponge and some pens. But since pens are worthless, that&#x27;s not helpful. <br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let me think about the possible items. The other player might have proposed for the sponge, or the hat, or pens. <br/><br/>If I propose for the sponge and hat, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is for the sponge, then we can&#x27;t both have it. But if their proposal is for pens, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose for the sponge and pens, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is for the hat, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my chances. <br/><br/>Another angle: the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but maybe I can infer based on their possible strategy. For example, if they are trying to get the sponge, which is valuable to me, they might have proposed for it. <br/><br/>But without knowing, I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>So, given that, I should propose for the sponge and hat. Because if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get both. If they do, then we might have a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose for the sponge and some pens. But since pens are worthless, that&#x27;s not helpful. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose for the sponge and pens, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is for the hat, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the sponge, then it&#x27;s not. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose for the sponge and hat. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 sponge, 1 hat]. <br/><br/>But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible. The available items are 1 hat and 1 sponge. So if I take both, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include them, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is for the sponge, then we can&#x27;t both have it. But if I propose for the sponge and hat, and they propose for the hat, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose for the sponge and some pens. But since pens are worthless, that&#x27;s not helpful. <br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is to take the sponge and hat. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get both. If they do, then it&#x27;s a conflict, but I can&#x27;t do anything about that. <br/><br/>Therefore, my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 sponge, 1 hat].<br/></p>
