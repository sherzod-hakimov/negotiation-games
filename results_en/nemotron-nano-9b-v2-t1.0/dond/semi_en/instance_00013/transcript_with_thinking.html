        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My value function is paper:1, clock:1, potato:2. So potatoes are the most valuable to me, followed by papers and clocks equally.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items more. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should try to propose items that are valuable to me but maybe less so to them, or find a balance.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (enough items for both), we get points based on our values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I propose and the ones the other player proposes don&#x27;t overlap in a way that we don&#x27;t have enough.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal that maximizes my value while leaving enough for the other player to also get something.<br/><br/>Let me think. The total items are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. If I take all the potatoes (2), that&#x27;s 2*2=4 points. Then maybe take some papers. But if I take all potatoes, the other player might not have any. But if I take 1 potato, maybe they can take the other. But I need to know their value function. Since I don&#x27;t, maybe I should propose a mix.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe a safe approach is to propose items that are high value to me but not too many, so that the other player can also get some.<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is made by me. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player will see it. But if I make a secret proposal, they might adjust their own. But since I can&#x27;t communicate except through messages, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is optimal for me, considering that the other player might have a different value function.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should first send some messages to negotiate. But the problem says that messages are transmitted directly, so I need to be careful. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that is as good as possible for me, while leaving enough items for the other player to also get something.<br/><br/>Let me calculate. Suppose I take 2 potatoes (value 4), 2 papers (value 2), and 1 clock (value 1). Total 7. But then the other player would need to take the remaining 2 papers, 1 clock, and 0 potatoes. But if they value potatoes more, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe take 1 potato (2), 2 papers (2), and 1 clock (1). Total 5. Then the other player can take 2 potatoes, 2 papers, 1 clock. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 0 clocks. That&#x27;s 4 + 2 = 6. Then the other player can take 0 potatoes, 2 papers, 2 clocks. But if they value clocks more, that&#x27;s good for them. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 1 paper, 1 clock. That&#x27;s 2 +1 +1=4. Then the other player can take 3 papers, 1 clock, 1 potato. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the items I value most. So 2 potatoes (4), 2 papers (2), and 0 clocks. That&#x27;s 6. Then the other player can take the remaining 2 papers and 2 clocks. If they value clocks more, they might accept. But if they value potatoes more, they might not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 1 paper, 1 clock. That&#x27;s 2+1+1=4. Then the other player can take 3 papers, 1 clock, 1 potato. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 potato, 2 papers, 1 clock. That&#x27;s 2+2+1=5. Then the other player can take 3 potatoes, 2 papers, 1 clock. But again, depends.<br/><br/>But since the secret proposal is made by me, and the other player will see it, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, while leaving enough for them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. Maybe the best is to propose the items I value most, and hope that the other player can take the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 0 clocks. That&#x27;s 6. Then the other player can take 0 potatoes, 2 papers, 2 clocks. If they value clocks more, that&#x27;s good. But if they value potatoes more, they might not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 1 paper, 1 clock. That&#x27;s 4. Then the other player can take 3 papers, 1 clock, 1 potato. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That&#x27;s 4+2+1=7. But then the other player would need to take 0 potatoes, 0 papers, 1 clock. But that&#x27;s only 1 clock. If they value clocks, maybe they can take that. But if they need more, they might not.<br/><br/>But the problem is that if the proposals are not complementary, both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I propose and the other player&#x27;s proposal don&#x27;t overlap in a way that there&#x27;s not enough.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 0 clocks. That&#x27;s 6. Then the other player can take 0 potatoes, 2 papers, 2 clocks. If they value clocks, that&#x27;s good. But if they value potatoes, they might not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 1 paper, 1 clock. That&#x27;s 4. Then the other player can take 3 papers, 1 clock, 1 potato. But again, depends.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose the one that maximizes my value, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. So maybe 2 potatoes (4), 2 papers (2), and 0 clocks. Total 6. That&#x27;s the maximum I can get if the other player takes the remaining 2 papers and 2 clocks. But if they can&#x27;t take that, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes, 1 paper, 1 clock. That&#x27;s 4. Then the other player can take 3 papers, 1 clock, 1 potato. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since the secret proposal is made by me, and the other player will see it, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. So I&#x27;ll go with 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 0 clocks. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player can take the remaining 2 papers and 2 clocks, then we both get points. If not, we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My values are paper: 0, clock: 4, potato: 1. So clocks are super valuable to me, potatoes are a bit, and papers don&#x27;t matter.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I should consider possible scenarios. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose something that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap in items, and maximizes my own value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that covers as much of the high-value items as possible. Since clocks are worth 4 each, I should try to get both clocks. Potatoes are 1 each, so maybe take one or both. Papers are worthless to me, so maybe leave them to the other player.<br/><br/>But how to structure the proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think. If I take both clocks, that&#x27;s 2 clocks. Then maybe one potato. That would be [Proposal: 2 clocks, 1 potato]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take those, I get them. But if they also want clocks, then we both get zero. But since clocks are valuable to me, maybe it&#x27;s worth the risk. Alternatively, maybe take one clock and both potatoes. But that&#x27;s 1*4 + 2*1 = 6. If I take both clocks and one potato, that&#x27;s 2*4 +1=9. That&#x27;s better. But if the other player also wants clocks, then we both get nothing. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not taking clocks. Since I don&#x27;t know, but I have to make a proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then we get the items. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But since I don&#x27;t know, perhaps the best approach is to propose the items I value most. So clocks and potatoes. Let me check the available items. There are 2 clocks and 2 potatoes. If I take both clocks and both potatoes, that&#x27;s 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. But if the other player also takes some of those, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 10. But if I take both clocks and both potatoes, and they take something else, like papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they also take clocks or potatoes, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take one clock and one potato. That&#x27;s 4 +1=5. But that&#x27;s less than taking both. But maybe it&#x27;s safer. But the problem is that I don&#x27;t know their proposal. So perhaps the best strategy is to propose the maximum possible value for me, which is both clocks and both potatoes. But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible. The items are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. So if I take 2 clocks and 2 potatoes, that&#x27;s all of them. Then the other player can&#x27;t take any of those. But if their proposal includes any of those, then we both get zero. But if their proposal is only papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since my value for clocks is high, it&#x27;s worth the risk. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, [Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 potatoes]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get them. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I have to maximize my score, this might be the best bet. Alternatively, maybe propose 2 clocks and 1 potato. That&#x27;s 9. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But without information, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess. However, given that the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should just propose the items I value most. So clocks and potatoes. Let me go with that. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 potatoes]. That&#x27;s the maximum I can get. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, I get 10. If it does, zero. But since I have to choose, this seems like the best option.<br/></p>
