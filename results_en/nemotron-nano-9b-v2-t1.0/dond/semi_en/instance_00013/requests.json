So clocks are super valuable to me, potatoes are a bit, and papers don't matter.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I should consider possible scenarios. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose something that, when combined with theirs, doesn't overlap in items, and maximizes my own value.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that covers as much of the high-value items as possible. Since clocks are worth 4 each, I should try to get both clocks. Potatoes are 1 each, so maybe take one or both. Papers are worthless to me, so maybe leave them to the other player.\n\nBut how to structure the proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think. If I take both clocks, that's 2 clocks. Then maybe one potato. That would be [Proposal: 2 clocks, 1 potato]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't take those, I get them.

However, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then we get the items. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn't overlap. But since I don't know theirs, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But since I don't know, perhaps the best approach is to propose the items I value most. So clocks and potatoes. Let me check the available items. There are 2 clocks and 2 potatoes. If I take both clocks and both potatoes, that's 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. But if the other player also takes some of those, then we both get zero. But if they don't, then I get 10. But if I take both clocks and both potatoes, and they take something else, like papers, then it's okay. But if they also take clocks or potatoes, then it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take one clock and one potato. That's 4 +1=5. But that's less than taking both. But maybe it's safer. But the problem is that I don't know their proposal. So perhaps the best strategy is to propose the maximum possible value for me, which is both clocks and both potatoes. But I need to check if that's possible. The items are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. So if I take 2 clocks and 2 potatoes, that's all of them. Then the other player can't take any of those. But if their proposal includes any of those, then we both get zero. But if their proposal is only papers, then it's okay. But since I don't know, maybe it's a gamble. However, since my value for clocks is high, it's worth the risk. Alternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, [Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 potatoes]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include those, I get them. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I have to maximize my score, this might be the best bet. Alternatively, maybe propose 2 clocks and 1 potato. That's 9. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But without information, it's a bit of a guess. However, given that the other player's proposal is secret, maybe I should just propose the items I value most. So clocks and potatoes. Let me go with that. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 potatoes]. That's the maximum I can get. If the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, I get 10. If it does, zero. But since I have to choose, this seems like the best option.\n",

For example, if they proposed papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But since I don't know, perhaps the best approach is to propose the items I value most. So clocks and potatoes. Let me check the available items. There are 2 clocks and 2 potatoes. If I take both clocks and both potatoes, that's 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. But if the other player also takes some of those, then we both get zero. But if they don't, then I get 10. But if I take both clocks and both potatoes, and they take something else, like papers, then it's okay. But if they also take clocks or potatoes, then it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take one clock and one potato. That's 4 +1=5. But that's less than taking both. But maybe it's safer. But the problem is that I don't know their proposal. So perhaps the best strategy is to propose the maximum possible value for me, which is both clocks and both potatoes. But I need to check if that's possible. The items are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. So if I take 2 clocks and 2 potatoes, that's all of them. Then the other player can't take any of those. But if their proposal includes any of those, then we both get zero. But if their proposal is only papers, then it's okay. But since I don't know, maybe it's a gamble. However, since my value for clocks is high, it's worth the risk. Alternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, [Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 potatoes]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include those, I get them. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I have to maximize my score, this might be the best bet. Alternatively, maybe propose 2 clocks and 1 potato. That's 9. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 papers, then I can take clocks and potatoes. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But without information, it's a bit of a guess. However, given that the other player's proposal is secret, maybe I should just propose the items I value most. So clocks and potatoes. Let me go with that. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 2 clocks, 2 potatoes]. That's the maximum I can get. If the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, I get 10. If it does, zero. But since I have to choose, this seems like the best option.\n",
