                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize my score. The items available are 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, and 2 boxes. My value function is stick:5, towel:2, toy:1, box:1. So the stick is super valuable to me, then the towel, then the toy and boxes are less.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. But since I can't know, I should try to get the items I value most. The stick is my top priority. If I can get the stick, that's 5 points. Then maybe the towel for 2. The toy and boxes are lower, but maybe I can get some of them if needed.\n\nThe rules say I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is when I send a message in the specific format. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal early to lock in the items I want. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. If both proposals are complementary, we get the items. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo my first move should be to propose the items I want. Let me think. If I propose the stick and the towel, that's 5+2=7. But if the other player also wants those, we might not get them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and some other items. But since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should propose the stick and maybe the boxes? Or maybe just the stick?\n\nWait, the problem is that if I propose the stick, and they propose something else, but if their proposal doesn't include the stick, then maybe we can both get the stick? No, because the stick is only one. So if I take the stick, they can't. So maybe I need to propose the stick and maybe some other items that I value, but also consider that the other player might have different preferences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then see. But if the other player also wants the stick, then we can't both have it. So maybe I should propose the stick and maybe some lower value items. But since I don't know their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the stick and maybe some other items. Let me check the format. The secret proposal is in square brackets: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]\". So I need to list the items I want. For example, \"[Proposal: 1 stick, 1 towel]\".\n\nBut if I do that, the other player might propose something else. If their proposal is complementary, then we get the items. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player's proposal.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the items I value most. So stick and towel. But if the other player also wants those, then we can't both have them. So maybe I should propose the stick and maybe the boxes? Or maybe just the stick?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the toy. But the toy is only worth 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then if the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, we get them. But if they also want the stick, then we can't. So maybe I need to make a proposal that is as specific as possible to my high-value items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by sending a message to the other player, but the rules say that messages are transmitted directly, so I need to be careful. But the first message could be a secret proposal. Let me think. The user is asking me to start the negotiation. So I should make a secret proposal first.\n\nSo my first message would be a secret proposal. Let me decide what to propose. Since the stick is worth 5, I should definitely include that. Then maybe the towel (2) and maybe a box (1). But if I take the stick, towel, and a box, that's 5+2+1=8. But if the other player also wants some of these, it might not work. Alternatively, maybe just the stick and the towel. Let me go with that.\n\nSo the secret proposal would be \"[Proposal: 1 stick, 1 towel]\". That's my first message. Then the other player would respond. If their proposal is complementary, we get the items. If not, zero. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make the best guess. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the stick. Because if I take the stick, that's 5, and maybe the other player can take the rest. But if they also want the stick, then we can't. But maybe the other player's value function is different. For example, maybe they value the towel more. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes. But boxes are only 1 each. So 5+1+1=7. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the toy. 5+1=6. But again, not sure.\n\nBut since the stick is the highest value, I should prioritize that. So I think the best first move is to propose the stick and maybe the towel. Let me go with that. So my first message is the secret proposal: \"[Proposal: 1 stick, 1 towel]\".\n"

The items available are 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, and 2 boxes. My value function is stick:7, towel:3, toy:0, box:0. So I really want the stick and the towel, but the toy and boxes don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they're trying to get certain items. My goal is to propose something that complements their proposal so that both can get their items. If our proposals overlap on items, then we both get zero. So I need to make sure that whatever I propose doesn't conflict with theirs.\n\nWait, but since their proposal is secret, I can't know exactly what they have. Hmm. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, hoping that the other player's proposal doesn't include those. But since I don't know their proposal, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are the stick and towel. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then we can both get them. But if they did include them, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should take a risk here. Alternatively, maybe propose only the stick, or only the towel, to minimize overlap. But if I propose both, and they also proposed both, then we both get zero. But if they only proposed one, then maybe we can split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can counter. But without knowing their proposal, it's hard. Wait, the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. So I need to make my own secret proposal. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (no overlapping items), then we both get the items. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo my goal is to propose items that I value, but not overlapping with theirs. Since I don't know theirs, maybe I should propose the items I value the most, hoping that they didn't propose them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that I don't value much, but that's not helpful. Wait, but if I propose items I don't value, then even if they are accepted, I get nothing. So that's not good.\n\nSo the best strategy is to propose the items I value the most. Let's say I propose the stick and the towel. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then I get both, which is great. If they did include one or both, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's proposal is something else. Alternatively, maybe they proposed the toy and boxes, which I don't care about. Then my proposal of stick and towel would be complementary, and I get both. But if they proposed stick or towel, then conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a guess. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the stick. If they didn't propose the stick, then I get it. If they did, then zero. Similarly for the towel. But which is better? Since the stick is worth 7, which is higher than the towel's 3. So maybe prioritize the stick.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose both stick and towel. If the other player's proposal is, say, the toy and boxes, then we can both get our items. But if they proposed stick or towel, then conflict. But since I don't know, it's a gamble. However, given that the other player is also trying to maximize their score, they might have proposed items they value. But I don't know their value function. Wait, the problem only gives my value function. The other player's value function is secret. So I can't know what they value. So I have to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value, but without knowing their proposal.\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are stick and towel. If the other player's proposal is complementary, then I get both. If not, zero. Alternatively, maybe propose only the stick. If they didn't take it, I get 7. If they did, zero. But maybe the other player's proposal is something else. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know. So perhaps the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So I'll go with proposing the stick and the towel. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: [Proposal: 1 stick, 1 towel]. That's the format. So I should send that as my secret proposal.\n"
