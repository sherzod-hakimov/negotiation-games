My value function is thread: 0, bolt: 1, picture: 7. So threads are worthless to me, bolts are worth 1 each, and the picture is super valuable at 7.\n\nThe goal is to maximize my score. Since threads don't matter to me, I should probably try to get the picture and as many bolts as possible. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine. If our proposals are complementary, meaning they don't overlap in items, then we both get our items. Otherwise, we both get zero.\n\nSo, the key is to propose items that the other player might not want, or that we can both agree on. But since I don't know the other player's value function, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they also value the picture highly, or maybe they don't. But since I need to maximize my own score, I should focus on getting the picture and bolts.\n\nWait, but if I propose the picture and some bolts, and the other player also proposes the picture, then we can't both have it. So that would result in zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn't conflict with theirs. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to them. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and some bolts, and hope that the other player doesn't propose the same. But if they do, we both get zero. So maybe I should propose the picture and as many bolts as possible, but also leave some items for the other player. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and some bolts, and the other player might propose something else. But since I can't know, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the picture and some bolts. Let me think about the possible combinations.\n\nThe picture is the most valuable. If I can get the picture, that's 7 points. Then, bolts are 1 each. So if I can get the picture and, say, 3 bolts, that's 7 + 3*1 = 10. But if the other player also wants the picture, then we can't both have it. So maybe I should propose the picture and some bolts, but not all. Or maybe propose the picture and some bolts, and the other player might propose something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and some bolts, and the other player might propose the remaining items. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. But since my value for threads is zero, I don't care about them. So maybe I can take all the bolts and the picture, but that might not be possible if the other player also wants them.\n\nWait, but the other player's value function is secret. So I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain, assuming that the other player might not want the same items. For example, if I propose the picture and all 3 bolts, then if the other player's proposal doesn't include those, we can both get them. But if they do, then we get zero. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose the picture and some bolts, and leave some items for the other player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and 2 bolts. Then, if the other player proposes the remaining 1 bolt and the threads, which they might value less. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the picture and 3 bolts. If the other player doesn't propose those, I get 7 + 3 = 10. If they do, we get zero. But maybe the other player's value for the picture is lower. But since I can't know, I have to take the risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and 1 bolt. Then, if the other player takes the rest, but again, not sure.\n\nBut the problem is that if I make a secret proposal, it's a one-time thing. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I don't know the other player's values, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. But again, without info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and some bolts, and the other player might propose the threads. Since threads are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. But I don't know. However, if I take the picture and bolts, and the other player takes threads, then we can both get our items. That would be good.\n\nSo, for example, if I propose [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 bolts], and the other player proposes [Proposal: 2 threads], then we can both get our items. That would be ideal. But if the other player also wants the picture or bolts, then it's a problem.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the picture and as many bolts as possible, and hope that the other player doesn't propose the same. Alternatively, maybe propose the picture and some bolts, and leave some items for the other player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and 2 bolts. Then, if the other player takes the remaining 1 bolt and the threads, that's possible. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the picture and 3 bolts. If the other player doesn't want those, I get 10. If they do, we get zero. But maybe the other player's value for the picture is lower. For example, if they value the picture less than 7, but I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the picture and 1 bolt. Then, if the other player takes the rest, but again, not sure.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize my own score, I should take the highest value items. So the picture is 7, which is the highest. So I should definitely try to get the picture. Then, bolts are 1 each. So getting as many as possible.\n\nSo my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 bolts]. That way, if the other player doesn't propose those, I get 7 + 3 = 10. If they do, we get zero. But maybe the other player's value for the picture is lower. For example, if they value the picture at 5, then they might not want to take it. But I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the picture and 2 bolts. Then, if the other player takes 1 bolt and the threads, that's possible. But again, depends.\n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal once, I need to make the best possible one. So I think the best bet is to propose the picture and all 3 bolts. That way, if the other player doesn't want them, I get 10. If they do, we get zero.

So it's a risk.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose the picture and as many threads as possible. Because threads are valuable to me. So maybe [Proposal: 2 threads, 1 picture]. That way, if their proposal doesn't include the picture or the threads, I get 2*3 +4=10. If they do include the picture or threads, then we both get zero. But maybe that's the best possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the picture. That's 4. If they don't take it, I get 4. If they do, zero. But maybe that's safer. But if I take the picture, and they take something else, then I get 4. But if I take the picture and threads, maybe I can get more.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, it's a gamble. However, the goal is to maximize my expected score. But without knowing their proposal, it's hard. But maybe the best is to propose the picture and threads, as that's the highest value for me. So I'll go with that.\n",
