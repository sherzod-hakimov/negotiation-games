                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My value function is apple:1, soap:3, egg:4. So I value the egg the most, then soap, then apples. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions or try to propose items that are valuable to me while considering possible overlaps. The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. If they overlap, both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I propose don't conflict with what the other player might propose.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But wait, the rules say that the secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So if I send a message with square brackets, it's considered a secret proposal. Otherwise, messages are transmitted directly. \n\nBut the problem is that I don't know the other player's value function. So maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict. \n\nThe items are 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So the soap and egg are single items. If I take the soap and egg, that's two items. But if the other player also wants those, then we can't both get them. So maybe I should propose the egg and soap, but that might be risky. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and some apples. \n\nWait, but if I propose the egg and soap, and the other player also proposes those, then we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal is something that the other player might not want. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to them. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and some apples. Since the egg is the most valuable to me, I should definitely get that. Then, maybe the soap is also valuable, but if the other player also wants it, that's a problem. So maybe I should take the egg and some apples, and leave the soap for the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and hope that the other player doesn't propose those. But if they do, we both get zero. So maybe a safer approach is to propose the egg and some apples. Let's say I propose the egg and 2 apples. That way, I get the egg (which is worth 4) and 2 apples (worth 2), total 6. If the other player doesn't propose the egg or those apples, then it's okay. \n\nBut how do I know if the other player is going to propose those? Since I can't know, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So I should send that. \n\nWait, the instructions say that if I make a secret proposal, it's formatted as \"[Proposal: ...]\". So I need to decide what to propose. Let me think. If I propose the egg and the soap, that's two items. But if the other player also proposes those, we both get zero. Alternatively, if I propose the egg and some apples, maybe that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and then in the messages, I can try to negotiate. But the problem is that the messages are transmitted directly, so I need to make sure that my messages don't conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know what I proposed. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their scores. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player also makes a secret proposal, then we check if they are complementary. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me. So the best case is to get the egg and the soap. But if the other player also wants those, then we both get zero. So maybe I should propose the egg and some apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and then in the messages, I can try to convince the other player to not take those. But since messages are direct, maybe I can't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn't propose those, then I get them. But if they do, we both get zero. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should take the highest value items. So the egg is 4, soap is 3, apples are 1 each. So the best is to get the egg and soap. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the egg and one apple. That's 4 +1 =5. If the other player takes the soap and the remaining apples, that's 3 + 2*1=5. But if they take the same items, we both get zero. \n\nBut without knowing their values, it's hard. Maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal for the egg and the soap. Let me do that. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap]. That way, I get both high-value items. If the other player doesn't propose those, then I get them. If they do, we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and some apples. Let's say [Proposal: 1 egg, 2 apples]. That's 4 + 2 =6. If the other player doesn't take those, I get them. If they do, we both get zero. \n\nBut which is better? If the other player values the soap more, maybe they would take it. But since I don't know, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and then in the messages, I can try to suggest that the other player take the apples. But since messages are direct, maybe I can't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal for the egg and the soap. Let me go with that. So the secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap]. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their score. So if I propose the egg and soap, and the other player proposes something else, then I get those items. But if they also propose the same, then zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and then in the messages, I can try to get the other player to agree to take the apples. But since messages are direct, maybe I can't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal for the egg and the soap. That's my best bet. So I'll send that as my secret proposal.\n",

If they did, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their proposal, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose for the apples, but that's not valuable. Hmm.
