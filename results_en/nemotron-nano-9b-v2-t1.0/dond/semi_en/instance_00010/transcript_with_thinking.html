        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 bucket, 3 knives, and 1 battery. Both of us have secret value functions where each item is worth 2. So, each of us values every item equally. <br/><br/>Since the goal is to maximize my score, I should aim to get as many items as possible. But I have to consider that the other player might also want items. The key here is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), then we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get nothing. <br/><br/>Since all items are equally valued, the optimal strategy would be to propose items in a way that maximizes my share without leaving too many items for the other player. But since we can only send up to 5 messages each, maybe I should make a secret proposal early to avoid back-and-forth.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say I can send a maximum of 5 messages each or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal right away. Because if I do that, I can specify exactly what I want, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, we both get the items. Otherwise, we get nothing. <br/><br/>But since both of us have the same value function, maybe the other player would also want as many items as possible. So if I take all the items, the other player would have nothing, but if I take some, maybe we can split. However, since the items are 1 bucket, 3 knives, 1 battery. Let&#x27;s count the total items: 1+3+1=5 items. <br/><br/>If I propose to take all 5 items, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be empty, but maybe they would also propose something. But if I take all, then their proposal can&#x27;t be fulfilled, so we both get zero. That&#x27;s bad. So I need to propose a subset that leaves some items for the other player. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose half of the items. But since the items are different, maybe split them. For example, take 2 knives and the battery, and leave 1 knife and the bucket. But since the other player&#x27;s value function is the same, they would also want as much as possible. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose to take 2 knives and the battery, and the other player proposes to take the bucket and 1 knife, then together we have 2+1=3 knives, 1 bucket, 1 battery. That&#x27;s all items. So that would be complementary. Then each gets their items. My score would be 2*2 (knives) + 2 (battery) = 6. The other player gets 2 (bucket) + 2 (knife) = 4. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the bucket and 2 knives, and the other takes 1 knife and the battery. That&#x27;s also all items. My score would be 2+2+2=6. Same as before. <br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better way. Since all items are equally valued, the optimal is to get as many items as possible. But if I take more, the other player might not have enough. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take 3 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 4 items. Then the other player could take the bucket. That&#x27;s 1 item. But since the other player&#x27;s value function is same, they would want as much as possible. But if I take 3 knives and battery, and they take the bucket, that&#x27;s all items. So that&#x27;s complementary. My score would be 3*2 + 2 = 8. That&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might not agree to that. But since we can make a secret proposal, maybe I should propose that. Because if I make a secret proposal, the other player can either accept or not. But if I make a secret proposal, they can&#x27;t see it until they make their own. Wait, no. The secret proposal is made by me, and the other player can see it? Or is it secret? The rules say &quot;secret proposal&quot;, so maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t know my proposal until they make their own. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say: &quot;You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.&quot; So a secret proposal is a message that is not transmitted to the other player. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t know what I proposed. Then, when they make their own proposal, they can see my secret proposal? Or is it that the secret proposal is only known to me? <br/><br/>This is a bit unclear. But according to the rules, the secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So when I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s a message that is not sent to the other player. So the other player doesn&#x27;t know my secret proposal. Therefore, if I make a secret proposal, the other player can&#x27;t base their proposal on it. <br/><br/>Therefore, if I make a secret proposal, I can propose something that I think is optimal, and then the other player will make their own proposal. If their proposal is compatible with mine, then we both get the items. Otherwise, we get nothing. <br/><br/>So, since I want to maximize my score, I should propose a set of items that I can get, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s value function is the same as mine, they would also want as many items as possible. So if I take too many, they might not have enough. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 2 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player could take the bucket and 1 knife. That&#x27;s 2 items. Total items: 3+2=5. So that&#x27;s all items. So that would be complementary. My score would be 2+2+2=6. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 3 knives and the battery (4 items), and the other takes the bucket (1 item). That&#x27;s 5 items. So that&#x27;s also complementary. My score would be 3*2 + 2 = 8. That&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>But would the other player agree to that? If I make a secret proposal of 3 knives and battery, then the other player, not knowing my proposal, might propose something else. For example, they might propose to take the bucket and 3 knives. But if I have already taken 3 knives and battery, then their proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But since the secret proposal is not transmitted, the other player doesn&#x27;t know my proposal. So they might propose something that conflicts. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as good as possible. Since I can&#x27;t communicate, maybe the best is to take as many items as possible without leaving too much for the other player. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s value function is same, they would also want to take as many as possible. So if I take 3 knives and battery, and they take the bucket, that&#x27;s good. But if they take more, like 3 knives and battery, then there&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose a set that is as large as possible, but not overlapping. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take 2 knives and the battery. Then the other player could take the bucket and 1 knife. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them. Total 5. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 1 bucket, 1 knife, and 1 battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player could take 2 knives. That&#x27;s 2 items. Total 5. <br/><br/>But in that case, my score is 2+2+2=6. <br/><br/>But if I take 3 knives and battery, that&#x27;s 4 items. Then the other player takes the bucket. That&#x27;s 1 item. So my score is 8. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal is to take the bucket and 3 knives, then there&#x27;s a conflict. But since I made a secret proposal, they don&#x27;t know that. So they might propose to take the bucket and 3 knives. Then, if I had proposed 3 knives and battery, and they propose bucket and 3 knives, then the total would be 3+3=6 knives, but there are only 3. So that&#x27;s not possible. Therefore, the proposals are not complementary, and we both get zero. <br/><br/>So that&#x27;s a risk. Therefore, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose a smaller set. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose to take 2 knives and the battery. Then the other player could take the bucket and 1 knife. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them. Total 5. <br/><br/>But if the other player proposes to take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal of 2 knives and battery would conflict with their 3 knives. So again, no. <br/><br/>Hmm. This is tricky. Since both of us have the same value function, the optimal is to split the items as evenly as possible. But since the items are different, maybe the best is to take the bucket and 2 knives, and leave 1 knife and the battery. But then the other player could take the battery and 1 knife. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I take bucket and 2 knives, and they take battery and 1 knife, that&#x27;s all items. So that&#x27;s complementary. My score would be 2+2+2=6. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 3 knives and the battery, and they take the bucket. That&#x27;s 4 items for me, 1 for them. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal is to take the bucket and 3 knives, then my proposal of 3 knives and battery would conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of 2 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then, if the other player proposes to take the bucket and 1 knife, that&#x27;s 2 items. Total 5. <br/><br/>But if the other player proposes to take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal of 2 knives and battery would conflict with their 3 knives. So that&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 bucket, 1 knife, and 1 battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player could take 2 knives. That&#x27;s 2 items. Total 5. <br/><br/>But again, if the other player proposes to take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>This seems like a game theory problem where both players are trying to maximize their own gain. Since both have the same value function, the Nash equilibrium would be to split the items. <br/><br/>But since I can make a secret proposal, maybe I should propose to take 2 knives and the battery. That way, even if the other player takes the bucket and 1 knife, I get 3 items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 knives and the battery. If the other player takes the bucket, that&#x27;s good. But if they take something else, it might conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose a set that is as large as possible, but not overlapping. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 bucket, 1 knife, and 1 battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player can take 2 knives. <br/><br/>But again, if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 2 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player can take the bucket and 1 knife. <br/><br/>But if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal of 2 knives and battery would conflict. <br/><br/>So the risk is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal is to take more knives, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose a set that is as large as possible, but not overlapping. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 bucket, 2 knives, and 1 battery. That&#x27;s 4 items. Then the other player can take 1 knife. <br/><br/>But if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But again, since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of 3 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 4 items. Then, if the other player takes the bucket, that&#x27;s 1 item. Total 5. <br/><br/>But if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal of 3 knives and battery would conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 2 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then, if the other player takes the bucket and 1 knife, that&#x27;s 2 items. <br/><br/>But if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s value function is same, they would also want to take as many items as possible. So if I take 3 knives and battery, they might take the bucket. <br/><br/>But if I take 2 knives and battery, they might take the bucket and 1 knife. <br/><br/>In any case, the best I can do is to propose a set that maximizes my items, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. <br/><br/>Since I can make a secret proposal, I should do that. <br/><br/>So, the best secret proposal would be to take 3 knives and the battery. That&#x27;s 4 items. Then, if the other player takes the bucket, that&#x27;s 1 item. <br/><br/>But if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose 3 knives and battery. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 knives and the battery. <br/><br/>But which is better? <br/><br/>If I take 3 knives and battery, my score is 8. If I take 2 knives and battery, it&#x27;s 6. <br/><br/>But the risk is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal conflicts, I get nothing. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose 3 knives and battery. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 knives and the battery. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 bucket, 1 knife, and 1 battery. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player can take 2 knives. <br/><br/>But again, if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Hmm. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 bucket and 2 knives. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player can take 1 knife and the battery. <br/><br/>That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them. <br/><br/>But if they take 3 knives and the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But again, I can&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Since all items are equally valued, the optimal is to get as many as possible. So I should propose to take 3 knives and the battery. <br/><br/>But I need to format it as a secret proposal. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 3 knives, 1 battery]<br/><br/>But I need to check the format. The format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. <br/><br/>So for 3 knives and 1 battery, it would be &quot;[Proposal: 3 knives, 1 battery]&quot;. <br/><br/>Yes. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 2 knives and 1 battery, that&#x27;s 3 items. <br/><br/>But 3 knives and 1 battery is 4 items. <br/><br/>So I think that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>Therefore, I should make a secret proposal of 3 knives and 1 battery. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>So the answer is to make a secret proposal of 3 knives and 1 battery.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 bucket, 3 knives, and 1 battery. My values are bucket:3, knife:2, battery:1.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available. For example, if I ask for the bucket and two knives, and the other player asked for the battery and one knife, that would work because together they take all items. But if either of us asks for more than available, it&#x27;s a no-go.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s flexible. Maybe I should ask for items that are high value to me but not too many. Let&#x27;s think: the bucket is my highest value (3), then knives (2 each), then battery (1). So I should prioritize getting the bucket and maybe some knives.<br/><br/>But if I ask for the bucket and two knives, that&#x27;s 3 items. The other player might have asked for the battery and one knife. Then together, that&#x27;s all items. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is different, maybe they also want the bucket. Then there&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. That&#x27;s two items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is three knives, then that&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the bucket. Then the other player could take the rest. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be compatible. Maybe I should propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s two items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and two knives, that would work. Or if they have the battery and one knife, then I have bucket and one knife, and they have battery and one knife, but there are three knives total. So that would leave one knife unclaimed. But maybe that&#x27;s okay as long as both proposals are fulfilled.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. That&#x27;s two items. Then the other player could take the three knives. That would be complementary. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the bucket. Then the other player can take the rest. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Hmm. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the safest way is to propose items that are high value to me but not too many. Let&#x27;s think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose the bucket and two knives, that&#x27;s 3 items. The other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include the bucket or more than one knife. For example, if they proposed the battery and one knife, then together we have all items. But if they proposed the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the bucket and the battery, that&#x27;s two items. The other player could take the three knives. That&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the bucket. Then the other player can take the rest. But again, if they also want the bucket, it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s as specific as possible. Let me think about the possible combinations.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. For example, if I propose the bucket and two knives, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is three knives, it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal includes the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should make a proposal that is as high value as possible for me, while not being too restrictive. Let me calculate the possible values.<br/><br/>If I get the bucket (3) and two knives (2 each), that&#x27;s 3 + 2*2 = 7. If I get the bucket and one knife, that&#x27;s 3 + 2 = 5. If I get the bucket and the battery, that&#x27;s 3 + 1 = 4. If I get just the bucket, 3. If I get three knives, 6. But the battery is only 1.<br/><br/>So the highest possible for me is 7 (bucket + two knives). But that requires that the other player doesn&#x27;t take the bucket or more than one knife. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the bucket and one knife, then we can&#x27;t both get that. So maybe I should propose the bucket and two knives, hoping that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the bucket or more than one knife.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s 5. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and two knives, then together we have all items. That would be good. But if their proposal is the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket. Then if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and three knives, that&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as likely as possible to be complementary. Maybe the best approach is to propose the bucket and two knives. That&#x27;s a high value for me, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal is different, maybe not. But it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. That&#x27;s 4. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is three knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. That&#x27;s a safe bet. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the bucket and two knives. Let me check the total items. If I take bucket (1), two knives (2), that&#x27;s 3 items. The other player would need to take the remaining 1 knife and 1 battery. So their proposal would need to be 1 knife and 1 battery. If that&#x27;s their proposal, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if their proposal is, say, the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and one knife. Then the other player could take the battery and two knives. That would be complementary. So that&#x27;s another possibility.<br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard to say. However, since the goal is to maximize my score, I should propose items that are high value to me. The bucket is the highest, so I should definitely try to get that. Then, maybe take as many knives as possible without conflicting.<br/><br/>So, if I propose the bucket and two knives, that&#x27;s 3 items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s complementary. That would give me 3 + 2*2 = 7, and them 1 + 2 = 3. Total 10, which is all items. That&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if their proposal is the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But maybe they didn&#x27;t propose the bucket. Since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. But maybe they are also trying to get the bucket. So there&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. That&#x27;s 4. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is three knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. That&#x27;s 3 + 1 = 4 for me, and 2*3=6 for them. Total 10. That&#x27;s also good.<br/><br/>But which is better? If I get the bucket and two knives (7) vs bucket and battery (4). The first is better. So I should go for that.<br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the bucket, then my proposal would conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should take the risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s 5. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and two knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. That would be 5 for me and 1 + 2*2 = 5 for them. Total 10. That&#x27;s also good.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe they are also trying to get the bucket. So if I propose the bucket, there&#x27;s a chance of conflict. But if I don&#x27;t propose the bucket, I might not get it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and two knives. Let me think. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal is the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t propose the bucket, then it&#x27;s okay.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is three knives, it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the bucket and two knives. That&#x27;s the highest possible value for me. Let me go with that.<br/></p>
