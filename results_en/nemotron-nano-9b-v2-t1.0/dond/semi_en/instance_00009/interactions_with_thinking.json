                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My value function is candy: 2, fruit: 2, hat: 0. So I value candies and fruits equally, and the hat doesn't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my own gain regardless. The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose taking certain items, the other player's proposal should not conflict with mine.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose.\n\nMy goal is to get as many high-value items as possible. Since candies and fruits are both worth 2 each, I should aim to get as many of those as possible. The hat is worthless to me, so maybe I can offer it to the other player if needed.\n\nBut I don't know the other player's preferences. If they value the hat highly, maybe I should give it to them. But since I don't know, perhaps the safest approach is to take all the candies and fruits, and leave the hat. But wait, if I take all 3 candies and 2 fruits, that's 5 items. The other player might propose something that conflicts. But if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can lock in my items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit for the other player. But why? Because if the other player also wants those, maybe splitting could be better. But without knowing their values, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their items. So if I propose taking all candies and fruits, and the other player proposes something that doesn't conflict, then we both get our items. But if their proposal conflicts, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible with the other player's proposal.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and leave the hat. For example, propose [Proposal: 3 candies, 2 fruits]. That way, I get all the high-value items. If the other player's proposal doesn't take any of those, then it's compatible. But if they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit. That way, there's a chance the other player might take the remaining items. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 candy and 1 fruit, leaving 2 candies and 1 fruit. But that might not be optimal for me.\n\nWait, the hat is worthless to me. So maybe I can offer the hat to the other player. But if I don't include it in my proposal, maybe they can take it. But if I don't mention it, they might not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the hat. But since I don't value it, that's not helpful. Unless the other player values it highly. But again, I don't know.\n\nSo the safest bet is to take all the candies and fruits. Let me check the numbers. 3 candies and 2 fruits. That's 5 items. The other player's proposal would need to not take any of those. But if they take any, then it's a conflict. But if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can lock in my items. So I should send the secret proposal now.\n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 candies, 2 fruits]. That way, I get all the high-value items. If the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, then I get 3*2 + 2*2 = 10 points. If their proposal conflicts, we both get zero. But since I don't know their proposal, this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose less to leave room for the other player, but that might reduce my own score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 2 candies and 1 fruit. Then the other player could take 1 candy and 1 fruit. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to say. But if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, I get 2*2 + 1*2 = 6. If the other player takes 1 candy and 1 fruit, they get 2+2=4. But if their proposal is different, maybe they take more. But this is speculative.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize my own score, taking all the high-value items is better. So I think the best move is to make a secret proposal for 3 candies and 2 fruits. That way, if the other player's proposal is compatible, I get the maximum possible. If not, we both get zero. But maybe that's the best strategy here.\n"

The items available are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My value function is candy:1, fruit:1, hat:5. So the hat is super valuable to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they're trying to get the hat? Or maybe they have a different strategy. Since I don't have their proposal details, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that, when combined with theirs, don't exceed the available quantities. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the hat, since it's worth 5 to me. If I can get the hat, that's a big gain. But if the other player also wants the hat, then our proposals might conflict. But since their proposal is secret, I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. Wait, the problem doesn't give me the other player's value function. So I have to assume that they might have different preferences. \n\nBut since I need to maximize my own score, I should focus on getting the items I value most. The hat is the most valuable. So maybe I should propose the hat. But if the other player also proposed the hat, then we can't both have it. So maybe I should propose the hat and some other items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a combination that's likely to be accepted. For example, if I propose the hat and some candies, and the other player's proposal doesn't include the hat, then we can both get the hat. But if they did propose the hat, then we can't. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the hat and some other items. Let me think. If I propose the hat, then if the other player's proposal doesn't include the hat, we can both get it. If they did, then we can't. But since I can't know, maybe it's better to propose the hat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. For example, if I propose 2 candies and 1 fruit, and the other player's proposal is something else. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard. \n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we get the items. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn't exceed the available items. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, if I propose the hat, then if they didn't propose it, we can both get it. If they did, then we can't. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose the hat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is likely to be complementary. For example, if I propose 1 hat, 1 candy, and 1 fruit. Then, if the other player's proposal is, say, 2 candies and 1 fruit, then together we have 3 candies (which is available), 2 fruits (available), and 1 hat. That would work. But if their proposal is different, maybe not. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the safest way is to propose the hat. Because if they didn't take it, I get 5 points. If they did, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's proposal is also for the hat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a combination that includes the hat and some other items. For example, [Proposal: 1 hat, 2 candies]. That way, if the other player's proposal is, say, 1 fruit and 1 candy, then together we have 3 candies (available), 1 fruit (available), and 1 hat. That would work. \n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a gamble. However, since the hat is worth 5, it's better to try to get it. So I think the best move is to propose the hat. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hat]. That's the most valuable item. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the hat, then we both get it. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose more items. For example, [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 candy, 1 fruit]. But that might be too much. If the other player's proposal is similar, then we might exceed the available items. \n\nBut since the available items are 3 candies, 2 fruits, 1 hat. If I propose 1 hat, 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the other player proposes, say, 2 candies and 1 fruit, then total candies would be 1+2=3 (okay), fruits 1+1=2 (okay), hat 1. So that works. \n\nBut if the other player's proposal is 1 hat, 2 candies, then we would have 2 hats, which is not possible. So that would be a conflict. \n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a risk. However, since the hat is so valuable, I think it's worth the risk. \n\nSo I'll go with proposing the hat. That's my secret proposal.\n"
