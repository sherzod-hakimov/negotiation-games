My value function is candy: 2, fruit: 2, hat: 0. So I value candies and fruits equally, and the hat doesn't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my own gain regardless. The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose taking certain items, the other player's proposal should not conflict with mine.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose.\n\nMy goal is to get as many high-value items as possible. Since candies and fruits are both worth 2 each, I should aim to get as many of those as possible. The hat is worthless to me, so maybe I can offer it to the other player if needed.\n\nBut I don't know the other player's preferences. If they value the hat highly, maybe I should give it to them. But since I don't know, perhaps the safest approach is to take all the candies and fruits, and leave the hat. But wait, if I take all 3 candies and 2 fruits, that's 5 items. The other player might propose something that conflicts. But if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can lock in my items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit for the other player. But why? Because if the other player also wants those, maybe splitting could be better. But without knowing their values, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their items. So if I propose taking all candies and fruits, and the other player proposes something that doesn't conflict, then we both get our items. But if their proposal conflicts, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible with the other player's proposal.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and leave the hat. For example, propose [Proposal: 3 candies, 2 fruits]. That way, I get all the high-value items. If the other player's proposal doesn't take any of those, then it's compatible. But if they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit. That way, there's a chance the other player might take the remaining items. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 candy and 1 fruit, leaving 2 candies and 1 fruit. But that might not be optimal for me.\n\nWait, the hat is worthless to me. So maybe I can offer the hat to the other player. But if I don't include it in my proposal, maybe they can take it. But if I don't mention it, they might not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the hat. But since I don't value it, that's not helpful. Unless the other player values it highly. But again, I don't know.\n\nSo the safest bet is to take all the candies and fruits. Let me check the numbers. 3 candies and 2 fruits. That's 5 items. The other player's proposal would need to not take any of those. But if they take any, then it's a conflict. But if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can lock in my items. So I should send the secret proposal now.\n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 candies, 2 fruits]. That way, I get all the high-value items. If the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, then I get 3*2 + 2*2 = 10 points. If their proposal conflicts, we both get zero. But since I don't know their proposal, this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose less to leave room for the other player, but that might reduce my own score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 2 candies and 1 fruit. Then the other player could take 1 candy and 1 fruit. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to say. But if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, I get 2*2 + 1*2 = 6. If the other player takes 1 candy and 1 fruit, they get 2+2=4. But if their proposal is different, maybe they take more. But this is speculative.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize my own score, taking all the high-value items is better. So I think the best move is to make a secret proposal for 3 candies and 2 fruits. That way, if the other player's proposal is compatible, I get the maximum possible. If not, we both get zero.
