        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize my score. The items available are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, and 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:6, berry:0, bowl:1, glass:1. So the shovel is super valuable to me, but berries don&#x27;t matter. The bowl and glasses each give me 1 point each.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should focus on my own values. The key is to get the shovel because that&#x27;s worth 6 to me. The other items are less valuable. <br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or maybe they can take the rest. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some other items that I don&#x27;t care about, like berries, to make sure the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose the shovel, and the other player also proposes the shovel, then we can&#x27;t both have it, so we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with theirs. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the shovel and some other items that I don&#x27;t value much, so that the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some berries, but since berries are worthless to me, maybe the other player might want them. But if I take the berries, that might not be good. Hmm. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem is that I have to make a secret proposal. The other player will also make a secret proposal. If our proposals are complementary, we both get the items. Otherwise, zero. So the goal is to propose items that the other player isn&#x27;t proposing. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some items that I don&#x27;t care about, so that the other player can take the rest. For example, if I propose the shovel and maybe some berries, but since berries are worthless to me, maybe the other player would take them. But if I take the berries, that&#x27;s not good. Wait, but if I propose the shovel and some berries, and the other player proposes the bowl and glasses, then maybe we can split. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl, since the bowl is worth 1 to me. But if the other player also wants the bowl, that&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. Since glasses are worth 1 each, but I have 3. If I take 1 or 2, maybe that&#x27;s okay. But again, without knowing the other player&#x27;s values, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, maybe the best approach is to propose the shovel and maybe some items that I don&#x27;t value much, so that the other player can take the rest. For example, if I propose the shovel and maybe some berries, but since berries are worthless to me, maybe the other player would take them. But if I take the berries, that&#x27;s not good. Wait, but if I propose the shovel and some berries, and the other player proposes the bowl and glasses, then we can split. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. If the other player doesn&#x27;t propose the bowl, then I can get both. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest way is to propose the shovel and maybe some items that I don&#x27;t care about. For example, the shovel and 2 berries. Since berries are worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values them. If they take the berries, that&#x27;s good for them, but I don&#x27;t lose anything. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just propose the shovel. Because if I can get the shovel, that&#x27;s 6 points. The other items are less valuable. So if I can get the shovel, that&#x27;s the best. <br/><br/>But how to ensure that the other player doesn&#x27;t also propose the shovel. Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the shovel and maybe some other items that I don&#x27;t care about. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that there are enough items to fulfill both. So if I propose the shovel, and the other player proposes, say, the bowl and glasses, then we can both get them. But if the other player also proposes the shovel, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>So the key is to propose the shovel and maybe some other items that the other player might not want. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should just propose the shovel. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player also values the shovel. So if I propose the shovel, and they do too, we both get zero. So that&#x27;s bad. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and some items that I don&#x27;t value, so that the other player can take the rest. For example, if I propose the shovel and 2 berries, then the other player can take the bowl and glasses. But if they also want the shovel, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want the bowl, then I can get both. But if they do, then conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the shovel and maybe some berries. Because berries are worthless to me, but maybe the other player might want them. If they take the berries, then I can get the shovel. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. Since glasses are 1 each, but I have 3. If I take 1 or 2, maybe that&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing the other player&#x27;s values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I have to make a proposal that maximizes my expected score. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have any information about their values, maybe the best is to propose the shovel and maybe some items that I don&#x27;t care about. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. Because the bowl is worth 1 to me. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want the bowl, then I can get both. If they do, then conflict. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the berries. Since berries are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. If they take the berries, then I can get the shovel. <br/><br/>But if they also want the shovel, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Hmm. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want the bowl, then I get both. If they do, then conflict. <br/><br/>But since the bowl is worth 1 to me, maybe it&#x27;s better to take it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should just propose the shovel. Because that&#x27;s the most valuable item. <br/><br/>But if the other player also proposes the shovel, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and some other items that I don&#x27;t care about. <br/><br/>But how to format the proposal. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. <br/><br/>So for example, [Proposal: 1 shovel, 2 berries]. <br/><br/>But if I do that, and the other player proposes, say, 1 bowl, 3 glasses, then we can split. <br/><br/>But if the other player also proposes the shovel, then conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the shovel and maybe some berries. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the berries. Since berries are worthless to me, but maybe the other player might take them. <br/><br/>But if I take the berries, that&#x27;s not good. Wait, no, if I propose the shovel and berries, and the other player proposes something else, then I can get the shovel and berries. But since berries are worth 0 to me, that&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the shovel, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the shovel. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. <br/><br/>But I think the safest is to propose the shovel. Because that&#x27;s the highest value item. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel]. <br/><br/>But maybe I can add some other items. For example, [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the bowl, then conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [Proposal: 1 shovel, 2 berries]. <br/><br/>But again, same issue. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. <br/><br/>But I think the key is to get the shovel. So I&#x27;ll go with that. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 shovel]. <br/><br/>But maybe I should also include some other items to make it more likely that the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the berries. <br/><br/>But since berries are worthless to me, maybe the other player would take them. <br/><br/>But if I take the berries, that&#x27;s not good. Wait, no, if I propose the shovel and berries, and the other player takes the berries, then I can get the shovel. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the shovel, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the shovel. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. <br/><br/>But again, same problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. <br/><br/>But I think the best is to propose the shovel. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 shovel].<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. First, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, right, in the initial setup, the user is supposed to simulate the other player&#x27;s proposal. But in this case, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s proposal. Wait, maybe this is part of a role-play where I have to imagine the other player&#x27;s proposal. But since I don&#x27;t have that data, how can I proceed?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on my own value function. But the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So I need to respond to that. But without knowing what the other player proposed, I can&#x27;t make an informed decision. This is a bit confusing. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps in the context of this exercise, the other player&#x27;s proposal is not given, and I have to make a proposal that would be optimal given my own value function. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning they don&#x27;t overlap in items, then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that the other player isn&#x27;t proposing, so that my proposal and theirs can be complementary.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that covers items I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value the most, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is different, then we can both get points. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to infer. But since this is a simulation, perhaps I should proceed by making a proposal that maximizes my own value, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is not conflicting. For example, if I propose items that I value highly, like the shovel and bowl, which are worth 4 each. The other player might have proposed different items. <br/><br/>Wait, the available items are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:4, berry:1, bowl:4, glass:0. So I should prioritize shovel and bowl. If I propose those, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include them, then I can get both. But if the other player also proposed those, then we can&#x27;t both get them. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible. Let me think. The maximum I can get is 4+4=8 if I get both shovel and bowl. But if the other player also wants those, then we can&#x27;t. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be wanted by the other player. But without knowing their value function, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I can&#x27;t know, so I have to make a proposal that is optimal for me. So I should propose the items I value the most. So shovel and bowl. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: &quot;[Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]&quot;. <br/><br/>But wait, the other player might have proposed something else. For example, if they proposed berries and glasses, then my proposal of shovel and bowl would be complementary. But if they proposed shovel and bowl, then we can&#x27;t both get them. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have that info, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most. So I&#x27;ll go with shovel and bowl. That&#x27;s my best bet. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose more items. But since I have limited messages, but the secret proposal is a one-time thing. So I should make sure my proposal is as valuable as possible. <br/><br/>Another thought: the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I can&#x27;t know. But maybe the optimal strategy is to propose items that are unique or that I value highly. Since I value shovel and bowl the most, I should propose those. <br/><br/>So I think the best move is to submit a secret proposal for shovel and bowl. That way, if the other player didn&#x27;t propose those, I can get them. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>
