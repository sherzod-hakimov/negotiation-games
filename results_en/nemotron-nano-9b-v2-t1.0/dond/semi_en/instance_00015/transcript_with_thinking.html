    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, and 1 eraser. My value function is bowl:5, bottle:5, fruit:0, eraser:0. So I really want the bowl and bottle, and the fruits and eraser don&#x27;t matter to me. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my chances of getting the items I value. <br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other&#x27;s don&#x27;t overlap on items that are limited. <br/><br/>Since I have a secret proposal option, maybe I should make a secret proposal to get the items I want. But the problem is that if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know what I&#x27;m proposing. Wait, no. The secret proposal is made by me, and the other player would have to accept it. But how does that work? The rules say that you can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So if I make a secret proposal, that&#x27;s one message, and the other player can either accept or reject. But since the other player&#x27;s value function is unknown, maybe I should propose the items I want, and hope they accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send messages to negotiate. But since I can only send 5 messages, and the other player can too, but I need to be efficient. <br/><br/>Let me think. My goal is to get the bowl and bottle. The other player might also want those. So if I propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes something else, maybe we can agree. But if they also want those, then we might have a conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value most. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. That way, if the other player accepts, I get both. If they don&#x27;t, then maybe they propose something else. But if they also propose the same items, then we can&#x27;t both have them, so both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player might propose to take the fruits and eraser. But since the fruits and eraser are worthless to me, that&#x27;s okay. But if the other player&#x27;s value function is different, maybe they want the bowl or bottle. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest way is to make a secret proposal for the bowl and bottle. That way, if the other player is okay with that, I get them. If not, maybe they can propose something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player first. For example, &quot;I want the bowl and bottle. What do you want?&quot; But the problem is that messages are transmitted directly, so I need to be careful not to include any response to the rules. <br/><br/>Wait, the instructions say that unless it&#x27;s the secret proposal, messages are directly transmitted. So I can send messages to the other player, but they have to be in the form of proposals or other messages. <br/><br/>But the secret proposal is a specific format. So maybe I should first send a message to the other player, like &quot;I&#x27;m proposing to take the bowl and bottle. Do you agree?&quot; But the other player might not respond, or they might have their own proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, since I can make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should just make that proposal immediately. Because if I don&#x27;t, the other player might make a proposal that conflicts with mine. <br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, the other player can either accept or reject. If they accept, then we both get the items. If they reject, then maybe they can make their own proposal. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, maybe the best is to propose the items I want. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player might propose to take the fruits and eraser. But since the fruits and eraser are worthless to me, that&#x27;s fine. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they also want the bowl or bottle, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But given that I can&#x27;t know, the best I can do is to propose the items I value. So I&#x27;ll go with the secret proposal for bowl and bottle. <br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So if I propose bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes something else, like fruits and eraser, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if the other player also proposes bowl and bottle, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>So maybe I should make a secret proposal for bowl and bottle. That way, if the other player is okay with that, I get them. If not, maybe they can propose something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player first. For example, &quot;I want the bowl and bottle. What do you want?&quot; But the other player might not respond, or they might have their own proposal. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, and the other player can too, maybe it&#x27;s better to make a secret proposal early. <br/><br/>So I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal for the bowl and bottle. That way, if the other player accepts, I get them. If they don&#x27;t, then maybe they can propose something else. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that my proposal is in the correct format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets, like [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with that. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So yes, that&#x27;s correct. <br/><br/>Therefore, my first message should be the secret proposal for bowl and bottle. That&#x27;s the most efficient way to get the items I value. If the other player accepts, great. If not, maybe they can propose something else, but since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, 1 eraser. My values are bowl:1, bottle:0, fruit:3 each, eraser:3.<br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player proposed. Wait, the user mentioned that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but in the current context, I don&#x27;t have that information. Oh, right, maybe in the actual scenario, the other player&#x27;s proposal would be given. But since this is a simulation, perhaps I need to proceed as if I know their proposal. Wait, no, the user&#x27;s message says &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; So in this case, I need to generate my proposal based on the assumption that the other player&#x27;s proposal is known. But since I don&#x27;t have that info here, maybe I should think of a general approach.<br/><br/>Wait, but in the problem setup, the user is simulating the game. So perhaps in the actual interaction, the other player&#x27;s proposal would be provided. But in this case, since I&#x27;m supposed to generate my own proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s optimal given possible scenarios. However, without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the input here. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message, they said &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; So in this case, the user is acting as the other player, and I need to respond. But since this is a text-based simulation, perhaps the user will provide the other player&#x27;s proposal in the next step. However, in this case, the user hasn&#x27;t provided it yet. Wait, maybe this is part of a multi-step conversation where the other player&#x27;s proposal is given in a previous message. But in the current context, the user hasn&#x27;t provided that. Hmm, this is confusing.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user is setting up the scenario where I need to generate my proposal after the other player&#x27;s secret proposal. But since I don&#x27;t have that information, maybe I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the input here. But in the given problem, the user hasn&#x27;t provided it. So perhaps this is a test case where I need to generate a proposal based on the items and my value function, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I need to respond to. But without knowing their proposal, how can I decide?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not given here, and I need to make a proposal that is optimal in general. But that&#x27;s not possible. The key is that the proposals must be complementary. So if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, taking the bowl and eraser, then I need to take the bottle and fruits. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that maximizes my value, considering possible overlaps.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. But without that info, I can&#x27;t. So perhaps the correct approach is to make a proposal that includes items I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, since I value fruits and eraser highly (3 each), I should try to get those. The bowl is only worth 1, and the bottle is 0. So maybe I should propose taking the two fruits and the eraser. That would give me 3+3+3=9 points. But if the other player also wants those, then we both get zero. Alternatively, if I take the bowl and eraser, that&#x27;s 1+3=4. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is different.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something like taking the bottle and fruits. Then I need to take the bowl and eraser. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. However, since the user is asking me to submit a proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. So my best bet is to take the items I value most: two fruits and the eraser. That&#x27;s 3*2 +3=9. But if the other player also wants those, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is different. For example, if they take the bowl and bottle, then I can take the fruits and eraser. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, if I propose taking the two fruits and the eraser, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else, then we can both get points. But if their proposal is similar, then we both get zero. So the risk is there. But given that I have to make a proposal, I should go for the highest value items. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 fruits, 1 eraser]. That&#x27;s 2*3 +3=9. Alternatively, maybe include the bowl as well, but that&#x27;s only 1. So 2 fruits and eraser is better. So I think that&#x27;s the best proposal I can make. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to write that. So the answer would be the secret proposal with those items.<br/></p>
