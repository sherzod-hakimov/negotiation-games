                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My value function is frame:8, shoe:2, hammer:0. So I really want the frame, a bit the shoe, and don't care about hammers.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value the frame less, or maybe they want the shoe more. But since I can't know, I should try to propose items that I value highly and maybe leave some for them if possible.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (enough items for both), we get points based on our values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap on items. Since there's only one frame and one shoe, if both want those, it's a problem. But since I can't know their proposal, maybe I should propose the frame and shoe, and maybe some hammers. But since hammers are worthless to me, maybe I can offer them to the other player.\n\nWait, but the other player might also want hammers. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should just take the frame and shoe, and leave the hammers. But if I take both frame and shoe, then the other player can't take them. But if they also propose frame or shoe, then we both get zero. So maybe I should propose only the frame, and maybe some hammers. Or maybe propose the frame and shoe, but that's risky if they also want them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers. Since hammers are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. But since I have to maximize my own score, I should take the frame, which is worth 8. The shoe is worth 2, but if I take it, maybe the other player also wants it. But if I don't take it, maybe they can take it. But if I take both, and they also take them, then we both get zero. So maybe it's better to take the frame and leave the shoe for them. But if they don't want the shoe, then I could take it. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and see if they can take the hammers. But since there are 3 hammers, maybe they can take some. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has a secret value function. So I can't know it. So I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected score. Since I can't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, and hope that they don't also propose them. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose the frame and maybe some hammers. Because if I take the frame, that's 8 points. If I take the shoe, that's 2, but if they also take it, we both get zero. So maybe it's better to take the frame and leave the shoe. But if I don't take the shoe, maybe they can take it. But if they don't want it, then I could take it. But again, without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and if they also propose them, we both get zero. But if they don't, then I get 8+2=10. But if they do, we get zero. So the risk is high. Alternatively, propose only the frame. Then if they don't propose the frame, I get 8. If they do, we both get zero. But maybe that's better. Because 8 is better than risking zero. But maybe the other player is more likely to want the frame. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers. Since hammers are worthless to me, but maybe the other player can take them. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. But if I propose the frame and hammers, then the other player can take the shoe. But if they also want the frame, then we both get zero. So maybe the safest is to propose the frame. Let me think.\n\nIf I propose the frame, then the other player can either take it or not. If they don't, I get 8. If they do, we both get zero. But if I don't propose the frame, maybe they take it, and I get nothing. So proposing the frame is better. But maybe I can also propose the shoe. But again, if they also want it, we both get zero. So maybe the best is to propose the frame. But maybe I can also propose the shoe. Let me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose the frame and shoe, and the other player proposes, say, the shoe and hammers. Then we both get zero because the shoe is in both proposals. But if the other player doesn't propose the shoe, then I get 8+2=10. But if they do, we get zero. So the risk is higher. Alternatively, if I propose only the frame, then the other player can take the shoe. If they do, I get 8. If they don't, I get 8. So that's better. Because even if they take the shoe, I still get the frame. So maybe proposing only the frame is better.\n\nBut wait, the other player might also want the frame. If they propose the frame, then we both get zero. But if I propose the frame, and they don't, I get 8. So the risk is that they might also want the frame. But since I can't know, maybe it's better to propose the frame. Alternatively, maybe I can propose the frame and some hammers. Since hammers are worthless to me, but maybe the other player can take them. But again, without knowing their values, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe. But that's risky. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If I propose frame and shoe, and the other player proposes, say, frame and hammers. Then we both get zero. If they propose shoe and hammers, then we both get zero. If they propose hammers only, then I get 8+2=10. But if they propose frame, then we both get zero. So the risk is that they might propose the frame or shoe. But if I propose only the frame, then the other player can take the shoe. If they do, I get 8. If they don't, I get 8. So that's better. So maybe proposing only the frame is better.\n\nBut maybe the other player is more likely to want the shoe. But again, without knowing, it's hard. But since my value for the shoe is 2, which is less than the frame's 8, maybe it's better to take the frame and leave the shoe. So I should propose the frame. Then, if the other player doesn't take it, I get 8. If they do, we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the frame and some hammers. For example, \"Proposal: 1 frame, 1 hammer\". Then, if the other player takes the shoe and the remaining hammers, I get 8. But if they also take the frame, we both get zero. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. But since hammers are worthless to me, maybe it's better to not include them. Because if I include hammers, maybe the other player can take them, but I don't get any value from them. So maybe it's better to just propose the frame.\n\nSo my first message would be a secret proposal of the frame. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: \"[Proposal: 1 frame]\". That's the format. So I should send that. Then, if the other player doesn't propose the frame, I get 8. If they do, we both get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I can propose the frame and the shoe. But that's riskier. But maybe the other player's value for the shoe is higher. But again, I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the frame and the shoe, and if they don't take them, I get 10. But if they do, zero. But the risk is higher. But maybe the other player's value for the shoe is higher. For example, if they value the shoe as 5, then taking it would be better for them. But since I don't know, it's a gamble. \n\nBut given that my value for the shoe is 2, which is lower than the frame's 8, maybe it's better to focus on the frame. So I'll go with proposing the frame. That's the safest bet. So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 frame].\n"

                    "content": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My values are frame:6, shoe:1, hammer:1. \n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don't know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don't overlap in items), then we both get the items we asked for. Otherwise, we get nothing.\n\nSo my goal is to propose items that the other player isn't likely to have in their proposal. Since I don't know their proposal, I need to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe I can propose items that are less valuable to me but more valuable to them, but since I don't know their values, that's tricky.\n\nWait, but the problem is that I have to submit my own proposal now. The other player's proposal is already secret, so I can't see it. So I need to make a proposal that, given the possible items they might have proposed, maximizes my expected score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me but low value to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. However, maybe I can assume that the other player's values are similar or different. But since I don't have that info, perhaps I should focus on my own values.\n\nMy highest value item is the frame (6). Then shoe (1), then hammers (1 each). So I should try to get the frame. But if the other player also wants the frame, then we can't both have it. So maybe I should propose the frame, and hope that the other player didn't propose it. Alternatively, maybe propose the shoe and hammers, but that's lower value.\n\nBut since the other player's proposal is secret, I can't know. However, maybe the best strategy is to propose the frame, because it's the most valuable to me. If the other player didn't take it, then I get 6. If they did, then we both get nothing. But maybe the other player's proposal is something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose multiple items. For example, frame and shoe. But if the other player also wants those, then it's a conflict. But if they didn't, then I get both. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hammers. Since there are 3 hammers, maybe the other player might not want all of them. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that the items in both proposals don't overlap. So if I propose frame and shoe, and the other player proposes hammers, then it's complementary. But if they also propose frame, then it's not.\n\nSo the key is to propose items that are not in the other player's proposal. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be non-overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed the frame, I should avoid it. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in their proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the frame, because it's the most valuable to me. Even if there's a risk, the potential gain is higher. If the other player also proposed the frame, then we both get nothing. But if they didn't, I get 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shoe and hammers. But that's only 1+1=2, which is less than 6. So the risk of getting nothing is worth it for the higher possible gain.\n\nSo I think the best move is to propose the frame. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: \"[Proposal: 1 frame]\". \n\nBut wait, the other player's proposal is already secret. So I need to make my own secret proposal. The user is now asking me to submit my proposal. So I should send my secret proposal now. \n\nSo the answer should be a secret proposal in the required format. Since I want to maximize my score, I should propose the frame. So the message would be \"[Proposal: 1 frame]\".\n"
