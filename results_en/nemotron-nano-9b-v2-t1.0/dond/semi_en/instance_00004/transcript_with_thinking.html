        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 orange, 1 pepper, and 3 pictures. My value function is orange:5, pepper:2, picture:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary, meaning we can both get what we want without overlapping items.<br/><br/>First, I should think about what items I value the most. The orange is worth 5 to me, which is the highest. Then pepper is 2, and pictures are 1 each. Since there are 3 pictures, maybe I can take some of them. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine.<br/><br/>If I propose taking the orange and maybe some pictures, that might be good. But I need to leave enough items for the other player. Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and the pepper, but that&#x27;s two items. Wait, but the other player might also want those. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an assumption. Maybe they value the orange less, but I can&#x27;t be sure. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That way, I get the highest value item and a lower one. Then the other player could take the pepper and the remaining two pictures. But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible. The total items are 1 orange, 1 pepper, 3 pictures. If I take orange and 1 picture, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player would need to take pepper and 2 pictures. That&#x27;s 3 items. That works. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the pepper is higher. If they value pepper more than I do, then taking the pepper might be better for them. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. That would give me 5+2=7 points. But if the other player also wants those, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So that&#x27;s risky. <br/><br/>Another approach: since there are 3 pictures, maybe I can take all three. But that&#x27;s 3*1=3 points. But if the other player can take the orange and pepper, that&#x27;s better for them. But again, I don&#x27;t know their values. <br/><br/>Wait, the key is to make a proposal that is complementary. So I need to propose items that the other player can also get their items without overlapping. So if I take the orange and one picture, the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That&#x27;s possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the orange and the pepper, then the other player can&#x27;t take those, so they would have to take the three pictures. But if their value for the pictures is low, maybe that&#x27;s not good. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the orange and pepper. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if I take both, the other player might not have anything left. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So if I propose orange and pepper, and the other player proposes something else, like the three pictures, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player can also get their items. So maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. Then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That way, all items are distributed. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. Then the other player can take the three pictures. But if the other player&#x27;s value for the pictures is low, maybe that&#x27;s not ideal. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a choice. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the orange is the most valuable to me, I should definitely take it. Then, for the other items, maybe take the pepper as well. But again, if the other player also wants the pepper, that&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and leave the pepper and pictures for the other player. But that would give me only 5 points. If I can get the pepper as well, that&#x27;s 7. <br/><br/>But the risk is that if the other player also wants the pepper, then my proposal would conflict. So maybe it&#x27;s safer to take the orange and some pictures. <br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. But maybe I can assume that they might value the pepper or pictures. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they do, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is when I send the [Proposal: ...] format. <br/><br/>So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me think. If I propose the orange and the pepper, that&#x27;s two items. The other player would need to propose items that don&#x27;t include those. So they could take the three pictures. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the orange and one picture, then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. <br/><br/>Which is better for me? If I take orange (5) and pepper (2), total 7. If I take orange (5) and one picture (1), total 6. So 7 is better. But the risk is that the other player might also want the pepper. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the orange and pepper. Because even if the other player values the pepper, maybe they can&#x27;t get it if I take it. Wait, no. If I propose the orange and pepper, and the other player proposes something else, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But if the other player also proposes the pepper, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That way, the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That&#x27;s a safe bet. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. Since the orange is the highest value, I should definitely take it. Then, for the other items, maybe take the pepper. But if the other player also wants the pepper, then it&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and leave the pepper and pictures for the other player. But that would give me only 5. <br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to propose the orange and the pepper. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then I get both. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That way, the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. That&#x27;s a safer proposal. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. Let me go with proposing the orange and the pepper. Because that gives me higher value. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, then I get 7. If not, zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the pepper is lower. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values the pictures more. But I can&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That&#x27;s 5+1=6. Then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. If they value the pepper, that&#x27;s good for them. <br/><br/>But I think the orange is the most important. So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the orange and the pepper. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets. So the message would be: [Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]. <br/><br/>Wait, but the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So for example, &quot;1 orange, 1 pepper&quot;. <br/><br/>Yes. So that&#x27;s the proposal. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those items, it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the orange. Then the other player can take the rest. But that&#x27;s 5 points. <br/><br/>But if I can get the pepper as well, that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is to take the orange and the pepper. Let me send that as the secret proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my own score. The items available are 1 orange, 1 pepper, and 3 pictures. My value function is orange:7, pepper:3, picture:0. So I really want the orange and pepper, but the pictures are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they&#x27;re trying to get certain items. My goal is to propose items that complement theirs. If our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then we both get the items we asked for. Otherwise, we both get nothing.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. But how? Maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in their proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but that might conflict with theirs.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value the most, but also consider that if they have a similar proposal, we might conflict. But since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, maybe I should just propose the items I want, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap. Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would give me zero. Or maybe propose items that are not valuable to me, but that&#x27;s not helpful.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and pepper, since those are the items I value. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can both get them. But if they did include them, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the pictures, but since they are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not helpful. Unless the other player values them, but I don&#x27;t know. But since I can&#x27;t see their value function, I have to assume that they might have different values.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that each player has a secret value function. So the other player&#x27;s value function is unknown to me. So I can&#x27;t know what they value. Therefore, my best bet is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the items I want, and if they also propose them, we both get nothing. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would give me zero. So that&#x27;s worse. So the best option is to propose the items I value, even though there&#x27;s a risk of conflict.<br/><br/>But the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their items. So if I propose orange and pepper, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then I get them. If their proposal does include them, then we both get nothing. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to take the risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the orange, or only the pepper. But that might not be optimal. For example, if I propose only the orange, and they propose the pepper, then we can both get them. But if they also propose the orange, then we conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most. So I should propose the orange and pepper. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets, like &quot;[Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]&quot;.<br/><br/>But wait, the user said that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal. So I need to decide what to propose. Since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, I have to make an educated guess. But given that I don&#x27;t have any information about their proposal, maybe I should just propose the items I want. So I&#x27;ll go with orange and pepper. That&#x27;s my best chance to get them. If they also proposed them, we both get zero. But if not, I get them. Since the alternative is to get nothing, it&#x27;s better to take the risk.<br/></p>
