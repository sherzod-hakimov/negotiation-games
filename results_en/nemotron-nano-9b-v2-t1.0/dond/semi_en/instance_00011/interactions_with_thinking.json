                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 whistle, and 2 dice. My value function is pot:2, candy:3, whistle:3, dice:1. So I value candy and whistle the most, then pot, then dice.\n\nThe goal is to maximize my score. Since the other player also has their own secret values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. But since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items more. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items' values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that don't overlap with what the other player might propose. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly but are less likely to be taken by them. \n\nWait, but the other player's proposal is also secret. So I need to make a proposal that's as good as possible given the uncertainty. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also consider that the other player might have different preferences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or have higher value. For example, the pot is worth 2 to me, candy and whistle are 3 each. The dice are only 1 each. So maybe I should propose the candy and whistle, since they are higher value. But if the other player also values those, then there's a conflict. \n\nBut since I can't know their values, maybe I should propose the items I value most. Let me think. If I propose candy and whistle, that's 3+3=6. If the other player's proposal is complementary, then I get 6. But if they also want those, then it's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and one dice. But that's 2+1=3. Not as good. Or maybe the pot and candy? 2+3=5. But again, if the other player also wants those, it's a problem. \n\nWait, but the other player's proposal is also secret. So maybe I should make a proposal that's as good as possible, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. But how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by the other player. For example, if I think the other player values dice more, but I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the items I value most, and if the other player's proposal is different, then we can both get our items. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most. So candy and whistle. Let me check the items: 1 candy, 1 whistle. So if I propose those, and the other player proposes something else, like pot and dice, then we can both get our items. \n\nBut if the other player also proposes candy and whistle, then it's a conflict. But since I can't know, maybe that's the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and one dice. But that's lower value. \n\nWait, but the other player might have different values. For example, if they value the pot more, then they might take it. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the items that are unique. Like, the pot is only one, so if I take it, the other player can't. But if I don't take it, maybe they will. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAnother thought: since the other player's proposal is also secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible, and if it's complementary, then I get my value. \n\nSo, given that, I should propose the items I value the most. So candy (3) and whistle (3). That's 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the pot and candy. 2+3=5. But that's less than 6. \n\nSo the best is to propose candy and whistle. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. But since I can't know, I have to take the risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and one dice. But that's 2+1=3. Not as good. \n\nSo I think the best is to propose candy and whistle. Let me format that as a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the secret proposal needs to be in the format [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I should write [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle]. \n\nBut wait, the numbers are the quantities? Or the values? Wait, the format says \"number\" which is the quantity. Because the items are 1 pot, 1 candy, etc. So for example, if I want to take 1 candy and 1 whistle, the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 candy, 1 whistle]. \n\nBut the numbers in the proposal are the quantities. So I need to specify how many of each item I want. \n\nSo in this case, since there's only 1 candy and 1 whistle, I can propose 1 candy and 1 whistle. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 candy, 1 whistle]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose 1 pot and 1 candy. But that's 2+3=5. \n\nBut again, without knowing the other player's values, it's a gamble. \n\nBut since I want to maximize my score, I should propose the items I value the most. So candy and whistle. \n\nSo I'll make that secret proposal.\n",

I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. \n\nFirst, I should recall the items available: 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 whistle, 2 dice. My value function is pot:8, candy:0, whistle:0, dice:1. So the pot is super valuable to me, and dice are worth 1 each. The other items don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they're trying to get items they value. But since I don't know their value function, I have to make assumptions. However, the key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then we both get the items we asked for. Otherwise, both get zero.\n\nMy goal is to get as much as possible. Since the pot is worth 8 to me, I should definitely try to get the pot. The dice are worth 1 each, so maybe getting one or both dice would be good. The candy and whistle are worthless to me, so I don't care about those.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal doesn't conflict with the other player's. Since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose the pot and one die. That way, if the other player didn't ask for those, we can both get them. Alternatively, if they proposed something else, maybe I can get the pot and a die.\n\nWait, but if I propose the pot and a die, and the other player also proposed the pot, then we can't both get it. So maybe I should propose the pot and maybe a die, but also consider that the other player might have proposed something else. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the pot. If the other player didn't take the pot, then I can get it. But if they did, then we both get zero. But since the pot is so valuable, maybe it's worth the risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and a die, and if the other player didn't take those, I get both. If they did, then I get nothing. But maybe that's better than not getting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and both dice. But that's two dice. If the other player also wants both dice, then we can't. But if they only want one, then maybe I can get both. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard.\n\nBut since I have to make a proposal now, I need to decide. Let me think about possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose the pot and one die, and the other player's proposal is, say, the pot and candy, then we can't both get the pot. So both get zero. But if their proposal is something else, like candy and whistle, then I can get the pot and die. So maybe that's a good balance.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose just the pot, and the other player's proposal is something else, then I get the pot. If they also proposed the pot, then we both get zero. But since the pot is worth 8, maybe it's worth the risk. But if I can get the pot and a die, that's 8+1=9, which is better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is compatible. So maybe the best approach is to propose the pot and one die. That way, if the other player didn't take those, I get both. If they did, then I get nothing. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and both dice. But that's two dice. If the other player also wants both, then conflict. But if they only want one, then I can get both. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and the candy. But candy is worthless to me. So that's not helpful. So better to focus on pot and dice.\n\nSo, the best proposal for me is to take the pot and one die. That way, if the other player didn't take those, I get 8+1=9. If they did, then zero. But since I don't know, it's a gamble. But given that the pot is so valuable, it's worth the risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the pot. If the other player didn't take it, I get 8. If they did, zero. But maybe that's safer. But if I can get the pot and a die, that's better. So I think proposing the pot and one die is better.\n\nSo the secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 dice]. Let me check the format. The format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, ...]. So yes, that's correct. So I should send that as my secret proposal.\n",
