        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My value function is shovel: 0, picture: 0, shell: 10. So I really want the shell, and the other items don&#x27;t matter to me. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my chance of getting the shell. <br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items based on their proposal. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other&#x27;s proposal don&#x27;t overlap in a way that requires more items than available.<br/><br/>Since I value the shell at 10, I should definitely propose to take the shell. The other items (shovels and pictures) I don&#x27;t care about, so maybe I can offer them to the other player to get the shell. But I need to structure my proposal so that the other player is willing to accept, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should just take the shell and offer the rest. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose to take the shell, and the other player proposes something else, maybe they might not have the shell. But if I take the shell, then the other player can&#x27;t. So maybe I should propose to take the shell, and offer the other items. But how to phrase that.<br/><br/>The secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So I need to list the items I want. Since I want the shell, I should propose [Proposal: 1 shell]. But maybe I can also include other items, but since I don&#x27;t value them, maybe it&#x27;s better to just take the shell. <br/><br/>But if I propose only the shell, then the other player might propose something else. However, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell, then my proposal is valid. But if they also propose the shell, then it&#x27;s a conflict. So maybe I should make sure that my proposal is the shell, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the shell and some other items, but since I don&#x27;t care about them, maybe it&#x27;s better to just take the shell. <br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player might also want the shell. Since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the shell and offer the other items. For example, [Proposal: 1 shell, 3 shovels, 2 pictures]. But since I don&#x27;t value the shovels and pictures, maybe that&#x27;s not necessary. But if I do that, the other player might accept if they value those items. However, if they don&#x27;t, they might not. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest way is to propose only the shell. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell, then my proposal is valid. If they do, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>But how to structure the message. The user is supposed to send messages, and then make a secret proposal. The initial message should be a proposal. So maybe I should start by proposing the shell. <br/><br/>So my first message would be [Proposal: 1 shell]. Then, depending on the other player&#x27;s response, I can adjust. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the shell and offer the other items. For example, [Proposal: 1 shell, 3 shovels, 2 pictures]. But since I don&#x27;t value the shovels and pictures, maybe that&#x27;s not necessary. However, if the other player values those items, they might accept. <br/><br/>But if I propose only the shell, then the other player might propose something else. If they propose, say, 2 pictures and 1 shell, then there&#x27;s a conflict. But if they don&#x27;t propose the shell, then my proposal is valid. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the shell and the other items, but that might not be necessary. <br/><br/>Wait, the key is that if both proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So if I propose the shell, and the other player proposes something else, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they also propose the shell, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>So to maximize my chance, I should propose the shell. The other player might not propose the shell, so my proposal would be accepted. <br/><br/>Therefore, my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 shell]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell, I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the shell and some other items, but since I don&#x27;t value them, it&#x27;s better to just take the shell. <br/><br/>So the answer is to make a secret proposal for the shell.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My values are shovel:1, picture:1, shell:5. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities), then we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get nothing.<br/><br/>So my goal is to propose items in a way that maximizes my own value while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal plus mine doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal. The challenge is that I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But maybe I can think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals. The other player might have asked for items that are valuable to them. Since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to assume they might be trying to get the shell, which is the most valuable item for me. But maybe they also value other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they proposed something that&#x27;s not too conflicting. For example, if they took the shell, then I can&#x27;t get it. But if they didn&#x27;t, I can take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. However, since my shell is worth 5, which is much higher than the others, I should prioritize getting the shell if possible.<br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the shell, then my proposal would conflict. So maybe I should propose the shell and see if they also proposed it. If they did, then we both get zero. If not, then I get the shell and they get whatever they proposed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. For example, if I propose 1 shovel and 1 picture, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player might have proposed something else. But I need to maximize my own value.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that I have to submit a secret proposal. So I can&#x27;t communicate anything else. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible with theirs. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is known to me? Wait, no. The user said that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. So I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible given that uncertainty.<br/><br/>In such cases, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many, so that even if the other player also wants some, there&#x27;s a chance they don&#x27;t. For example, the shell is my highest value. If I propose the shell, and the other player didn&#x27;t propose it, then I get 5. If they did, then we both get zero. But if I don&#x27;t propose the shell, maybe I can get other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 pictures and 1 shovel, then I can propose the shell and maybe another shovel. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a proposal now, I need to think of the best possible scenario. Let me think about possible combinations.<br/><br/>The available items are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. So total items: 6.<br/><br/>If I propose the shell, that&#x27;s 1 item. The other player&#x27;s proposal could be anything. If they also proposed the shell, then we both get zero. If not, I get 5. But if I don&#x27;t propose the shell, maybe I can get more items. For example, if I propose 2 shovels and 1 picture, that&#x27;s 3 items. But if the other player also proposed some of those, it might conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shell and see. Since the shell is worth 5, which is higher than the others. So even if there&#x27;s a 50% chance that the other player also wants it, maybe it&#x27;s worth the risk. But I don&#x27;t know their value function. If they value the shell less, maybe they didn&#x27;t propose it. But if they do, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in conflict. For example, if I propose 1 shovel and 1 picture, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player might have proposed something else. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get the sum. Otherwise, zero. So I need to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be compatible with theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best I can do is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many. For example, the shell is the most valuable. So I should propose the shell. If the other player didn&#x27;t propose it, I get 5. If they did, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose multiple items. For example, 1 shovel, 1 picture, and the shell. But that&#x27;s 3 items. If the other player also proposed some of those, it might conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get 1+1+5=7. But if they did, then zero.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the shell is so valuable, maybe it&#x27;s worth the risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shell and some other items that are less likely to be in conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 2 pictures and 1 shovel, then I can propose the shell and another shovel. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shell and see. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If I propose the shell, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell, then I get 5. If they did, then zero. But if I don&#x27;t propose the shell, maybe I can get other items. For example, if I propose 2 shovels and 1 picture, that&#x27;s 3 items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get 1+1+1=3. But if they do, then zero.<br/><br/>But 5 is better than 3. So maybe proposing the shell is better. However, if the other player also proposed the shell, then we both get zero. So the risk is that if they also wanted the shell, then I lose. But if they didn&#x27;t, I gain 5.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a decision. Maybe the best approach is to propose the shell. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in conflict. For example, if I propose 1 shovel and 1 picture, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player might have proposed something else. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shell and another item. For example, 1 shell and 1 shovel. That&#x27;s 2 items. If the other player didn&#x27;t propose the shell, I get 5+1=6. If they did, then zero. But again, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shell and 2 pictures. But there are only 2 pictures. If I take both, and the other player also took both, then conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get 5+1+1=7. But again, the risk is there.<br/><br/>But since the shell is so valuable, maybe it&#x27;s worth the risk. So I think the best move is to propose the shell. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to write that.<br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shell]. That&#x27;s the most valuable item. If the other player didn&#x27;t propose the shell, I get 5. If they did, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose more items. But if I propose more, the chance of conflict increases. For example, if I propose 1 shell and 1 shovel, and the other player also proposed 1 shell and 1 shovel, then conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get 5+1=6. But again, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shell and 2 pictures. But there are only 2 pictures. If I take both, and the other player also took both, then conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t, I get 5+1+1=7. But again, the risk.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a choice. Given that the shell is the highest value, I think proposing the shell is the best bet. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 shell].<br/></p>
