        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 4 magnets, 1 shovel, and 1 flower. My value function is magnet: 0, shovel: 2, flower: 8. So I really want the flower, and the shovel is somewhat valuable, but magnets are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value the flower less than me, or maybe they value the shovel more. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to propose something that&#x27;s likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that the other player would accept, and that doesn&#x27;t conflict with their possible proposal.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal right away. The secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So I should propose items that I want, which are the flower and maybe the shovel. But since I have 4 magnets, which I don&#x27;t care about, maybe I can offer those to the other player if they want them.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose the flower and shovel, and the other player proposes something else, maybe they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as attractive as possible. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the flower, since that&#x27;s the most valuable to me. But if I take the flower, the other player might not get anything, but maybe they can take the shovel and magnets. But if I don&#x27;t take the flower, maybe the other player would take it, which would be bad for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel, and offer the magnets. But if the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they don&#x27;t want the shovel, then my proposal might not be accepted. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a best guess.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the flower is worth 8 to me, I should definitely try to get it. The shovel is 2, which is less. So maybe I should propose the flower and maybe the shovel. But if the other player also wants the flower, then my proposal would conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel, and see if the other player can accept. If they can&#x27;t, then maybe I have to adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the flower, and let the other player take the rest. But if they take the flower, I get nothing. But if I take the flower, I get 8, which is better than nothing. So maybe that&#x27;s the best bet.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that if I propose the flower, and the other player also proposes the flower, then there&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s as specific as possible. So I should propose the flower and maybe the shovel, and offer the magnets. But how to structure the message.<br/><br/>The secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So for example, if I want the flower and the shovel, I would write &quot;[Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]&quot;. But I have 4 magnets. Maybe I can offer them to the other player. But if I don&#x27;t mention them, maybe the other player can take them. But if I don&#x27;t include them in my proposal, maybe they can take them. But if I do include them, maybe I can get them. But since I don&#x27;t value them, maybe it&#x27;s better to not include them in my proposal, so the other player can take them if they want.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be to take the flower and the shovel. That way, I get 8 + 2 = 10 points. The other player would get the 4 magnets, which they might value. But if they don&#x27;t value them, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the flower, and let the other player take the rest. But if they take the flower, I get nothing. So that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the magnets. But since I don&#x27;t value the magnets, that&#x27;s not helpful. So the best option is to propose the flower and the shovel. Let me check the items: 4 magnets, 1 shovel, 1 flower. So if I take 1 flower and 1 shovel, that&#x27;s possible. The other player would get the 4 magnets. If they value the magnets, they might accept. If not, maybe they would propose something else. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]&quot;. That&#x27;s the best I can do given my value function. I hope the other player is okay with that. If they accept, I get 10 points. If not, maybe we have to negotiate, but since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should just make this proposal.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my own score. The items available are 4 magnets, 1 shovel, and 1 flower. My values are magnet:1, shovel:4, flower:2. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available. For example, if I ask for the shovel and flower, and the other player also asks for those, that&#x27;s a problem because there&#x27;s only one of each. But if I take the shovel and they take magnets, that could work.<br/><br/>My goal is to get the items I value the most. The shovel is worth 4, which is the highest. Then the flower is 2, and magnets are 1 each. So ideally, I want the shovel and maybe some magnets. But I have to consider what the other player might want.<br/><br/>If I propose taking the shovel and the flower, that&#x27;s 4+2=6 points. But if the other player also wants those, we both get zero. Alternatively, if I take the shovel and some magnets, maybe that&#x27;s better. Let&#x27;s say I take the shovel and 2 magnets. That&#x27;s 4 + 2*1 = 6. But if the other player takes the flower and the remaining 2 magnets, that&#x27;s 2 + 2*1 = 4. Total would be 6+4=10, which is possible. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. Since I don&#x27;t know, I should make a proposal that&#x27;s as valuable as possible but also leaves room for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take the shovel and one magnet, that&#x27;s 4+1=5. Then the other player could take the flower and 3 magnets, which is 2+3=5. That would be complementary. But if I take the shovel and the flower, that&#x27;s 6, but if the other player also wants those, it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player already made a secret proposal, maybe I should try to counter that. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So I need to make my own secret proposal.<br/><br/>The best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are the shovel and the flower. But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible. If I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take them. But if their proposal is different, maybe it&#x27;s okay. Alternatively, maybe I should take the shovel and some magnets, leaving the flower for the other player. But I don&#x27;t know their value function. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something like taking the shovel and the flower. If that&#x27;s the case, then my proposal should not include those. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Another angle: the total items are 4 magnets, 1 shovel, 1 flower. If I propose to take the shovel and the flower, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player&#x27;s proposal might be similar. If they also take those, it&#x27;s a conflict. But if they take magnets, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the shovel and 3 magnets. That&#x27;s 4 + 3*1 = 7. Then the other player could take the flower and 1 magnet, which is 2 +1=3. Total 10. That&#x27;s possible. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is different, like taking the shovel and flower, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as valuable as possible while minimizing the chance of conflict. The shovel is the most valuable, so I should definitely try to get that. The flower is next. So maybe propose the shovel and the flower. But if the other player also wants those, it&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the shovel and some magnets. Let&#x27;s say 1 shovel and 2 magnets. That&#x27;s 4 + 2 = 6. Then the other player could take the flower and 2 magnets. That&#x27;s 2 + 2 =4. Total 10. That&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the shovel and the flower, then my proposal would conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to take the shovel and the flower. However, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the same, we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, maybe they proposed taking 4 magnets and the shovel. Then my proposal would conflict. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But given that I have to make a proposal, I should go for the highest value items. So I&#x27;ll propose the shovel and the flower. That&#x27;s 4+2=6. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, that&#x27;s great. If not, maybe we both get zero. But it&#x27;s a risk. Alternatively, maybe take the shovel and some magnets. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s secret proposal is already made. Maybe I should check if their proposal is compatible. But since I can&#x27;t see it, I have to make my own. <br/><br/>Another thought: the other player might have proposed something that&#x27;s not conflicting. For example, if they took 3 magnets and the flower, then I can take the shovel and 1 magnet. That would be compatible. <br/><br/>But without knowing, I have to make a proposal. The safest way is to take the shovel and the flower. If that&#x27;s possible, it&#x27;s the best. If not, maybe adjust. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 flower]<br/></p>
