        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 vases, 1 chair, and 1 wire. My value function is vase:2, chair:3, wire:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary, meaning we can both get what we want without overlapping items.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what items I value the most. The chair is worth 3, which is the highest. Then vases at 2 each, and wire at 1. Since there are 3 vases, maybe I can take all of them, but I need to see if that&#x27;s possible. However, the other player might also want some items. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an assumption or try to maximize my own gain.<br/><br/>If I propose taking the chair and all three vases, that would be [Proposal: 1 chair, 3 vases]. But then the other player would need to propose something that doesn&#x27;t conflict. However, if I take all the vases and the chair, there&#x27;s only the wire left. The other player might want the wire, but if they propose taking the wire, then we can both get our items. But if I take the chair and vases, and they take the wire, that&#x27;s complementary. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the wire is higher than mine. Since I value the wire at 1, if they value it more, they might take it. But if I take the chair and vases, I get 3 + 3*2 = 9 points. The wire is 1, which I might not want to give up. Alternatively, maybe I should leave the wire for them if they value it more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the chair and one vase. Then the other player could take the remaining two vases and the wire. But I need to think about what&#x27;s best for me. If I take the chair and one vase, that&#x27;s 3 + 2 = 5. The other player could take two vases (4) and the wire (1), totaling 5. But if their value for the wire is higher, maybe they would prefer that. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the chair is the most valuable to me, I should definitely take it. Then, for the vases, maybe take two of them. That would be 3 (chair) + 2*2 = 7. Then the other player could take the remaining vase and the wire. If they value the wire more than me, they might take it. But if I take two vases, that&#x27;s 4, and the chair is 3. Alternatively, taking all three vases would be 6, plus the chair is 9. But if I take all three vases and the chair, that&#x27;s 9. The other player would have to take the wire. If they value the wire more than 1, they might take it. But if I take all the items except the wire, maybe that&#x27;s better. However, the problem is that if I take all the items, the other player can&#x27;t take anything, but if they propose something else, maybe they can get the wire. But if I take all the items, then their proposal would have to be empty, which might not be allowed. Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning they don&#x27;t overlap. So if I take all items, the other player can&#x27;t take anything, so their proposal would have to be empty. But maybe that&#x27;s allowed. However, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty, then it&#x27;s complementary. But maybe the other player would not propose anything, but the rules say that each player must submit a secret proposal. So if I take all items, the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be something that doesn&#x27;t conflict. But if they propose nothing, maybe that&#x27;s allowed. But I&#x27;m not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should leave some items for them to take, so that their proposal can be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the chair and one vase. Then the other player can take the remaining two vases and the wire. That way, both proposals are complementary. My total would be 3 + 2 = 5. The other player&#x27;s would be 2*2 +1 =5. But if their value for the wire is higher, they might prefer that. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe approach. Alternatively, if I take the chair and two vases, that&#x27;s 3 + 4 =7. Then the other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. That&#x27;s 2 +1=3. But if they value the wire more, they might take it. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to tell.<br/><br/>Another thought: since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to decide what to propose. The key is to maximize my own score. The chair is the most valuable, so I should definitely take it. Then, for the vases, maybe take two. That way, I get 3 + 2*2 =7. The other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. If they value the wire more than me, they might take it. But if I take two vases, that&#x27;s 4, and the chair is 3. Alternatively, taking all three vases would be 6, plus chair 3, total 9. But then the other player can only take the wire. If they value the wire more than 1, they might take it. But if I take all items except the wire, maybe that&#x27;s better. However, if I take all items, the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be empty. But maybe that&#x27;s allowed. However, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty, then it&#x27;s complementary. But maybe the other player would not propose anything, but the rules require each to submit a proposal. So if I take all items, the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be something that doesn&#x27;t conflict. But if they propose nothing, maybe that&#x27;s not allowed. The problem says &quot;submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want&quot;. So maybe they have to propose something. Therefore, if I take all items, the other player can&#x27;t propose anything, which would make their proposal invalid. Therefore, I need to leave some items for them to take.<br/><br/>So, the best approach is to take the chair and two vases. That leaves one vase and the wire for the other player. If they value the wire more than me, they can take it. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, this is a safe bet. Alternatively, take the chair and one vase, leaving two vases and the wire. But that might give me less. So taking the chair and two vases seems better. Let me check the numbers again. Chair is 3, two vases is 4, total 7. The other player can take one vase (2) and the wire (1), total 3. But if they value the wire more, maybe they would take it. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a possible proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the chair and the wire. That would be 3 +1=4. Then the other player can take the three vases. If they value vases more than me, they might take them. But I value vases at 2 each, so three vases would be 6. If they value them more, they might take them. But if I take the chair and wire, I get 4. But maybe that&#x27;s not optimal. The chair is more valuable, so taking it is better.<br/><br/>Another option: take the chair and all three vases. That&#x27;s 3 + 6 =9. Then the other player can take the wire. If they value the wire more than 1, they take it. But if I take all items except the wire, maybe that&#x27;s better. But if the other player&#x27;s value for the wire is higher, they might take it. However, since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a risk. But if I can get 9, that&#x27;s better than 7. So maybe that&#x27;s the better proposal. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. If I take all items except the wire, then the other player can take the wire. So their proposal would be [Proposal: 1 wire]. That&#x27;s complementary. So in that case, I get 9, they get 1. But if their value for the wire is higher, they might take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a possible strategy.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the chair and one vase. Then the other player can take two vases and the wire. That way, both proposals are complementary. My total is 3 + 2 =5. The other player&#x27;s is 4 +1=5. But if their value for the wire is higher, they might prefer that. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard to tell.<br/><br/>But since my goal is to maximize my own score, I should aim for the highest possible. So taking the chair and all three vases gives me 9. The other player can take the wire. If they value it more than 1, they take it. But if not, they might not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a possible proposal. However, if the other player&#x27;s value for the wire is higher, they might take it, but I still get 9. So that&#x27;s better than other options.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the chair and two vases. That&#x27;s 7. The other player can take one vase and the wire. If they value the wire more, they take it. But again, I don&#x27;t know. But 7 is better than 5. So maybe that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>But which is better? 9 vs 7. If I can get 9, that&#x27;s better. But is it possible? If I propose taking the chair and three vases, and the other player proposes taking the wire, then it&#x27;s complementary. So that&#x27;s allowed. So that&#x27;s a possible proposal.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player would not propose the wire. But since I have to make a secret proposal, I can&#x27;t know. So the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So chair and all vases. That&#x27;s 9. So I should make that proposal.<br/><br/>But wait, the problem says that the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I don&#x27;t know their values. But my goal is to maximize my own score. So I should propose the items I value the most, assuming that the other player might not want them. But if they do, then their proposal would conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain, even if it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the chair and two vases. That way, even if the other player takes the remaining vase and wire, I still get 7. But if I take all three vases and the chair, I get 9. So that&#x27;s better. So I should propose that.<br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 chair, 3 vases]. That&#x27;s the best I can do. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, I get 9. If not, we both get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make the best possible offer.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The items available are 3 vases, 1 chair, and 1 wire. My value function is vase:0, chair:8, wire:2. So I really want the chair and the wire, but the vases are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they&#x27;re trying to get certain items. My goal is to maximize my own score. Since the chair is worth 8 to me and the wire is 2, I should aim to get those. The vases are 0, so I don&#x27;t care about them.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs are complementary. If I take the chair and wire, that&#x27;s two items. The other player might have proposed some items. If their proposal includes items that I also want, there could be a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my value while possibly leaving some items for them to avoid conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s only me who knows it. The other player&#x27;s proposal is already secret. So when we both submit secret proposals, the system checks if they are complementary. So I need to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap in a way that causes both to get zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the chair and wire. Because those are the items I value. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we can both get them. But if their proposal includes, say, the chair, then we can&#x27;t both have it. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe the best approach is to propose the chair and wire. That way, if their proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get a high score. If it does, then maybe we both get zero, but that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the chair. Because the chair is worth 8, which is higher than the wire&#x27;s 2. But then I might miss out on the wire. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the chair, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get the chair and maybe the wire if they don&#x27;t take it. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is already secret. So I have to make my own proposal. The key is that if both proposals are complementary, meaning that the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items. So for example, if I propose chair and wire, and the other player proposes, say, 3 vases, then that&#x27;s complementary. Because the items are different. So I get chair and wire (total 10), they get 3 vases (which they might value, but I don&#x27;t know their value function). But since my value function is vase:0, I don&#x27;t care about that. But the other player&#x27;s value function is unknown. However, the goal is to maximize my own score.<br/><br/>So the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So chair and wire. That&#x27;s two items. The other player&#x27;s proposal could be anything. If their proposal is, say, chair and something else, then we can&#x27;t both have the chair. But if their proposal is vases, then we can both have their vases and my chair and wire. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make my own.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the chair. Because if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the chair, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get the chair. But then I might miss the wire. But the wire is worth 2. So maybe it&#x27;s better to take both. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the chair, then I lose both. But if they don&#x27;t, I get both. So the risk is higher, but the potential gain is higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. Let me think. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, for example, 3 vases, then we can both have them. So I get chair and wire (10), they get 3 vases (which they might value, but I don&#x27;t know). If their proposal is chair and something else, then we can&#x27;t both have the chair. But if their proposal is, say, wire and something else, then we can&#x27;t both have the wire. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my value.<br/><br/>So the best strategy is to propose the chair and the wire. Because those are the items I value. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then I get them. If it does, then we both get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the chair. But then I might miss the wire. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the chair, then I get nothing. But if they don&#x27;t, I get the chair. But the wire is 2, which is less than 8. So maybe it&#x27;s better to take both.<br/><br/>Another thought: the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but maybe they have a certain strategy. For example, if they proposed the chair, then I should not propose it. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal. So the safest way is to propose the items I value the most. So chair and wire. That&#x27;s my proposal.<br/></p>
