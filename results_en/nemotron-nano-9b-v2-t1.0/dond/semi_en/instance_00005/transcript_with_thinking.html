        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, and 1 battery. My value function is dice:1, ball:7, glue:0, battery:1. So the ball is super valuable to me, and the dice and battery are less so. Glue is worthless.<br/><br/>The goal is to maximize my score. Since the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, I have to make assumptions or try to get information through messages. But I can only send up to 5 messages each, or make a secret proposal at any time.<br/><br/>First, I should probably start by sending a message to the other player to get some information about their preferences. Maybe ask them what they value most. But how to phrase that without using square brackets? The messages are direct, so I need to be concise.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal, messages are transmitted directly. So I can send regular messages to the other player. Let me think. Maybe I can ask them, &quot;What do you value most?&quot; or &quot;What items are you interested in?&quot; But I need to make sure not to use square brackets in regular messages.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose a split. Since I value the ball highly, I might want to take the ball. But if the other player also values the ball, there could be a conflict. So maybe I should propose taking the ball and some other items, and see if they can accept.<br/><br/>But the problem is that if both proposals are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don&#x27;t overlap on items. So if I take the ball, they can&#x27;t take it. But if I don&#x27;t take the ball, maybe they will, and I might get nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer to take the ball and some other items, and see if they can take the rest. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Another approach: since I can make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should just make a proposal that maximizes my value. For example, take the ball and the battery. That gives me 7 + 1 = 8. The other items (dice and glue) would be left for the other player. But if they also want the battery, that could be a problem. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the ball and the dice. But the dice are only worth 1 each. So 7 + 1 = 8. Same as before. Or take the ball and glue, but glue is 0. So that&#x27;s 7. Not as good.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the ball, the other player might not want it. But if they do, then my proposal would conflict. So maybe I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can send a message to the other player to find out their preferences. For example, &quot;What items do you value the most?&quot; But I need to make sure that my messages are not secret proposals. So I can send regular messages.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player might not respond, or their response might not be helpful. But since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can try to get some info.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just make a secret proposal. Since I can do that at any time. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, I can propose taking the ball and the battery. That&#x27;s 8 points. The other player would get the dice and glue. If their value function is such that they don&#x27;t want the ball, then this would work. But if they do want the ball, then our proposals would conflict, and we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the ball and the dice. That&#x27;s 7 + 1 = 8. Same as before. Or maybe take the ball and glue, but that&#x27;s 7. Not as good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the ball and the battery, and the other player can take the dice and glue. If their value function is such that they don&#x27;t care about the battery, then this would work. But if they do, then conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that maximizes my value. So I&#x27;ll go with the ball and battery. That&#x27;s 8. Let me check the items: 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, 1 battery. If I take the ball and battery, that&#x27;s two items. The other player would get the two dice and glue. But if they also want the battery, then conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the ball and the dice. That&#x27;s 7 + 1 = 8. Same as before. Or maybe take the ball and glue, but that&#x27;s 7. So the best is ball and battery.<br/><br/>So I think I should make a secret proposal with the ball and battery. Let me format that as per the rules: &quot;[Proposal: 1 ball, 1 battery]&quot;. That should be my secret proposal. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, we both get our scores. If not, zero. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. My value function is dice:0, ball:2, glue:8, battery:0. So I really want the glue, and the ball is okay but not as much. The dice and battery are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they&#x27;re trying to get certain items. Since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, I need to make my own that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then both get their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that don&#x27;t conflict with theirs. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s secret proposal is something I can infer. For example, if they proposed items that I don&#x27;t value, maybe I can take those. Alternatively, maybe they proposed items I do value, so I need to avoid those. But without knowing their proposal, how can I decide?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, hoping that the other player didn&#x27;t propose them. Since I value glue the most (8), then ball (2), and the rest are 0. So I should propose glue and maybe ball. But if the other player also proposed glue, then we both get zero. So maybe I should propose glue and something else that&#x27;s less likely to be in their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can counter. But since I can&#x27;t see it, perhaps the best strategy is to propose the items I value most, and hope that the other player didn&#x27;t take them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that I don&#x27;t value, but that&#x27;s not helpful.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I have to make my own proposal without knowing theirs. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. Maybe propose items that are not in high demand. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is challenging.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so I should just propose my most valuable items. Let me think. If I propose glue and ball, and if the other player didn&#x27;t propose those, then I get both. But if they did, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe propose glue and something else. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t interfere with. For example, if they proposed dice and battery, which I don&#x27;t value, then I can take those. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary. But how? Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are not in their proposal. But how can I know that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value most, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is different, then we both get them. If not, we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should just propose glue and ball. Let me check the items again: 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, 1 battery. So there are two dice, but only one ball, one glue, one battery.<br/><br/>If I propose glue and ball, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, dice and battery, then we can both get our items. But if the other player also proposed glue, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose glue and ball. Alternatively, maybe propose glue and something else. But the ball is worth 2, which is better than nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose glue and battery. But battery is worth 0 to me. But if the other player didn&#x27;t take battery, then I can get it. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose just glue. Since it&#x27;s the most valuable. If the other player didn&#x27;t take it, then I get 8. If they did, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than proposing multiple items. But the problem says that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose glue, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, ball and dice, then we can both get our items. But if the other player also proposed glue, then we can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose glue. Because if they didn&#x27;t take it, I get 8. If they did, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe propose glue and ball. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know. So perhaps the best is to propose the items I value most. So glue and ball. Let me go with that. So my proposal would be [Proposal: glue, ball]. But I need to format it as numbers. Wait, the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So I need to assign numbers to the items. Wait, the items are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, 1 battery. So maybe the numbers are the quantities? Or maybe the numbers are just identifiers. Wait, the example in the rules says &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So maybe the numbers are just part of the format, but the actual items are the names. So for example, if I want to propose 1 glue and 1 ball, I would write [Proposal: 1 glue, 1 ball]. But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I need to make my own.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. So if I propose glue and ball, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, dice and battery, then we can both get our items. But if their proposal includes glue or ball, then we can&#x27;t. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the items I value most. So glue and ball. Alternatively, maybe just glue. Because if I propose glue, and the other player didn&#x27;t, then I get 8. If they did, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than proposing multiple items. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t interfere with. For example, if they proposed dice and battery, which I don&#x27;t value, then I can take those. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value most, which are glue and ball. So I&#x27;ll go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 glue, 1 ball]. But I need to check the format. The example shows numbers followed by object names. So maybe the numbers are the quantities. Since there&#x27;s 1 ball and 1 glue, that&#x27;s correct. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 glue, 1 ball]. That&#x27;s my best bet.<br/></p>
