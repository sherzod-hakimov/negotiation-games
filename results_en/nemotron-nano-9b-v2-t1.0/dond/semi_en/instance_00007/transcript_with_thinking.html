    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, and 2 cups. My value function is wire:1, glass:0, needle:0, cup:4. So I really value cups a lot, and wires a little. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary to theirs.<br/><br/>The goal is to maximize my score. Since cups are worth 4 each, I should try to get as many cups as possible. But I can only propose up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is the final offer, so I need to decide when to lock in my proposal.<br/><br/>First, I should probably start by communicating my preferences. Since I value cups highly, maybe I should ask for cups. But how? The messages are sent to the other player, so I need to propose items in a way that they might accept. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they also value cups, or maybe they don&#x27;t. If they don&#x27;t, then I should take the cups for myself.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking both cups. But if the other player also wants cups, then we might not have enough. Wait, there are 2 cups. If I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take any. But if they also want both, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose taking one cup, leaving one for them. But if they don&#x27;t value cups, they might not take it. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and some wires. Since wires are worth 1 each, but cups are worth 4. So if I can get both cups, that&#x27;s 8 points. If I can&#x27;t, maybe I can get one cup and some wires. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose taking both cups. If they also want both, then we can&#x27;t both get them, so we might have to split. But if they don&#x27;t want cups, then they might accept my proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one cup and some wires, but that might not be optimal.<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should make a secret proposal early. But the rules say I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should start by sending messages to the other player to gauge their preferences. But since I can&#x27;t see their messages, I have to make assumptions.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just make a secret proposal immediately. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, I can propose items that I want. For example, I could propose taking both cups and maybe some wires. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is not complementary, then we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal is something that the other player might accept.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest bet is to propose items that I value highly. So cups. Let me try to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So I could propose [Proposal: 2 cups, 1 wire]. That would give me 2*4 + 1*1 = 9 points. But if the other player also wants cups, they might not accept. Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 cups and 2 wires. But that&#x27;s 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. But if the other player also wants those, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 cups and 0 wires. That&#x27;s 8 points. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want cups, they might accept. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t both have them. So maybe I should propose 1 cup and 2 wires. That&#x27;s 4 + 2 = 6. But that&#x27;s less than 8. So maybe 2 cups is better.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. If I propose 2 cups, and they propose 2 cups, then we can&#x27;t both have them. So maybe I should propose 1 cup and 1 wire. That&#x27;s 4 + 1 = 5. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should not make a secret proposal yet and instead send messages to the other player. For example, I could ask them if they want cups. But the messages are direct, so I need to phrase it as a proposal. Wait, the messages are for agreeing on the division. So maybe I can send a message like &quot;I want 2 cups and 1 wire. What do you want?&quot; But the exact format isn&#x27;t specified, but the secret proposal is in the specific format.<br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s instruction says that unless it&#x27;s the secret proposal, messages are directly transmitted. So I need to send messages that are proposals or questions. But the exact content isn&#x27;t specified. However, the key is that the secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should start by sending a message to the other player, proposing my desired items, and then see if they accept.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t actually see their responses, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Given that I value cups highly, I should propose taking both cups. If the other player also wants them, then we might have a conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I can get both. Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 cups and 0 other items. That way, if they don&#x27;t want cups, they can take other items. But if they do want cups, then we have a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 1 cup and 2 wires. That way, even if they want cups, they can take the other cup. But I&#x27;m not sure. This is a bit of a gamble.<br/><br/>Another approach: since I value cups the most, I should try to secure as many as possible. So I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal for 2 cups. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include cups, then I get both. If they do, then we have to split. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose 2 cups and see. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then I get 8 points. If not, zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 cups and 2 wires. That&#x27;s 10 points. But if the other player also wants those, then we can&#x27;t both have them. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 10. But again, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 cups and 1 wire. That&#x27;s 9 points. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want cups, they can take the wire. But if they do, then we have a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose 2 cups. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 cups]. That&#x27;s 8 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then I get 8. If not, zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do given the information.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. The items available are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, 2 cups. My values are wire:1, glass:2, needle:2, cup:0. So I value glasses and needles the most.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I should consider possible scenarios. Wait, but in the problem setup, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I can&#x27;t see it. Hmm, but the user is telling me that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So I need to make my own secret proposal.<br/><br/>But how do I decide what to propose? Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, hoping that they might accept or that their proposal complements mine. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, that&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if I propose 2 glasses and 2 needles, that&#x27;s 4 items. But there are 2 glasses and 2 needles available. So if they propose something else, maybe it&#x27;s possible. But if they also propose glasses or needles, then it might not be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. For example, if I propose 2 wires and 2 cups. Since cups are worthless to me, but maybe they value them. But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a mix of high and low value items.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value the most, so that even if they propose something else, there&#x27;s a chance that the combination is possible. For example, if I propose 2 glasses and 2 needles, that&#x27;s 4 items. The total available is 2 glasses, 2 needles, etc. So if they propose, say, 2 wires and 2 cups, then together we have 2 glasses, 2 needles, 2 wires, 2 cups. That&#x27;s all items, so it&#x27;s complementary. Then I get 2*2 (glasses) + 2*2 (needles) = 8 points. That&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>But if they propose something that overlaps, like 2 glasses and 2 needles, then we can&#x27;t both have them. So my proposal would conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a guess. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a smaller set. For example, 1 glass and 1 needle. But that might not be enough. Or maybe propose 2 glasses and 1 needle. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not overlapping. For example, if I propose 2 wires and 2 cups, and they propose 2 glasses and 2 needles, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe not. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is as good as possible, even if it&#x27;s risky. For example, 2 glasses and 2 needles. If their proposal is compatible, I get a good score. If not, zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is more likely to be complementary. For example, if I propose 2 wires and 2 cups, and they propose 2 glasses and 2 needles, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, like 2 glasses and 2 wires, then it&#x27;s not. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal. So maybe I need to make my own secret proposal now. The key is that my proposal and theirs must be complementary. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t take those. For example, if I propose 2 glasses and 2 needles, that&#x27;s 4 items. If their proposal is 2 wires and 2 cups, then it&#x27;s okay. But if their proposal is 2 glasses and 2 needles, then it&#x27;s not. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should proceed with that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is more flexible. For example, 1 glass, 1 needle, 1 wire, 1 cup. But that&#x27;s 4 items. But maybe that&#x27;s too spread out. However, if their proposal is similar, it might not be complementary. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is as good as possible, even if it&#x27;s risky. So 2 glasses and 2 needles. That&#x27;s 4 items. If their proposal is 2 wires and 2 cups, then it&#x27;s okay. If their proposal is 2 glasses and 2 needles, then it&#x27;s not. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that is less likely to conflict. For example, 2 wires and 2 cups. Since cups are worthless to me, but maybe they value them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that includes items that are less likely to be taken by the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s impossible.<br/><br/>Hmm. Since I have to make a secret proposal, and I don&#x27;t know theirs, the best I can do is to propose items that I value the most. So 2 glasses and 2 needles. That&#x27;s 4 items. If their proposal is 2 wires and 2 cups, then it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal is 2 glasses and 2 needles, then it&#x27;s not. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 glasses and 1 needle, but that&#x27;s 3 items. But then maybe they can take the remaining 1 needle and 2 wires and 2 cups. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 glasses and 2 needles. Let me go with that. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 glass, 2 needle]. That&#x27;s the format. Let me check the rules. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So yes, that&#x27;s correct. So I should send that as my secret proposal.<br/></p>
