    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg a-gm" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I will compute a high-value subset under effort limit 4564. Items with highest value/effort ratio and absolute importance: C42(808/107=7.55), C10(780/501=1.56), A43(868/889=0.98), C61(668/565=1.18), A67(822/967=0.85), B42(783/619=1.26), C55(583/241=2.42), B36(461/139=3.32), A18(484/594=0.81), C73(508/909=0.56), C67(389/789=0.49), C08(138/299=0.46), A62(65/799=0.08), B19(262/978=0.27), C43(121/733=0.17). Greedy by ratio suggests definitely include C42, B36, C55, C10, B42, C61. Check effort: 107+139+241+501+619+565=2172, value 808+461+583+780+783+668=4083. We have lots of room. Add A43 (eff 889, val 868): effort 3061, val 4951. Add A67 (967, 822): effort 4028, val 5773. Remaining capacity 536. Consider A18 (594 too big), C73 (909), C67 (789), C08 (299, 138) fits: add C08 -&gt; effort 4327, val 5911. Remaining 237, no other items fit except none (C55 already added). Could swap C08 out to fit something better: remaining 536 suggests no other high-value small items exist. Try alternative: what if instead of C08 (138,299), can we include something like B36 already in, C42 already in. Only small efforts: C55(241 already), B36(139 already), C10(501 already), C42(107 already). Maybe we can try adding A18 by removing something: to add A18 (594) we need +58 effort if from 4028 base (without C08) to 4622 which exceeds. We&#x27;d need to remove an item of at least 88 effort in addition to not adding C08; but we already without C08 at 4028, adding A18 would be 4622 which exceeds limit by 58, so we&#x27;d need to remove at least 58 effort from existing set: smallest to remove is C42(107) but C42 is very valuable, not worth trade. Try alternative: remove C10(501) to add A18(594) =&gt; +93 effort, worse. Remove B36(139) to add A18 =&gt; +455 effort, exceeds. So current set seems near-optimal. Try adding C73 by swaps: C73(909,508). If we drop A43(889,868) and C08(299,138) we free 1188 effort to add C73 909 and maybe C67 none; value would drop: remove 1006 value to add 508, net worse. Try swapping A67(967,822) for A18(594,484)+C08(299,138)=eff 893, value 622, still worse than 822. So best set I found: {C42, B36, C55, C10, B42, C61, A43, A67, C08} with effort 4327 and value 5911. I will propose this strong package and argue it balances effort with many medium items, inviting them to suggest swaps if they have strong preferences. I will keep some flexibility by noting we’re under limit allowing room to accommodate a small extra if they have one under 237, though none exists; but I can offer to swap C08 if they want a different small item.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;, &#x27;C55&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;B42&#x27;, &#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;A67&#x27;, &#x27;C08&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This selection stays well under the effort limit while covering a balanced mix of items. It secures several compact, high-effort-efficiency items plus a couple of bigger ones to make the most of our capacity. If you have a small-priority item under ~237 effort you want included, we can discuss swapping C08 to accommodate it.&#x27;}</p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Compute my utility and feasibility. Opponent proposed: {C42, B36, C55, C10, B42, C61, A43, A67, C08}. Efforts: C42 107, B36 139, C55 241, C10 501, B42 619, C61 565, A43 889, A67 967, C08 299. Total effort = 4327 (&lt;=4564). My importance sum: C42 808 + B36 461 + C55 583 + C10 780 + B42 783 + C61 668 + A43 868 + A67 822 + C08 138 = 5911. Check if I can improve within limit by adding more: remaining capacity 4564-4327=237. Items not included: A62(799,65), B19(978,262), C43(733,121), C73(909,508), A18(594,484), C67(789,389), C10 included, others included. None have effort &lt;=237, so cannot add. Consider swaps to increase my total importance while staying within limit. Candidate to remove: C08 (effort 299, value 138) is low value density; opponent even suggested swapping C08 for &lt;=237 effort item—none exist, but we could swap C08 for A18 (594,484): new effort 4327 - 299 + 594 = 4622 &gt; 4564 (too high). Swap C08 for C67 (789,389): 4327 - 299 + 789 = 4817 &gt; limit. Swap C08 for C73 (909,508): 4937 &gt; limit. Swap C08 for C43 (733,121): effort 4761 &gt; limit and also lower value. Swap C08 for A62 (799,65): worse. Swap C08 for B19 (978,262): 5006 &gt; limit. Try removing another low value with C08 to add a high one. Identify lowest value items currently in set by my importance: C08 138, C43 not in set, next lowest maybe B36 461 (actually 461 is mid), C55 583, C10 780, B42 783, C61 668, A43 868, A67 822, C42 808. Lowest are C08 138 and B36 461. If I drop C08 (299) + B36 (139)=438 freed. Could I add A18 (594,484)? 4327 - 438 + 594 = 4483 &lt;= limit, value change: -138 -461 +484 = -115 (worse). What about C73 (909,508)? Effort 4327 - 438 + 909 = 4798 &gt; limit. C67 (789,389): 4678 &gt;. C43 (733,121) not worth it. A62 (799,65) no. B19 (978,262) &gt;. So no beneficial swap with two items unless dropping a higher effort but lower marginal value density. Consider dropping C08 (299,138) and C55 (241,583) to add C73 (909,508): Effort 4327 - 540 + 909 = 4696 &gt;. Drop C08 and C61 (565,668) to add C73: 4327 - 864 + 909 = 4372 (ok). Value change: -138 -668 +508 = -298 (worse). Drop C08 and C10 (501,780) to add C73: effort 4327 - 800 + 909 = 4436 ok; value change: -138 -780 +508 = -410 (worse). Drop C08 and B42 (619,783) for C73: effort 4327 - 918 + 909 = 4318 ok; value change: -138 -783 +508 = -413 (worse). Drop C08 and A67 (967,822) for C73 plus maybe something small? First swap: 4327 - 1266 + 909 = 3970; value change: -138 -822 +508 = -452 (worse). Try adding A18 too: 3970 + 594 = 4564 exactly; value change then: previous -452 +484 = +32 improvement. New set would be: replace {A67, C08} with {C73, A18}. Check effort: original 4327 - (967+299)=3061; add 909+594=1503; total 4564 (exact limit). Value: original 5911 - (822+138)=4951; + (508+484)=5943; gain +32 vs their proposal. That’s better for me. Are there any better combos? Try replacing {B42 619, C08 299} with {C73 909, A18 594}: Effort 4327 - 918 + 1503 = 4912 &gt;. Replace {C61 565, C08 299} with {C73 909, A18 594}: 4327 - 864 + 1503 = 4966 &gt;. Replace {A43 889, C08 299} with {C73 909, A18 594}: 4327 - 1188 + 1503 = 4642 &gt;. Replace {C10 501, C08 299} with {C73 909, A18 594}: 4327 - 800 + 1503 = 5030 &gt;. Replace {C42 107, C08 299} with {C73 909, A18 594}: 4327 - 406 + 1503 = 5424 &gt;. Try {A67 967, B36 139} -&gt; {C73 909, A18 594}: Effort 4327 -1106 +1503 = 4724 &gt;. Try {A67 967, C55 241} -&gt; {C73 909, A18 594}: 4327 -1208 +1503 = 4622 &gt;. Try {A67 967, C61 565} -&gt; {C73 909, A18 594}: 4327 -1532 +1503 = 4298; value change: -822 -668 +508 +484 = -498 (worse). Try {A67 967, C10 501} -&gt; add {C73 909, A18 594}: effort 4327 -1468 +1503 = 4362; value change: -822 -780 +508 +484 = -610 (worse). Try swapping A62 anywhere? It&#x27;s low value, but not in set. Try adding A18 alone by dropping C08 and something small: Need +594 - 299 = +295 extra capacity; must drop at least 295 effort. Candidates: C42 107 (too small), B36 139 (total 246, still short), C55 241 (total 540 &gt;295; dropping C08+C55 frees 540; new effort 4327 - 540 + 594 = 4381 within; value change: -138 -583 +484 = -237 (worse)). Try add C67 by dropping C08 + something: need +789 -299=+490; dropping B36 gives 299+139=438 still short; add C42 107 gives 545; effort ok: new effort 4327 - (299+139+107) + 789 = 497... wait compute: 4327 - 545 + 789 = 4571 &gt; limit by 7; so we’d need to drop a bit more (e.g., +241 C55: 4327 - 786 + 789 = 4330; value change: -138 -461 -808 -583 + 389 = -1601 (terrible)). So best found is replacing {A67, C08} with {C73, A18} yielding +32 value and full use of capacity. Could there be better with {A67} replaced by {C73} plus some small tweak not involving A18? After removing A67 (967), adding C73 (909) leaves -58 effort difference; we could then add nothing else with efforts &lt;=58 (none). If also drop C08 (299) we have 967+299-909=357 extra capacity to fill; A18 is 594 fits to exactly limit as we computed. Any other pair fit 357? None under or equal, smallest remaining efforts: C42 107 (already in set), B36 139 (in set), C55 241 (in set), but we are looking to add from excluded set: A62 799, B19 978, C43 733, C73 909, A18 594, C67 789—all exceed 357 except A18 which is 594 but we accounted the difference wrong; we’re adding A18 too so total add 909+594=1503, drop 1266, net +237 which exactly matches remaining capacity (4564-4327=237), consistent. Any other alternative: replace {A67, C08} with {C73, C67}? Add 909+789=1698; drop 1266; net +432 effort -&gt; 4327+432=4759 &gt;. Replace {A67, C08} with {A18, C67}? 594+789=1383; net +117 -&gt; 4444 effort; value change: -822 -138 +484 +389 = -87 (worse). Replace {A67, B36} with {C73, A18}? Drop 1106; add 1503; net +397 -&gt; 4724 &gt;. So the best improvement is the {A67, C08} -&gt; {C73, A18} swap. I will refuse their proposal and propose my improved set. Provide an argument highlighting staying within limit and better balance, referencing their willingness to swap C08. Avoid revealing my valuations. I’ll present it as maintaining efficiency while using full capacity. Include ARGUMENT tag.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Opponent refused and countered with {C42, B36, C55, C10, B42, C61, A43, C73, A18}. Compute efforts: 107+139+241+501+619+565+889+909+594 = 4564, fits exactly. Compute my importance: C42 808 + B36 461 + C55 583 + C10 780 + B42 783 + C61 668 + A43 868 + C73 508 + A18 484 = 5943. My previous proposal value was 5911, effort 4327. Their set is slightly better for me (+32 value) and uses capacity fully. Check if any improvement possible within limit: consider replacing C73(909,508) with A67(967,822) -&gt; effort +58 exceeds. Replace A18(594,484) with A67 -&gt; +373 exceeds. Replace C73 with C08(299,138) plus A67? Current effort 4564 - 909 + 299 + 967 = 4921 exceeds. Replace A18 with C08 and A67: 4564 - 594 + 299 + 967 = 5236 exceeds. Maybe swap C73 for A18? Already both included. Try swap C10(501,780) with A67(967,822): +466 exceeds. Any alternate swaps that keep under 4564 and increase value? Low-effort candidates: none left except removing something to fit A67 seems impossible without dropping high-value efficiency items like C42 or B36 which would reduce value. So opponent’s proposal seems near-optimal for me. Best action: accept immediately to secure high payoff and end negotiation.&#x27;}<br/><br/>AGREE: {&#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;, &#x27;C55&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;B42&#x27;, &#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;C73&#x27;, &#x27;A18&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;Your revision works well for me and fully utilizes the limit while keeping all the compact, high-impact items.
