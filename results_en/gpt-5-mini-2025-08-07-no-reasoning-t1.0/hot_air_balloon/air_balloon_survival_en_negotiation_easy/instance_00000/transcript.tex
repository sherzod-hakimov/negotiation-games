Likely include high value density: C42, A67, A43, B42, C61, B36, A18, C73, C10. Let’s build a strong set and check effort sum: Start with C42(117)=117, A67(219)=336, A43(552)=888, B42(275)=1163, C61(347)=1510, B36(262)=1772, A18(377)=2149, C73(519)=2668, C10(862) would push to 3530>3358 so exclude. Try C55(933) too big. Add C67(349)=3017, remaining 341. Add B19(341)=3358 exactly perfect capacity. Total importance: C42 808 + A67 822 + A43 868 + B42 783 + C61 668 + B36 461 + A18 484 + C73 508 + C67 389 + B19 262 = 6053. That seems very high. Check efforts sum: 117+219+552+275+347+262+377+519+349+341=3358 exact. This is optimal by capacity fill; may be near{-}optimal importance. Propose that. If they resist, we can swap lower{-}importance items (B19, C67) for something they want like C55 or C10 but those are heavy; we’d have to drop multiple. Argue efficiency (exact fit, balanced mix). We include many items, giving counterpart room to see their preferences. We will anchor strong. We must include ARGUMENT. We'll not reveal values. We'll be ready to negotiate substitutions keeping limit.'\}} \\

Opponent proposes: \{C42,A67,A43,B42,C61,B36,A18,C73,C67,B19\}. Efforts: 117+219+552+275+347+262+377+519+349+341 = 3358, exactly at limit. My total importance of their set: 808+822+868+783+668+461+484+508+389+262 = 6053, which seems extremely strong, containing almost all my top items except C10 (780) and C55 (583). Which items not included: C08 (138), C55 (583), A62 (65), C43 (121), C10 (780), C10 is high. To fit C10 (862 effort) we'd have to remove items summing at least 862 effort, and we must consider importance tradeoffs. Candidates to drop: low{-}importance{-}for{-}me items: B19 (262, 262 imp), C67 (349, 389 imp), C73 (519, 508 imp), A18 (377, 484 imp), B36 (262, 461 imp). To include C10, need free 862; best to drop lower combined importance with equal or more effort. For example drop B19 (262,262) + C67 (349,389) + B36 (262,461) totals 873 effort, importance lost 1112; we'd gain 780, net {-}332 importance, so worse. Maybe drop C73 (519,508) + B19 (262,262) = 781 effort, still short; add C42? But C42 is 117 effort (and high 808 imp), then we'd exceed. Try C73 (519,508) + A18 (377,484) = 896 effort lost 992 importance; gain 780, net {-}212. Try C73 + C67 = 868 effort lost 897 importance; gain 780, net {-}117. Try B36 (262,461) + A18 (377,484) + B19 (262,262) = 901 lost 1207; net {-}427. Seems any inclusion of C10 worsens my score. What about swapping in C55 (933 effort, 583 imp)? That's too large; would need to drop huge importance and be worse. Current proposal looks near{-}optimal for me. Thus I should accept quickly, but per rules I can AGREE only to an active proposal. It's active. I must include ARGUMENT once. I will AGREE to their set and include a brief positive argument.'\}} \\
