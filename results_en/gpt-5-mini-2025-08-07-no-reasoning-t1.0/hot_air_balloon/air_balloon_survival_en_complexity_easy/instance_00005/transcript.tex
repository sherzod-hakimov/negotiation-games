Start with ultra{-}efficient: B85, C15, B60, B12, A27, C12, A08, A16, B09, C81, A30, C70, B46, B00, C34, B45, B67, B94, A66 as capacity allows. Calculate cumulative effort and importance to fit under 9475 while keeping high marginal value. Leave flexibility to swap a couple items if opponent objects. Make an initial comprehensive proposal slightly under limit to anchor. Sum chosen: Items = \{B85(17), C15(46), B60(101), B12(192), A27(239), C12(279), C81(404), C34(409), B53 is low importance so skip, A08(515), A16(573), B09(501), A30(552), B46(345), B00(568), B45(432), B67(678), C70(930), B94(876), C35(465)\}.

This is very strong and still leaves 1353 effort headroom. Consider adding A66(843,822 importance) → effort 8965, importance 14287. Add A05(506,389) would push to 9471 within limit, importance 14676. That exactly fits under 9475 with 9471 effort. Check if any higher value left: A84(854,500) too big after A66? Current 8965; adding A84 would be 9819 > limit. A58(843,457) would be 9808 > limit. C92(686,215) would be 9651 > limit. B75(947,235) would be 9912 > limit. B21(944,138) not worth. B10(772,623) cannot after 8965? 9737 > limit. C24(748,273) would be 9713 > limit. C65(281,121) could add after 9471? 9471+281=9752 > limit. So the best fill is A05(506,389) to hit 9471.

Argue with efficiency and fairness, highlighting that many chosen items are low effort and deliver broad coverage. Keep openness to swap a couple near{-}marginal items (e.g., C35, B45, C34) if needed to include their priorities. Also emphasize large remaining value packed under limit.'\}} \\

A66 included, A27 included, A16 included, A08 included, B12 included, B60 included, C15 included, B09 included, B67 included, C81 included, A30 included, B94 included. Remaining high ones: B10(623) moderate; B21(138) low; A84(500) moderate; A89(508) moderate; A58(457) moderate; C92(215) low. Efforts for possible adds: B10(772), A84(854), A89(788), A58(843), C92(686). To add anything, we’d need to drop comparable effort. Candidates to drop: maybe C35(465), B45(432), C34(409), A05(506). If I swap in B10(772) for, say, C35(465) + B45(432) (total 897), we’d free 125 effort; we could keep more, but we must meet limit; actually we’d reduce effort; importance change: add 623, remove 444+461=905, net {-}282, so worse. Try add A89(788) replacing A05(506)+C34(409)=915 effort; importance +508 {-} (389+484=873) = {-}365, worse. Add A84(854) replacing A05(506)+C35(465)=971 effort; importance +500 {-} (389+444=833) = {-}333, worse. Add A58(843) replace A05(506)+C34(409)=915; +457 {-} 873 = {-}416, worse. Add C92(686) replace A05(506)=686? Need equal or less effort; replacing A05 alone increases effort by 180, pushing us over; we’d need to also drop something else; importance +215 {-} (389+something) will be worse.
