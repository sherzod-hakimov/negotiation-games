You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."

Under limit. Maybe can swap C34(484,834) for something better like C12 already in; remaining capacity 60 cannot add anything meaningful except C06(124) too big. Could we replace a lower density item C34 with B21(935,138) not fit capacity (+101) would exceed. Replace C34 with A05(593,389) reduces effort by 241, importance -95, then we could add B75(172,235) and C24(275,273) maybe; let's check if worthwhile: If remove C34 (effort -834, importance -484): capacity becomes 9552-834=8718, freeing 894. Could add A05(593,389) + B75(172,235) + C24(275,273) total effort 1040 exceeds freed 834; but since we had 60 spare, freed 894; 593+172+275=1040 >894 so not fit. Try A05+B75=765 fits; new effort 9552 -834 +593 +172 = 9483, within limit; importance change: -484 +389 +235 = +140 net gain to 13838. Good. Could also consider C24(275,273) swapping with something else: We still have 129 room (9612-9483=129). Only items with effort <=129: C06(124,30) adds low importance 30; could add it to use capacity to 9607. Net +30 => 13868. Also consider replacing C35(577,444) with A05(593,389) would be -55 importance worse. So our improved set: original minus C34 plus A05 and B75 and add C06. Final set items: {A30,B69,A16,A27,B60,B45,A58,C70,B09,C15,B67,A08,A66,C81,B10,C12,B12,B46,C35,A05,B75,C06}. Compute effort: start 9552 -834 +593 +172 +124 = 9607 <= 9612. Importance: previous 13698 -484 +389 +235 +30 = 13868. Looks strong. I will propose this. Argue on efficiency and room.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.\n\nYou will now receive the first message of the other player.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A30', 'B69', 'A16', 'A27', 'B60', 'B45', 'A58', 'C70', 'B09', 'C15', 'B67', 'A08', 'A66', 'C81', 'B10', 'C12', 'B12', 'B46', 'C35', 'A05', 'B75', 'C06'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'This set stays within the limit (total effort 9607 ≤ 9612) and focuses on high-impact items with excellent effort-to-benefit tradeoffs (e.g., A30, A16, A27, B60, C70).

Total my value 13868. Effort they said 9607, within limit. Can I improve by adding B94(783,839) or B00(583,928) by swapping low-value items? We’re at 9607/9612, only 5 effort slack. To add anything we must remove others. Consider removing lowest-importance, high effort: B69 importance 97 effort 4 is great, keep. C06 30/124 great. B75 235/172 good. Maybe drop C35 444/577, A05 389/593, B45 461/138 is very efficient keep. Candidates to drop: C12 668/734 moderate, C81 713/629 good, B46 606/688 moderate, C35 444/577, A05 389/593. If we drop C35(577) we free 577; we could add B94(839) effort 839 net +262 effort, need remove additional 262. Maybe swap C35(444,577)+A05(389,593)= value 833, effort 1170. Replace with B94(783,839)+B00(583,928)= value 1366, effort 1767, too high. What about replace C35(444,577)+A05(389,593)+B75(235,172)=1068 value, effort 1342 with B94(783,839)+A23(262,394)=1045 value, effort 1233, slightly less value. Maybe bring A84(500,735) replacing A05(389,593): +111 value, +142 effort, need free 142 elsewhere by dropping B69? No B69 is only 4. Could drop C06(30,124): -30 value, -124 effort still short 18. Not good. What about replace C35(444,577) with A84(500,735): +56 value, +158 effort; could offset by swapping B75(235,172) to C24(273,275): +38 value, +103 effort, still need -? Actually effort increases. We need reduce effort, not increase, since we’re near limit. So any improvement should keep equal or less effort. Look for higher value per effort but lower or equal effort substitutes: Replace A05(389,593) with C24(273,275): value -116 but effort -318; with freed 318, we could add B94(783,839) if we also drop something 521 more; not good. Replace C35(444,577) with C24(273,275): value -171, effort -302; maybe use freed 302 to add A84(500,735)? Need 433 more effort, not feasible. What about swapping C35(444,577) with B21(138,935) no. A89(508,946) no. B85(400,782) worse effort. C34(484,834) larger effort. So current set may already be near-optimal for me given limit. Maybe propose minor tweak: drop C35(444,577) and A05(389,593) total value 833, effort 1170; add B94(783,839) and A30 already included, maybe add A23(262,394) and C24(273,275): added value 1318, effort 1508 >1170, too high. Try add B00(583,928) and C24(273,275): value 856, effort 1203 >1170 by 33, but we had 5 slack, still 28 over; could drop C06(30,124) too: new value 826 vs removed 863? Wait compute: remove A05(389,593)+C35(444,577)+C06(30,124)= value removed 863, effort 1294. Add B00(583,928)+C24(273,275)= value 856, effort 1203; net value -7, effort -91; with slack we could then add B75(235,172) but it's already included; maybe add C65(121,677) not enough effort. With 91 freed + existing 5 = 96 available, can't add any item except B69 already included, A30 included, A27 etc. B75 already included. A16 etc. Cheapest new not included: B60 included, B45 included, A58 included, B67 included, B10 included. The cheapest remaining not included efforts: B69(4) included; A30(39) included; C06(124) removed in this scenario; B75(172) included; A27 included; A16 included; A58 included; B60 included; C24(275) added; B10 included; A23(394) maybe add with 96 slack no. So not helpful. Conclusion: Accept their proposal is good. I’ll agree quickly to secure high value. Ensure to include ARGUMENT and AGREE only if it's their proposal, which it is.
