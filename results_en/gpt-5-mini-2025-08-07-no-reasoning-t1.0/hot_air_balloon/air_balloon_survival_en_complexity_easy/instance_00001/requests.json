The best additional per my value if we can fit: C92 value 215 with low effort 201 is appealing. Current total 8064, remaining 106. So we cannot add anything unless we remove something. Maybe swap out something with low my value: B16(3) not in; C06(30) not in; C65(121) not in; B21(138) not in; B75(235) not in; B69(97) is in with effort 85 and value 97—pretty efficient; B53(65) not in; C70(105) not in. Items in set with low my value: B21 not in; C65 not in; C06 not in. All in-set items are high value to me except maybe B69(97) but it’s very low effort 85 and good density. The set seems near-optimal for me. Check if any in-set with lower value density could be swapped with C92(215,201) to increase value while staying under limit. Need to free 201 effort margin: current margin 106, need to drop at least 95 effort. Candidate to drop with lower value than 215 but enough effort: B45 (eff143, value 461) too valuable. A05 (401,389) high value density 0.97; dropping A05 frees 401 allows adding C92 + maybe more, but value loss 389 > gain 215, net -174, not good. A58 (428,457) dropping loses 457 > 215. A84(641,500) dropping loses 500. A89(246,508) high density, keep. C34(568,484) density 0.85, dropping loses 484. B69(85,97) small. B46(133,606) high. B12(80,915) keep. B10(59,623) keep. C15(31,781) keep. So no beneficial swap. The opponent’s proposal is excellent for me. Best action: AGREE immediately to lock in.

Efforts of proposed set sum 8064 (given). I’ll compute my importance for each included item and see if any low-importance to me can be swapped for high-importance excluded items while staying under 8170. High-value-to-me excluded items: B12(915) is already included; A16(856) included; A08(868) included; A27(822) included; A66(822) included; C15(781) included; B60(808) included; B09(786) included; B10(623) included; B94(783) included; B67(780) included; C81(713) included; C12(668) included; A30(739) included; A89(508) included; A84(500) included; C34(484) included; A58(457) included; B45(461) included; A05(389) included. So proposal already contains most of my top items. Potential adds: B21(138, eff594), C35(444,684), C24(273,699), B53(65,440), C65(121,893), C92(215,201), A23(262,734), A05 already in, A58 in, A23 not in, A66 in, B75(235,612), B85(400,806), B16(3,416), C70(105,689), C06(30,958). The best additional per my value if we can fit: C92 value 215 with low effort 201 is appealing. Current total 8064, remaining 106. So we cannot add anything unless we remove something. Maybe swap out something with low my value: B16(3) not in; C06(30) not in; C65(121) not in; B21(138) not in; B75(235) not in; B69(97) is in with effort 85 and value 97—pretty efficient; B53(65) not in; C70(105) not in. Items in set with low my value: B21 not in; C65 not in; C06 not in. All in-set items are high value to me except maybe B69(97) but it’s very low effort 85 and good density. The set seems near-optimal for me. Check if any in-set with lower value density could be swapped with C92(215,201) to increase value while staying under limit. Need to free 201 effort margin: current margin 106, need to drop at least 95 effort. Candidate to drop with lower value than 215 but enough effort: B45 (eff143, value 461) too valuable. A05 (401,389) high value density 0.97; dropping A05 frees 401 allows adding C92 + maybe more, but value loss 389 > gain 215, net -174, not good. A58 (428,457) dropping loses 457 > 215. A84(641,500) dropping loses 500. A89(246,508) high density, keep. C34(568,484) density 0.85, dropping loses 484. B69(85,97) small. B46(133,606) high. B12(80,915) keep. B10(59,623) keep. C15(31,781) keep. So no beneficial swap. The opponent’s proposal is excellent for me. Best action: AGREE immediately to lock in. But rules say can only AGREE to opponent’s proposal; yes they proposed. Must include ARGUMENT at least once; include a brief positive justification without revealing scores. Provide AGREE with full set.
