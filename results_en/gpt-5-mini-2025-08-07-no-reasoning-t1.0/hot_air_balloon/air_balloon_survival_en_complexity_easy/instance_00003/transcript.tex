Calculate effort: C70 125; A27 106 (231); B10 116 (347); B45 60 (407); C34 54 (461); A84 136 (597); A30 213 (810); A08 607 (1417); A16 645 (2062); A66 517 (2579); B60 324 (2903); A89 262 (3165); A58 252 (3417); C35 106 (3523); B67 634 (4157); B94 630 (4787); B09 446 (5233); C81 601 (5834); C12 849 (6683); C15 875 (7558); This leaves 1212. Add B12 946 (8504) value +915 fits. Remaining 266. Add A23? low value 262/773 no. C92 164 value 215 (8668) remaining 102. Add C70 already. Maybe A27 etc included. Add B45 etc included. Any item ≤102 effort: none except C34(54) already, B45(60) already, C35(106) slightly over. A27 106 included. So total effort 8668 fits under 8770. Total value sum high. This is a strong maximal set. Could we also add A84 already. Consider swapping C92 for another under 266 like A84 already, A58 included. Under 266 remaining 102 so only none new. Proposal seems near{-}optimal for my values.

That’s very strong. I’ll see if I can squeeze in one or two more of my high{-}value items within limit: we have 8770{-}8668=102 slack, so only items with effort ≤102 can be added; none exist. Consider swaps: remove a low{-}importance{-}to{-}me item to add a higher{-}importance one of similar effort. Candidates to add (my high importance not included) sorted by value/effort: B21(138,830) low, B00(583,638), A23(262,773), C65(121,455), B53(65,382), B69(97,832), C06(30,980), B85(400,842), C24(273,763), B75(235,520), B46(606,407), A05(389,801), B16(3,649). The standout is B46 (606 importance, 407 effort). To add 407 effort, remove items totaling ≥305 effort beyond the 102 slack: candidates with low importance to me in current set: C92(215,164), B45(461,60) is high imp so keep, C34(484,54) high, A84(500,136) medium{-}high, A58(457,252), C35(444,106). Lowest importance present seems C92(215). Next lowest maybe A84(500) is not low. Maybe swap out C92(164 effort) plus something else like A58(252) total 416, to add B46(407). Importance change: {-}215 {-}457 +606 = {-}66 net loss, not good. What about replace C92(164) + C35(106)=270 to add B46(407) still need 37 more, maybe add remove B45(60) but that’s 461 importance lost; net {-}70. What about removing A84(136,500) + C92(164,215) = 300, still short 107; remove C34(54,484) => total 354, still short 53; remove B10(116,623) gets too costly. Try remove B60(324,808) + C92(164,215)=488 to add B46(407), net importance: {-}808 {-}215 +606 = {-}417, worse. Try swap in B00(583,638) by removing what? Need 638{-}102=536 effort freed; remove A84(136,500) + A58(252,457) + C92(164,215) = 552; importance: {-}500 {-}457 {-}215 +583 = {-}589 net. Not good. Any other high{-}value add?
