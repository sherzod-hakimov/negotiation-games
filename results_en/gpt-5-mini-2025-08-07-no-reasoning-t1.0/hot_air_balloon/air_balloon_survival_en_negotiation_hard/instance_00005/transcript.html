    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p1" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Compute value/effort ratios to prioritize. Ratios: C54 1.811, B41 0.81, A04 2.386, A77 0.742, A03 0.848, C01 0.722, C00 0.568, C17 0.441, A71 0.371, A87 53.75, B86 1.253, A10 0.915, B35 0.191, B32 0.14, B33 0.0505. Obvious must-keep A87 (effort 4). High value set aiming under 3386: Start with top ratios: A87, A04, C54, B86, A10, A03, B41. Compute effort sum: 4+203+369+399+437+544+720=2676; importance sum: 215+484+668+500+400+461+583=3311. Remaining capacity 710. Fit more: C01 (539, +389) -&gt; effort 3215, remain 171. None of remaining fit except A71 (175) slightly over, C17 313 over, C00 461 over, B35 635 over, B32 695 over, B33 594 over, A77 685 over. Alternative: try swapping B41 (720) for A77 (685, imp 508) to see if we can fit extras: With A77 instead of B41, effort becomes 2641, importance 3236; remaining 745 allows A71 (175) -&gt; 2816, +65=3301; remaining 570 allows C00 (461) -&gt; 3277, +262=3563; remaining 109 none else. This totals effort 2816+461=3277, leaving 109; items: {A87,A04,C54,B86,A10,A03,A77,A71,C00}. Importance 3563 vs previous 3700? Check previous: with B41 and C01 we had 3311+389=3700. That seems higher. Compare possibility: Use B41 and also A71 instead of C01: previous base 2676; add A71 (175) -&gt; 2851, +65=3376 within limit; remaining 10 cannot add. Importance 3311+65=3376, which is slightly less than with C01 (3700). Try adding C00 instead of C01: 2676+461=3137; remaining 249 could add A71? 175 fits -&gt; 3312 effort, importance +262+65=3638 still less than 3700. Try swapping A10 (437, 400) out to fit more? Base without A10: 2676-437=2239; we could add C01 (539) -&gt; 2778; add A77 (685) -&gt; 3463 exceeds. Try adding A77 and C01 by dropping B41 (720): base minus B41 (720) becomes 1956; add A77 685 -&gt; 2641; add C01 539 -&gt; 3180; remaining 206 could we add A04 already in base yes; add A71 175 -&gt; 3355 within; importance: base without B41 3311-583=2728; +A77 508=3236; +C01 389=3625; +A71 65=3690. Still less than 3700 by 10. Try replacing A03 (544,461) with C01 (539,389) to fit something else with B41: Base with B41 had 2676; if we swap A03 out: effort 2676-544+539=2671; importance 3311-461+389=3239; remaining 715 allows A77 (685) -&gt; 3356, importance +508=3747, which beats 3700 and still under limit 3356&lt;=3386. Set would be {A87,A04,C54,B86,A10,B41,C01,A77}. Check efforts: 4+203+369+399+437+720+539+685=3356 ok. Importance: 215+484+668+500+400+583+389+508=3746? Recalc: 215+484=699; +668=1367; +500=1867; +400=2267; +583=2850; +389=3239; +508=3747 correct. This seems my best found. Can we also add A71? Remaining 30 cannot. Any other swap to increase more? A03 gave 461 importance; replacing it with A77+ C01 combination effectively used similar effort +680? We already counted. Try replacing A10 (400,437) with C00 (262,461) plus A71 (65,175) using freed effort: From 3356, if remove A10 437 -&gt; 2919; add C00 461 -&gt; 3380; can&#x27;t add A71 (would be 3555) exceeds. So not good. Try replacing B86 (500,399) with C00 262,461 net effort +62 to 3418 exceed. Replace B41 (583,720) with C00 (262,461) and A71 (65,175): New from best set 3356-720+461+175=3272; importance 3747-583+262+65=3491 worse. Conclusion: Best found set is {A87,A04,C54,B86,A10,B41,C01,A77} with effort 3356 and highest importance 3747. I will propose this assertively and argue on high combined value and balance. I will avoid revealing my scores and stress feasibility and diversity. Ready to negotiate and willing to consider small swaps that keep total under limit.&#x27;}<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;C01&#x27;, &#x27;A77&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;This set stays comfortably under the limit while covering a broad mix of items with strong overall value and minimal deadweight.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg player-gm p2" style="">
        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;I’ll compute my utility and effort. Efforts: A87(4), A04(203), C54(369), B86(399), A10(437), B41(720), C01(539), A77(685). Total effort = 4+203+369+399+437+720+539+685 = 3356, which is ≤ 3386 (barely fits). My importance: A87(461), A04(138), C54(30), B86(121), A10(262), B41(65), C01(389), A77(97). Sum = 1563. I should see if I can improve by swapping out low-importance-for-me items for high-importance ones while keeping under limit. My top values: B33(668, 594 effort), A71(583, 175), B32(508, 695), B35(500, 635), C17(484, 313), C00(400, 461), C01(389 included), A10(262 included), A03(215, 544), A04(138 included), B86(121 included), A77(97 included), B41(65 included), C54(30 included), A87(461 included). Candidate improvements: Add A71 (175, 583 value) is huge. Add C17 (313, 484). Add B33 (594, 668). We need to remove to keep ≤3386. Current effort 3356. If I add A71(175), need to drop at least 175 effort. Best drop low-value-for-me high-effort: B41(720, value 65) is prime to remove. Remove B41 and add A71 reduces effort by 545 net, new effort 2811, value change: -65 +583 = +518 =&gt; 2081 total. Great. Then consider adding C17(313), new effort 3124, value +484 = 2565. Add C00(461), effort 3585 would exceed; too much. Maybe add B33(594) would exceed (3124+594=3718) too high. Add A03(544) =&gt; 3668 too high. Add B35(635) too high. Add C00 only if we drop something else. What else low-value/high-effort to drop: C54(369, 30) is weak; dropping it frees 369. If we drop C54 and add C00(461): net +92 effort. From 3124 +92 = 3216, still ≤3386, value change: -30 +400 = +370, new value 2935. Great. Could we also add A03(544)? 3216+544=3760 too high. Maybe add B33 if we drop A77(685, 97) to fit: Try adding B33(594,668) and dropping A77(685,97): effort 3216 -685 +594 = 3125, value +668 -97 = +571 -&gt; 3506. That’s huge. Check set now: {A87, A04, B86, A10, C01, A71, C17, C00, B33} plus we removed B41, C54, A77. Count included initially 8; now we have 9 items. Compute effort: A87 4, A04 203, B86 399, A10 437, C01 539, A71 175, C17 313, C00 461, B33 594. Sum: 4+203=207; +399=606; +437=1043; +539=1582; +175=1757; +313=2070; +461=2531; +594=3125. Under limit. Value sum: A87 461 + A04 138 = 599; + B86 121 = 720; + A10 262 = 982; + C01 389 = 1371; + A71 583 = 1954; + C17 484 = 2438; + C00 400 = 2838; + B33 668 = 3506. This is excellent. Maybe also add A03 by dropping something? Remaining slack 3386-3125=261. A03 is 544, too large. B35 635 too big. B32 695 too big. C54 369 too big. B41 720 too big. A77 685 too big. So this seems a strong proposal. From negotiation perspective, present it as targeted swaps improving balance and still under limit, noting we removed heavier items to include more efficient ones.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Evaluate their proposal vs my best set. Their set: items = {A87(4,215), A04(203,484), B86(399,500), A10(437,400), C01(539,389), A71(175,65), C17(313,138), C00(461,262), B33(594,30)}. Effort sum: 4+203+399+437+539+175+313+461+594=3125 &lt;= 3386. Importance to me: 215+484+500+400+389+65+138+262+30=2483. My proposed best set had importance 3747. Huge drop; I should refuse and counter. Which of theirs are low value to me? B33 (30/594 awful), A71 low (65/175), C17 low (138/313), C00 moderate (262/461), C01 good, A04 great, B86 great, A10 good, A87 must-have. I want to add C54 (668/369) and A77 (508/685) and B41 (583/720) and A03 (461/544) if possible with constraints. My best set earlier: {A87, A04, C54, B86, A10, B41, C01, A77} effort 3356 within limit; I should re-propose that, argue that it swaps out their low-yield items (B33, C17, A71, C00) for higher-impact while staying under limit. Offer willingness to discuss a single substitution if they have a must-have, e.g., we could trade B41 for C00+A71 cannot fit; but maybe trade A10 for C00 keeps under? From best set, replacing A10(437) with C00(461) increases effort by 24 to 3380 still under; importance drops 138. Or replace A10 with C17 (313) effort -124, importance -262 not good. Or include one of their must-haves by swapping closest effort: If they insist on C00, suggest swapping A10 -&gt; C00. Keep flexibility. Proceed: REFUSE and counter PROPOSAL with my best set. Provide ARGUMENT explaining efficiency and staying within limit, and offer a concession path if they want C00: propose an alternate variant swapping A10 for C00 as acceptable.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their repeated proposal effort is 3356 and gives me low utility on C54(30), B41(65), A77(97) versus my very high utility for A71(583), C17(484), B33(668), C00(400). I should counter with a compromise that keeps most of their structure but improves my value while staying ≤3386. Since they offered swapping C00 for A10 as acceptable, I’ll take that. Also, B41 and C54 are very low for me; replacing them with A71 and C17 improves my value and still fits. Keep A77 and B86 from their set to show flexibility.

They offered dropping B41 for A10 previously; that improves me: swap B41-&gt;A10 gives effort -720+437 = -283; new effort 3097. Value gain +262-65 = +197.

This keeps many of their items (A87, A04, B86, A77, C01, C00) and follows their suggestion of A10 in place of B41, while replacing only C54 with C17 and adding A71 with slack. I’ll present it as using their suggested swap and making efficient use of leftover capacity, and offer a single swap back (e.g., if they must keep C54, we can trade C17 or A71).

Effort = 3416? Compute: 4+203+399+685+539+461+437+175+313 = 3216; actually 3216, under 3386. My importance total = 215+484+500+508+389+262+400+65+138 = 2961. This still includes two very low-value items for me (A71, C17). I previously proposed keeping C54 as a key high-impact item. They offered to swap C54 back in for either A71 or C17. Best move: accept their structure but replace one of A71 or C17 with C54, ensuring feasibility. Check feasibility replacing A71 (175) with C54 (369): effort 3216 -175 +369 = 3410, which exceeds limit? 3216 -175 = 3041; +369 = 3410 &gt; 3386 by 24, so not feasible.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;Their latest proposal replaces my high-value C17 (484 for me) with C54 (30 for me). The set they propose is {A87, A04, B86, A77, C01, C00, A10, A71, C54}. Effort: 4+203+399+685+539+461+437+175+369 = 3272 ≤ 3386. My utility on their set: 461+138+121+97+389+400+262+583+30 = 2481. If I swap C54 -&gt; C17, effort becomes 3216 and my utility increases by +454 to 2935; that’s my previous counter which they refused. They hinted they’d discuss dropping A71 instead if I insist on C17; A71 is extremely valuable to me (583), so I will not drop it. I’ll counter with keeping C17 and dropping the lowest-impact remaining item for me to placate them—C54 is already the lowest; next lowest is B41 (not present), then A77(97). If I offer replacing C54 with C17 while keeping everything else identical, that’s exactly my last counter. To show movement, I can offer to include C54 as an extra by dropping A77 (net effort change: -685 +369 = -316) and adding C17 (+313) to keep both C54 and C17 while removing A77. New set: {A87, A04, B86, C01, C00, A10, A71, C54, C17}. Effort: 4+203+399+539+461+437+175+369+313 = 2900. My utility: 461+138+121+389+400+262+583+30+484 = 2868. This concedes C54 and removes A77 (low for me) while maintaining many of their picks. This might be acceptable to them since they’ve been pushing C54 strongly; they also valued A77 earlier, but I’m offering to keep their C54 and everything else including their A10 swap and A71.

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: {&#x27;They are fixated on including C54 and A77. My utility suffers mainly from C54 (very low for me). The rest of their latest set is acceptable. I’ll try one final minimal counter offering to keep everything they want and simply include C17 alongside C54 by dropping the single weakest remaining item for me that they haven’t insisted on changing—A04 (low effort, moderate value to me). But dropping A04 might upset them; better pick a concession they previously accepted: they were fine with A10 in place of B41, and A10 is already in. The only way to add C17 without removing their must-haves is to suggest a swap of C54’s pair, but they won’t drop C54. Alternatively, propose an expanded set by swapping out the lowest-impact for-me item they haven’t emphasized: B86 (they’ve kept it throughout but not as hardline as C54/A77). If I propose keeping C54 and add C17 by dropping B86, effort: current 3272 -399 +313 = 3186, under limit. My value improves a lot: -B86(121) + C17(484) = +363. Set: {A87, A04, C01, C00, A10, A71, A77, C54, C17}. This keeps all items they insisted on (C54, A77) and everything else from their last proposal except B86, which they haven’t explicitly marked as must-have recently. I’ll present it as a single-slot refinement that retains their mix while staying comfy under limit.
