	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'We need to stay under effort 3624 and maximize our importance. Compute value/effort ratios: A87 461/14=32.9, A03 262/25=10.5, C00 822/111=7.41, A04 121/121=1, C17 138/210=0.66, B41 583/291=2.00, B86 668/304=2.20, B32 484/559=0.87, C54 508/583=0.87, C01 780/766=1.02, A10 808/691=1.17, A71 868/831=1.04, A77 65/827=0.08, B35 783/926=0.85, B33 389/989=0.39. A87, A03, C00, B86, B41 are very efficient. High absolute values: A71 868, A10 808, C01 780, B35 783, B86 668, B41 583, C54 508, B32 484. Let's try to build a near-knapsack: start with must-haves A87, A03, C00, B86, B41 = efforts 14+25+111+304+291=745, value 461+262+822+668+583=2796. Remaining effort 3624-745=2879. Add A71 (831): effort 1576, value 3664. Add A10 (691): effort 2267, value 4472. Add C01 (766): effort 3033, value 5252. Remaining 591. What can we add ≤591: candidates C54 583 (508), C17 210 (138), A04 121 (121). Best is C54 583 fits exactly with 3033+583=3616 ≤3624 adding 508 value: total 5760. Remaining 8 cannot fit others. This seems strong. Alternative swap C17+A04 (331 effort, 259 value) leaves 361, could add nothing else; 5760 > 5511, so current set better. Check if B35 926 (783) instead of C54: 3033+926=3959 exceeds. What about replacing something to include B35? If we drop C54 and include C17+A04 (331) we can also add C17+A04 (value 259) vs C54 508, so C54 better. Could we also include B32 559 (484) instead of C54 583 (508): 3033+559=3592 within limit; total value 5252+484=5736, still slightly less than 5760, so C54 better than B32. Consider adding both C17 and A04 by swapping out something: try drop B41 (291, 583) to free space to add C17 and A04 (331, 259). Net effort +40, net value -324 which is worse. Drop B86 (304,668) to add C17+A04 (331): net effort +27, net value -409 worse. Drop C01 (766,780) to add B35 (926,783) uses +160 effort and +3 value, but may break limit; recompute without C01: baseline set without C01 but with others and C54 had effort 3616-766=2850, value 5760-780=4980. Add B35 926 -> effort 3776 > limit. Add B32 559 -> effort 3409, value 5464 (< with C01). So original set seems near-optimal. Therefore propose {A87, A03, C00, B86, B41, A71, A10, C01, C54} effort 3616, within limit, very strong to me. I will present it confidently and note it fits limit with diverse coverage. If they refuse, I can consider swapping C54 for B32, or propose a smaller core set {A87,A03,C00,B86,B41,A71,A10,C01} effort 3033 for flexibility with room for one of their priorities up to 591 effort.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A87', 'A03', 'C00', 'B86', 'B41', 'A71', 'A10', 'C01', 'C54'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'This set stays under the effort limit (total effort 3616 ≤ 3624) and balances quick wins with substantial items.

I should try to keep both while inserting at least one of my high-value items (A77, A04, C17) by swapping something they may value less in their set. Their offer already includes C54 (583) which I value decently, and all seven core items overlap. To add one of my top picks without exceeding the limit, I can propose adding A04 (121) by dropping the least costly/lowest marginal-to-them candidate. From their language, C54 was swappable; swapping C54(583) for A04(121) reduces effort by 462 while likely preserving their utility because they offered that swap region. That keeps A71 and A10 for them, and gains me a very high-importance item A04. I can also try to add C17 (210) with the saved capacity by dropping nothing else if we keep A71 and A10? But we must respect total effort: starting from their proposal 3616; if I swap C54->A04, new effort = 3616 - 583 + 121 = 3154, leaving 470 slack. I could then propose also adding C17 (210) without removing anything else, bringing total to 3364 ≤ 3624. That gives me two high-value adds while respecting their desire to keep A71 and A10. This seems a strong conciliatory counter. I’ll propose set: their nine minus C54 plus A04 plus C17, i.e., {A87,A03,C00,B86,B41,A71,A10,C01,A04,C17}. Effort 3364. It keeps their “high-impact” A71 and A10 and most of their core, replaces only C54 which they flagged as swappable, and adds C17 which I value highly.

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Evaluate their new proposal set S = {A87, A03, C00, B86, B41, A71, A10, C01, A04, C17}. Effort: 14+25+111+304+291+831+691+766+121+210 = 3364 ≤ 3624. My importance: 461+262+822+668+583+868+808+780+121+138 = 5511. My previous preferred set with C54 instead of A04 and C17 had value 5760, so I lose 249 value by swapping C54 (508) for A04 (121) and C17 (138). However, their offer includes both A71 and A10, which are major for me, and keeps all core. To improve, try counter with C54 back and drop C17: set {A87, A03, C00, B86, B41, A71, A10, C01, C54, A04}? Effort = 3364 - C17(210) + C54(583) = 3737 > limit. What about replace both A04 and C17 with C54: 3364 - 121 - 210 + 583 = 3616 ≤ limit, value increases by +508 -121 -138 = +249, recovering my best set exactly {A87,A03,C00,B86,B41,A71,A10,C01,C54}. They already signaled willingness to revert C54 by removing C17. Perfect. I should counter with that precise swap. If they insist on keeping one of A04 or C17, the better for me is A04 (121) vs C17 (138) but both are low; to include one, I’d need to drop something: with my best set effort 3616, only 8 spare, so cannot add anything. Next-best conciliatory swap is C54 -> B32 (559) to free 24 effort, still cannot add A04 (needs 121). Or swap C54 -> B32 and drop a small item to add A04? No small droppable besides A03 (25) and A87 (14) which are too valuable to me. So optimal counter is my original best set, pointing out we accept their structure but revert to C54 instead of A04 and C17 to stay under cap and maximize overall outcome. I will refuse and propose that.
