I should try to add high-value items by replacing low-value ones while keeping effort ≤3681. Top remaining items by my value with efforts: A77(940,868), A04(392,822), C17(700,808), A03(387,783), B33(613,780), B86(651,461). Identify weakest currently included by my value: A71(65,505), C00(121,116), A10(138,740), B35(262,664). Try swapping A04(392,822) for A71(505,65): effort change -113, value +757. New set effort 3567, value 3975. Great. We can also add A03(387,783) by removing A10(740,138): effort change -353, value +645 -> effort 3214, value 4620. We have lots of slack; maybe we can add more by replacing low-valued C00(116,121) or B35(664,262) with higher ones like B33(613,780) and C17(700,808) and maybe A77(940,868). Start from improved baseline: S1 = S0 - {A71, A10} + {A04, A03}. Effort 3680 -505 -740 +392 +387 = 3214. Now try to add B33(613,780) by swapping out B35(664,262): effort + (613-664) = -51, value +518. New effort 3163, value 5138. Add C17(700,808) by swapping out B41(586,484): effort +114, value +324 -> effort 3277, value 5462. Still under limit. Add A77(940,868) by swapping out C00(116,121): effort +824, value +747 -> effort 4101 exceeds limit. Not possible; instead swap A77 for something heavier: candidates to drop to fit +940 somewhere. Current set items and efforts: {A87(4), C54(209), B32(285), C01(571), B35 gone, B41 gone, C00 maybe still in? We swapped C00 out in that attempted step; but rollback: current accepted set before A77 attempt is S2 = {A87, C00, C54, B32, C01, B35?, no B35, we replaced with B33, yes B33 present, A04, A03, C17}. So S2 items: A87(4), C00(116), C54(209), B32(285), C01(571), B33(613), A04(392), A03(387), C17(700). Effort 3277. To add A77(940) we need +940, so total would be 4217; must drop at least 4217-3681 = 536 effort. Drop one or more items totaling ≥536 effort with least value loss. Candidates low value per effort: C00(116,121), maybe C01(571,389), B32(285,583 high), C54(209,508 high), A87(4,668 huge), A03/A04 highly valued, B33 780 high, C17 808 high. Best to drop C01 (571 effort, 389 value). If we add A77 and drop C01 and maybe keep C00, net effort: 3277 +940 -571 = 3646 within limit, net value +868 -389 = +479. New set S3 = S2 - {C01} + {A77}. Value S2 was 5462; new 5941, effort 3646. Great and under limit. Could we also upgrade C00(116,121) to something else with remaining slack 3681-3646=35; no. Could we also bring back B41(586,484) by dropping something else? We have 35 slack only, so no additions without swaps. Maybe consider swapping C00(116,121) plus some other to fit B41(586). Need +470 effort; dropping C00 frees 116, still need 470; would have to drop something valuable; probably not worth. What about swapping in B86(651,461) for C00(116,121) and some effort room: need +535 effort; would need to drop more—likely not worth versus high value items we have. Current best set value 5941. Ensure all items exist efforts total ≤3681. Propose S3 as my offer. It’s a significant improvement for me while still reasonable; defend with efficiency arguments: replaced low-impact items (A71, A10, C01) with higher-impact (A04, A03, C17, A77) while staying under limit. Provide openness to adjust one swap if they strongly value C01; we could reconsider C01 by possibly swapping out C00 and some minor change, but we have little slack; maybe replace C00+something like adjust B32? But B32 is high for me; I can offer to consider B41 back by dropping C00 and tweaking, but effort doesn’t allow. I’ll invite their counter if they need C01 back; then we might trade out B32 (285,583) for C01 (571,389) and another high value? That would increase effort by 286, exceeding. Not now.
