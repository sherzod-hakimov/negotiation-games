A greedy approach by ratio suggests keeping many small, high{-}ratio items first, then add big{-}ticket ones while staying under 7351. I’ll construct a proposal aiming high total importance while leaving room for partner to accept, maybe include a spread across A/B/C. Compute a candidate set: include many small efficient items: C51, A46, A25, C79, B37, A39, B15, A97, B23, A96, A28, A75, B96, B19, B69, C53, A94, A71, A88, B43, B95, C10, C60. Check effort sum.

Remaining capacity 7351{-}6738=613.

With 432 left, which remaining not included? A65, C17, etc big. Maybe add A08(518) too big; B34(224) ok; B34 {-}> 7143; remaining 208. Could add A97 already in; maybe A25 already; A46 already; C79 already; B37 already; A39 already; B15 already; C51 already; C82 added; B81 190 fits {-}> 7333; remaining 18. Great.

                \texttt{STRATEGIC REASONING: \{'I need to check if their proposal is within the limit. Sum efforts of their set: C72(985)+A87(928)=1913; +C83(900)=2813; +C84(853)=3666; +C60(813)=4479; +B16(814)=5293; +B64(826)=6119; +C10(744)=6863; +A65(780)=7643 exceeds 7351 already, and they still have many more items listed. So their proposal is far over the limit, violating rules. I should REFUSE and counter with a high{-}importance set for me within 7351, ideally including some of their highlighted big items they seem to want: they like C72, A87, C83, C84, C60, B16, B64, C10, A65, C17. I can’t include many of those because effort will explode. I’ll craft a counter that keeps some of their mid{-}cost overlaps (B43, B95, C10, C60, A71, A88, A94, B69, C53, B96, A75, A28, A96, A97, B23) which they mentioned, plus one or two of their top picks to show goodwill—pick C72 (my top value) and maybe A87 (also high for me). Check feasibility with my prior efficient base set, and adjust. Start with my previous accepted set of 26 items effort 7333. If I want to add C72 (985) and A87 (928), I must remove items totaling about 188? Wait capacity left 18; adding either requires removing items. Better: propose a different set: include C72 and A87 and keep many small items, dropping some mids (C60, B95, B43) to fit. Construct anew maximizing my value: Keep high{-}value bigs: C72(985), A87(928), C83(900?) maybe too many bigs, but C83=900 with high value. Try include C10(744) too? Let’s build greedy around value/efficiency smalls first then add a couple of bigs. Start with the efficient smalls from before: C51(45), A46(60), A25(65), C79(61), B37(92), A39(96), B15(101), A97(150), B23(154), A96(206), C82(181), B81(190), B34(224), A28(231), A75(234), B96(237), B19(294), B69(312), C53(322), A94(353), A71(454), A88(454). Sum effort: compute: 45+60=105; +65=170; +61=231; +92=323; +96=419; +101=520; +150=670; +154=824; +206=1030; +181=1211; +190=1401; +224=1625; +231=1856; +234=2090; +237=2327; +294=2621; +312=2933; +322=3255; +353=3608; +454=4062; +454=4516. Left 2835. Now add bigs: C72(985) {-}> 5501; A87(928) {-}> 6429; We have 922 left. Add C10(744) {-}> 7173; remaining 178. With 178 left, can we add anything not yet included under 178 effort? Candidates: C51 already included; A46 included; A25 included; C79 included; B37 included; A39 included; B15 included; A97 included; C82 included; B23 included; maybe A08(518) too big; B95(656) no; B43(604) no; A65(780) no; C17(766) no; C84(853) no; B64(826) no; B16(814) no; A71 already; A88 already. We could add A94 already included. So effort 7173 within 7351. This set includes many of their mid{-}cost overlaps plus their must{-}haves C72 and A87 and C10. It omits C83, C84, C60, B16, B64, A65, C17 due to capacity. This should be a strong counter. Compute importance total to ensure it’s good for me: Sum importance of the 22 small/mids up to A88 from my earlier list excluding B95, B43, C60, C10 not yet accounted. Earlier, the big 26 set had total 9881 including C10 and C60 and B95, B43, C82, B34, B81. Now my current set: base 22 includes C51 143, A46 158(301), A25 163(464), C79 159(623), B37 190(813), A39 194(1007), B15 199(1206), A97 248(1454), B23 252(1706), A96 304(2010), C82 279(2289), B81 288(2577), B34 322(2899), A28 329(3228), A75 332(3560), B96 335(3895), B19 392(4287), B69 410(4697), C53 420(5117), A94 451(5568), A71 552(6120), A88 552(6672). Add C72 1083 {-}> 7755; add A87 1026 {-}> 8781; add C10 842 {-}> 9623. This is close to my previous 9881, decent. I’ll propose this set. Provide argument: within limit, includes several of their highlighted top items (C72, A87, C10) and many of their listed mid{-}cost anchors; offer swaps: if they insist on e.g., C83 or C84, we can trade out C10 plus one or two mids to fit, or replace A87 with C83, etc. Also note their previous proposal exceeded the limit. I must include REFUSE to their proposal. Then PROPOSAL with my set. Include ARGUMENT about feasibility and swap options.'\}} \\

                \texttt{STRATEGIC REASONING: \{'First, verify their legality claim and evaluate value to me. Compute effort of their new proposal: C51(45)+A46(60)+A25(65)+C79(61)+B37(92)+A39(96)+B15(101)+A97(150)+B23(154)+A96(206)+C82(181)+B81(190)+B34(224)+A28(231)+A75(234)+B96(237)+B19(294)+B69(312)+C53(322)+A94(353)+A71(454)+A88(454)+C72(985)+A87(928)+C10(744) = 7173, so it’s within limit. Now compute my total importance for this set to decide whether to accept or counter. Sum importance: C51(143)+A46(158)+A25(163)+C79(159)+B37(190)+A39(194)+B15(199)+A97(248)+B23(252)+A96(304)+C82(279)+B81(288)+B34(322)+A28(329)+A75(332)+B96(335)+B19(392)+B69(410)+C53(420)+A94(451)+A71(552)+A88(552)+C72(1083)+A87(1026)+C10(842). Let me sum: (143+158)=301; +163=464; +159=623; +190=813; +194=1007; +199=1206; +248=1454; +252=1706; +304=2010; +279=2289; +288=2577; +322=2899; +329=3228; +332=3560; +335=3895; +392=4287; +410=4697; +420=5117; +451=5568; +552=6120; +552=6672; +1083=7755; +1026=8781; +842=9623. That’s very high. Check if I could improve by swapping out low{-}value items for e.g., C83(998,900) or C84(951,853) or C60(911,813) or B16(912,814) or B64(924,826) or A65(878,780) or C17(864,766). But we only have 178 effort slack (7351{-}7173). To add any of these heavy items, we’d need to drop multiple items. Which low{-}importance items currently included? The smallest importance ones: C51(143), A46(158), C79(159), A25(163), A39(194), B37(190), B15(199). Their efforts sum: 45+60+61+65+96+92+101 = 520. If we removed, say, three or four of them, could we insert one heavy? For example to add C83(900 effort, 998 importance), we must free 900{-}178=722 effort {-}> need to drop more than just the tiny ones; would also require dropping mid items like A75(234) etc. The net gain vs loss? If we drop C51(143,45), A46(158,60), C79(159,61), A25(163,65), A39(194,96), B37(190,92), B15(199,101) total loss importance 1206, effort 520. To add C83 we still need 900{-} (we freed 520+178=698) actually we need 202 more, so drop e.g., B34(322,224) effort 224 importance 322. Then we can add C83. Net importance change: +998 {-} (1206+322) = {-}530, bad. So current set likely near my optimum given inclusion of C72, A87, C10 and many mid anchors I value. So best move: accept to secure high personal value. Must include ARGUMENT at least once; and AGREE can only be to an active proposal, which this is. I’ll AGREE with their set.'\}} \\
