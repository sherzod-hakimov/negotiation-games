	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'I should open with a high-value, effort-efficient proposal that leaves room for concessions. Compute value/effort ratios and target items with high importance and reasonable effort. Also include a few low-effort fillers to approach the limit. I’ll avoid extremely high-effort, low-efficiency items unless their importance is outstanding. I’ll prepare to trade off some medium items if the partner pushes back. I’ll ensure total effort ≤ 9322. Let’s build a near-knapsack solution. Start by prioritizing: B81(992/896=1.11), B34(917/821=1.12), A87(1058/962=1.10), B37(988/892=1.11), B23(959/863=1.11), A96(862/766=1.13), A75(864/768=1.13), C60(755/659=1.15), B16(758/662=1.15), B64(715/619=1.16), A97(775/679=1.14), C51(867/771=1.12), C83(926/830=1.12), C79(694/598=1.16), C10(658/562=1.17), A39(664/568=1.17), A28(622/526=1.18), C72(600/504=1.19), C82(598/502=1.19), A46(610/514=1.19), A88(717/621=1.15), B95(544/448=1.21), C84(536/440=1.22), B96(415/319=1.30), B69(422/326=1.29), C53(396/300=1.32), A25(379/283=1.34), B43(322/226=1.42), A94(214/118=1.81), C17(185/89=2.08), A71(108/12=9.0), B15(211/115=1.83). Build a strong set near limit: include many high ratios and some top absolute values. Let’s greedily add: A71, C17, A94, B15, B43, A25, C53, B96, B69, C84, B95, A28, A46, C82, C72, C10, A39, C79, B64, B16, C60, A97, A96, A75. Check effort sum stepwise: 12+89=101; +118=219; +115=334; +226=560; +283=843; +300=1143; +319=1462; +326=1788; +440=2228; +448=2676; +526=3202; +514=3716; +502=4218; +504=4722; +562=5284; +568=5852; +598=6450; +619=7069; +662=7731; +659=8390; +679=9069; +766=9835 exceeds limit. Remove A96 for now. 9069 within limit. Maybe add some remaining high absolute value if small effort left: limit 9322-9069=253. Candidates with effort ≤253: A71(12 already), C17(89 already), A94(118 already), B15(115 already), B43(226 already), maybe none new small ones left. B15 and B43 already included. Efforts <=253 not yet included: check items list: B15 115 included; C17 89 included; A71 12 included; A94 118 included; B43 226 included. A25 283 too big. So current set is tight. Value sum compute roughly high; this looks strong. I’ll propose this set. Prepare to argue efficiency and that it leaves room to swap if they have must-haves.

	 STRATEGIC REASONING: {'Their counterproposal adds many of my high-importance, high-effort items (B81, B34, B23, B37, C83, C51, A96, A88) while keeping my efficient core. I must verify feasibility: sum efforts. My prior set (without A96) was 9069. They removed C79(598) and B64(619) and B16(662) = -1879 and added B81(896)+B34(821)+B23(863)+B37(892)+C83(830)+C51(771)+A96(766)+A88(621) = 6460. So new total ≈ 9069 - 1879 + 6460 = 13650, which exceeds 9322 by a lot. Therefore their proposal is invalid. I should REFUSE and present a feasible counter that preserves some of their must-haves but trims to fit. Since they said B81, B34, B23, B37 are critical, I can try to keep a subset of those, but including all four (~3472 effort) is heavy. My efficient core currently 2676 (through B95) + rest to 9069; but I’ll recompute a lean, high-value set that includes at least two of their criticals to build cooperation while maximizing my value: I’ll try keeping B37 and B23 (effort 892+863=1755, both very high importance for me too), plus keep my previous high-efficiency backbone. Start from my prior 9069 set and see if I can swap in B37 and B23 by removing some mid items to stay ≤9322. My prior set effort 9069; add B37 (892) -> 9961 too high; need to drop ~639. Drop C79(598) already removed in their proposal, but my current proposal didn’t include C79? My prior did include C79; yes original had C79, B64, B16. If I drop C79 (598), net becomes 9069 - 598 + 892 = 9363 still over. Also drop B64 (619) then 8744 + 892 = 9636; that’s wrong. Better rebuild from core efficient items and add selected high-value: Keep low-effort core: A71(12), C17(89), A94(118), B15(115), B43(226), A25(283), C53(300), B96(319), B69(326), C84(440), B95(448) => subtotal 2676. Add strong mediums from my prior: A28(526), A46(514), C82(502), C72(504), C10(562), A39(568) => +3176 => total 5852. Add A97(679), C60(659) => +1338 => 7190. Add A75(768) => 7958. Now I can add their criticals selectively: add B37(892) => 8850. Add B23(863) would go to 9713 > limit; instead try B34(821) => 9671 > limit; try B81(896) => 9746 > limit. So with B37 included, I can add at most a small additional item ≤ 472 effort. Candidates not yet included small: maybe C84 already, B96, B69 included. Could add C83(830) no; C51(771) no; A96(766) no; A88(621) no. So set with B37 only fits. Alternatively, drop A75(768) to fit another critical. If I drop A75, total becomes 8850 - 768 = 8082 with B37. Then I can add B23(863) => 8945 fits; can also add a small filler up to 377. Maybe none unused under 377 except maybe A25 already, C53, B96, B69 already. Remaining under 377: maybe nothing new. That’s fine. So propose set that includes B37 and B23 (two of their criticals), maintaining high my value. This should be attractive. I will present this feasible proposal and explain their last was over the limit and I preserved their stated priorities while efficient.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt REFUSE: {'A71', 'C17', 'A94', 'B15', 'B43', 'A25', 'C53', 'B96', 'B69', 'C84', 'B95', 'A28', 'A46', 'C82', 'C72', 'C10', 'A39', 'C60', 'A97', 'A75', 'B81', 'B34', 'B23', 'B37', 'C83', 'C51', 'A96', 'A88'}\\ \tt \\ \tt PROPOSAL: {'A71', 'C17', 'A94', 'B15', 'B43', 'A25', 'C53', 'B96', 'B69', 'C84', 'B95', 'A28', 'A46', 'C82', 'C72', 'C10', 'A39', 'C60', 'A97', 'B37', 'B23'}\\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'Your last set exceeds the shared effort limit.

I’ll present a concrete under-limit counter with calculations and show willingness to swap among my top quartet. Keep their low-effort items to appear cooperative but trim some medium ones (e.g., C84, B95, C53, A25, B69) that are lower value to me per effort.
