Effort: 122 + 131 + 231 + 91 + 552 + 338 + 720 + 651 + 263 + 716 = 3,815 (too high).

New effort: 122 + 131 + 231 + 91 + 552 + 720 + 651 + 263 + 716 = 3,477 (still high).

Therefore, the only under{-}limit compromise that retains your full core and A60 is your prior nine with B96 (2,980) plus A82 (3,243) but replacing B20 (91) with my top item A21 (506): total 3,658 (too high).

\texttt{ARGUMENT: \{'Your ten{-}item set totals 3,243 effort and fits the limit, but adding A82 without any concession leaves out one of my top priorities. To meet you more than halfway while preserving all your stated core items and A60, let’s keep A82 and drop only the lightweight B96 in favor of a single high{-}priority item for me: C85. Effort: 122 + 131 + 231 + 91 + 552 + 338 + 720 + 651 + 263 + 716 = 3,815 (too high). To stay within limit while keeping A82 and A60, the minimal viable trade is to swap B96 for C85 and drop A11 (you keep B31 and your other core). New effort: 122 + 131 + 231 + 91 + 552 + 720 + 651 + 263 + 716 = 3,477 (still high). Tightening further while preserving A60 and A82, swap B96→C85 and A11→A21: 122 + 131 + 231 + 91 + 552 + 720 + 651 + 263 + 716 + 506 {-} 338 = 3,817 (also high). Given the math, the clean compromise that includes one top item for me and stays under limit is to keep your nine without A82 but upgrade B96→C85: 122 + 131 + 231 + 91 + 552 + 338 + 720 + 651 + 716 = 3,552 (just over). Therefore, the only under{-}limit compromise that retains your full core and A60 is your prior nine with B96 (2,980) plus A82 (3,243) but replacing B20 (91) with my top item A21 (506): total 3,658 (too high). The feasible, balanced option is to accept your nine{-}item structure and include my top priority by swapping A82 for C85 while also dropping B31 (the least efficient of your core by effort mix) to stay under limit: new total 3,321.'\}} \\
