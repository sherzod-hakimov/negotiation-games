        <p>I can do that. I only need one bolt at most (they&#x27;re worth 2 each to me). I&#x27;d like the chalk and maybe one or two crayons. If you&#x27;re taking both bolts, would you be okay giving me the chalk and 2 crayons? That would give me chalk (3) + 2 crayons (2) = 5 value; you&#x27;d get 2 bolts (4) and 1 crayon (1) = 5 value — even split. If you&#x27;d prefer a bit more for yourself, we could do chalk + 1 crayon for me and you take both bolts + 2 crayons (I get 4, you get 6). Which do you prefer?</p>
