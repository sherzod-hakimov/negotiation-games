You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

        <p>Hi — glad to negotiate. Quick check: do you have any strong preference rankings among the items (bowl, bottle, fruits, eraser)? I value bowl and bottle much more than fruits/eraser, so if one of those is important to you I’m open to trading for both fruits or other concessions. Otherwise I’d prefer to take one of the high-value items. What do you most want?</p>

        <p>I can take both fruits and the eraser — that gives me 3+3+3 = 9 points. Either the bowl or the bottle is fine to give you; I value the bowl 1 and the bottle 0, so I&#x27;d prefer you take the bottle (so I keep the bowl), but either works for me.
