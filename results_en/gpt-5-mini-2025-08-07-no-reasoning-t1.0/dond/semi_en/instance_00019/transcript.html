        <p>You are playing a negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>2 threads, 3 bolts, 1 picture<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>thread: 0, bolt: 1, picture: 7<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message.

        <p>Hi — want to split items cooperatively. Quick idea: I value the picture a lot (most of my worth). How important is the picture to you? If you want it, I&#x27;m happy to take bolts and give you the picture; otherwise we can split so both get good value.<br/><br/>Options I propose for a fair deal:<br/>- If you want the picture, take the picture and one bolt, I take 2 bolts and 2 threads (but there are only 2 threads and 3 bolts — adjust if you prefer a different bolt split).<br/>- If you don&#x27;t need the picture, we can split bolts and threads: maybe you take 2 bolts + picture, I take 1 bolt + 2 threads — or you take picture + 0 bolts and I take all bolts/threads.<br/><br/>Tell me which option you&#x27;d prefer or what you value most and we’ll finalize.</p>

        <p>Thanks — I want to reach a deal quickly.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t care much about bolts; threads and the picture matter more to me. I prefer getting the picture if possible. Here are two simple options I can accept:<br/><br/>1) You take the picture and 1 bolt; I take 2 threads and 2 bolts. (That uses 1 picture, 2 threads, 3 bolts.)<br/><br/>2) You take the picture and 0 bolts; I take 2 threads and all 3 bolts.<br/><br/>If neither works for you, tell me which items you most want (picture / threads / bolts) and a counteroffer.</p>

        <p>Thanks — I appreciate the quick options. I highly value the picture most, then bolts, and don&#x27;t care about threads (threads = 0 for me). Your options both give you the picture; both could work but I prefer maximizing my bolts since bolts have value 1 each to me.<br/><br/>I can accept option 1: you get 2 threads and 2 bolts; I take the picture and 1 bolt. That gives me picture (7) + 1 bolt (1) = 8 points, and you get 2 bolts (2) + threads (0) + picture? Wait—option 1 you proposed gives you the picture; to be clear: option 1 was &quot;You take the picture and 1 bolt; I take 2 threads and 2 bolts.&quot; That allocation is fine.<br/><br/>If you&#x27;d rather take all 3 bolts with the picture, option 2 gives me picture + 0 bolts = 7; option 1 gives me 8. So I prefer option 1.<br/><br/>If you agree, I&#x27;ll submit a secret proposal now. If you reject, propose which option you prefer.</p>
