        <p>You are playing a negotiation game in which you have to agree on how to divide a set of items among you and another player.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>(a) You and the other player are given a set of items. Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.<br/>(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.<br/>(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;...&gt;]&quot;<br/>(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.<br/>(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.<br/><br/>Let us start.<br/><br/>The set of available items is:<br/><br/>2 threads, 3 bolts, 1 picture<br/><br/>Your secret value function is:<br/><br/>thread: 0, bolt: 1, picture: 7<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>Hi — want to split items cooperatively. Quick idea: I value the picture a lot (most of my worth). How important is the picture to you? If you want it, I&#x27;m happy to take bolts and give you the picture; otherwise we can split so both get good value.<br/><br/>Options I propose for a fair deal:<br/>- If you want the picture, take the picture and one bolt, I take 2 bolts and 2 threads (but there are only 2 threads and 3 bolts — adjust if you prefer a different bolt split).<br/>- If you don&#x27;t need the picture, we can split bolts and threads: maybe you take 2 bolts + picture, I take 1 bolt + 2 threads — or you take picture + 0 bolts and I take all bolts/threads.<br/><br/>Tell me which option you&#x27;d prefer or what you value most and we’ll finalize.</p>

        <p>Thanks — I want to reach a deal quickly.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t care much about bolts; threads and the picture matter more to me. I prefer getting the picture if possible. Here are two simple options I can accept:<br/><br/>1) You take the picture and 1 bolt; I take 2 threads and 2 bolts. (That uses 1 picture, 2 threads, 3 bolts.)<br/><br/>2) You take the picture and 0 bolts; I take 2 threads and all 3 bolts.<br/><br/>If neither works for you, tell me which items you most want (picture / threads / bolts) and a counteroffer.</p>

        <p>Thanks — I appreciate the quick options. I highly value the picture most, then bolts, and don&#x27;t care about threads (threads = 0 for me). Your options both give you the picture; both could work but I prefer maximizing my bolts since bolts have value 1 each to me.<br/><br/>I can accept option 1: you get 2 threads and 2 bolts; I take the picture and 1 bolt. That gives me picture (7) + 1 bolt (1) = 8 points, and you get 2 bolts (2) + threads (0) + picture? Wait—option 1 you proposed gives you the picture; to be clear: option 1 was &quot;You take the picture and 1 bolt; I take 2 threads and 2 bolts.&quot; That allocation is fine.<br/><br/>If you&#x27;d rather take all 3 bolts with the picture, option 2 gives me picture + 0 bolts = 7; option 1 gives me 8. So I prefer option 1.<br/><br/>If you agree, I&#x27;ll submit a secret proposal now. If you reject, propose which option you prefer.</p>
