        <p>Hi — nice to work with you. There are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork.<br/><br/>Quick idea: I value scissors highly (3 each), fork a little (1), and thimble not at all. To maximize total joint score, best to give scissors to whoever values them most and assign the fork as useful; the thimble can go to whoever doesn&#x27;t care.<br/><br/>What&#x27;s your valuation for each item? Then we can split so each of us gets items we value.</p>

        <p>Hi! Nice to work with you. I value items differently, but I prefer to ask a few quick questions to find an efficient split.<br/><br/>Could you tell me (roughly) how much you value each item type on a scale like 0–6? Even just ranking them (most to least) is fine. Once I know that, I can propose a split that maximizes our total score.</p>

        <p>Sure — quick ranking: scissors (most), fork (next), thimble (least). On a 0–6 scale: scissors 3, fork 1, thimble 0.<br/><br/>Given that, a high-total plan is to give scissors to whoever values them most. How many scissors would you like (0–3)? Also, do you value the fork more than a single scissors? If so, tell me your values so we can finalize a complementary proposal.</p>

        <p>Thanks — that helps a lot.<br/><br/>I value scissors 1 each, fork 1, thimble 6 (on a 0–6 scale). So the thimble is very valuable to me; scissors and fork I value equally and much less.<br/><br/>Given your values (scissors 3, fork 1, thimble 0) and mine, the efficient allocation to maximize total value is:<br/>- Give the thimble to me (worth 6 to me, 0 to you).<br/>- Give as many scissors as possible to you, since you value them 3 and I value them 1.<br/>- The fork is worth 1 to each of us, so it can go to either without changing total value.<br/><br/>There are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork. To maximize total:<br/>- You get all 3 scissors (3 * 3 = 9 for you).<br/>- I get the thimble (6 for me).<br/>- The fork can go to either; it adds +1 regardless.<br/><br/>Total maximum joint value = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16.<br/><br/>Would you prefer to take the fork as well (so you get 3 scissors + fork = 10, I get thimble = 6), or should I take the fork (you 9, me 7)? I&#x27;m indifferent between those two. Once you pick, I can make a secret proposal or we can both submit complementary proposals.</p>
