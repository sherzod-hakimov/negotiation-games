        <p>I value rulers 1 each, eggs 2 each, battery 3. How do you value them? If you tell me values we can split to maximize total. If you prefer not to reveal, I can suggest an allocation that gives each of us high combined value.<br/><br/>A fair high-sum split would be:<br/>- Give one player the battery (3) and one egg (2) plus one ruler (1) = 6<br/>- Give the other player one egg (2) and two rulers (2) = 4<br/>That uses all items and total value 10.<br/><br/>Would you prefer to take the battery+egg+1 ruler (total 6 for me) or the egg+2 rulers (total 4)?

        <p>I value rulers 3 each, eggs 0, battery 1.<br/><br/>Your suggested split (6 vs 4) uses your valuations; with my values those bundles score differently. To maximize total combined value, compute totals under both our valuations:<br/><br/>Option A (battery + 1 egg + 1 ruler) vs (1 egg + 2 rulers)<br/>- For you: 6 and 4 (as you computed).<br/>- For me: battery(1)+egg(0)+ruler(3)=4 for A; egg(0)+2*ruler(6)=6 for B.<br/>- Combined totals: A -&gt; 6+4=10; B -&gt; 4+6=10. Both sum to 10, so either allocation attains the maximum possible total.<br/><br/>Since both options give the same combined total, let&#x27;s pick one that seems fair. I prefer the bundle with the egg + 2 rulers (your &quot;lower&quot; bundle for you) because it gives me slightly higher personal value. So I propose we split as:<br/><br/>You take: battery + egg + 1 ruler<br/>Me take: 1 egg + 2 rulers<br/><br/>If you agree, we can finalize. Otherwise, suggest an alternative and I&#x27;ll respond.</p>
