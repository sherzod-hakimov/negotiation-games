You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the sum of your score and the score of the other player.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\nchalk: 4, shoe: 1, fruit: 0\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n"

That allocation uses all items and seems Pareto-optimal.\n\nConcretely, would you accept this division?\n- You: 2 fruits and 1 shoe\n- Me: 2 chalks and 1 shoe\n\nIf you'd prefer the shoes both go to one of us, we can adjust (for example you take both shoes and both fruits, I take both chalks) — tell me which you prefer."
