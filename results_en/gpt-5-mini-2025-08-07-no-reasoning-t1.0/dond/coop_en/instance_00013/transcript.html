        <p>Hi — nice to play together! Quick check: we each get some subset of the items (1 pen, 1 flower, 3 frames). I care about the pen (value 4) and frames (value 2 each); flower is worthless to me. What&#x27;s most important to you? If you tell me your preferences, we can split to maximize our combined score.</p>

        <p>Nice to meet you! I care most about the flower and then the pen; frames are least important to me. If we want to maximize combined value, a simple efficient split would be for you to take the item I value most (the flower) and I take items you value most (the pen and possibly frames) depending on how we score.<br/><br/>One proposal that seems likely to be Pareto-optimal: you take the flower; I take the pen and one or two frames depending on your needs. What would you prefer?</p>

        <p>Thanks — that sounds cooperative. I value the pen (4) and frames (2 each); I don&#x27;t care about the flower. So the efficient allocation is: you get the flower, I get the pen, and the frames can be split to maximize total value.<br/><br/>Total item values from my side: pen 4 + 3 frames *2 = 6 -&gt; total 10 (flower 0). From your description you value the flower most and pen next; frames least. To maximize combined score, all items should be allocated (no waste). I prefer taking the pen and one frame (pen + 1 frame = 6 for me), leaving you the flower and two frames. But if you value frames very little, giving me extra frames increases total only if you value them less than I do — which you implied.<br/><br/>Are you happy with: you get the flower + 1 frame + 1 frame (2 frames), and I get the pen + 1 frame? If yes, shall we lock that in? If you prefer fewer frames for me, tell me and we can adjust.</p>
