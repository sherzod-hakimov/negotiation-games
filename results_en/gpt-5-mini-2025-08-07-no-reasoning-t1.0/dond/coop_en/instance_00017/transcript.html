        <p>Hi — we should split the items so each of us gets value and total sum is maximized. For me, pot and plate are valuable (I value pot=5, plate=5), magnets are worthless to me. How do you value them? If you also value pot or plate highly, maybe I can take magnets and one of pot/plate. What&#x27;s your preference?</p>

        <p>Thanks — good idea to maximize total. I value pot at 4, each magnet at 2, plate at 0. So my total value for all items is 4 + 3*2 + 0 = 10.<br/><br/>Given your values (pot=5, plate=5, magnets=0), your total for all items is 10 as well.<br/><br/>To maximize combined value, we should give each item to the person who values it more. You value plate much more (5 vs my 0), and you value pot slightly more (5 vs my 4). I value magnets (2 each) and you value them 0.<br/><br/>So the efficient division is:<br/>- You get pot and plate.<br/>- I get the 3 magnets.<br/><br/>This yields scores: you 5+5=10, me 3*2=6, combined 16. Any other distribution gives a lower total (for example if you took magnets instead of one high-value item the total would drop).<br/><br/>Does that division work for you? If you&#x27;d prefer a more balanced split of points rather than strictly maximizing total, tell me a trade (e.g., one magnet to you in exchange for something) and we can adjust.</p>
