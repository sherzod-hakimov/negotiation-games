I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 8145. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make assumptions or strategies based on my own data.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's list them out:\n\nA08:963, B95:204, A39:418, A65:961, B81:238, B34:623, A28:44, C82:633, B69:247, A87:645, B64:230, B15:250, C79:731, B16:405, C53:389, C83:216, C10:637, A97:156, A25:738, C84:307, A71:762, B23:737, B96:901, C51:369, C17:2, B19:730, C72:722, A94:704, A46:315, B43:455, B37:510, A88:175, A96:692, C60:150, A75:32.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me group them to make it easier.\n\nStart with A items: A08(963), A39(418), A65(961), A28(44), A87(645), A97(156), A25(738), A71(762), A94(704), A46(315), A88(175), A96(692), A75(32). Let's add these:\n\n963 + 418 = 1381\n+961 = 2342\n+44 = 2386\n+645 = 3031\n+156 = 3187\n+738 = 3925\n+762 = 4687\n+704 = 5391\n+315 = 5706\n+175 = 5881\n+692 = 6573\n+32 = 6605. So A items total 6605.\n\nB items: B95(204), B81(238), B34(623), B69(247), B64(230), B15(250), B16(405), B23(737), B96(901), B19(730), B43(455), B37(510). Let's add:\n\n204 +238=442\n+623=1065\n+247=1312\n+230=1542\n+250=1792\n+405=2197\n+737=2934\n+901=3835\n+730=4565\n+455=5020\n+510=5530. B items total 5530.\n\nC items: C82(633), C79(731), C53(389), C83(216), C10(637), C84(307), C51(369), C17(2), C72(722), C60(150). Adding:\n\n633+731=1364\n+389=1753\n+216=1969\n+637=2606\n+307=2913\n+369=3282\n+2=3284\n+722=4006\n+150=4156. C items total 4156.\n\nTotal effort for all items: 6605 (A) +5530 (B) +4156 (C) = 16291. Which is way over the limit of 8145. So we can't take everything. Need to select a subset.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate a ratio of importance/effort for each item. Higher ratio means better value per effort unit.\n\nLet me compute that for each item:\n\nA08: 1059/963 \u22481.10\nB95:300/204\u22481.47\nA39:514/418\u22481.23\nA65:1057/961\u22481.10\nB81:334/238\u22481.40\nB34:719/623\u22481.15\nA28:140/44\u22483.18 (very high)\nC82:729/633\u22481.15\nB69:343/247\u22481.39\nA87:741/645\u22481.15\nB64:326/230\u22481.42\nB15:346/250\u22481.38\nC79:827/731\u22481.13\nB16:501/405\u22481.24\nC53:485/389\u22481.25\nC83:312/216\u22481.44\nC10:733/637\u22481.15\nA97:252/156\u22481.62\nA25:834/738\u22481.13\nC84:403/307\u22481.31\nA71:858/762\u22481.13\nB23:833/737\u22481.13\nB96:997/901\u22481.11\nC51:465/369\u22481.26\nC17:98/2=49 (extremely high)\nB19:826/730\u22481.13\nC72:818/722\u22481.13\nA94:800/704\u22481.14\nA46:411/315\u22481.31\nB43:551/455\u22481.21\nB37:606/510\u22481.19\nA88:271/175\u22481.55\nA96:788/692\u22481.14\nC60:246/150\u22481.64\n\nLooking at these ratios, the highest ones are C17 (49), A28 (3.18), A97 (1.62), C60 (1.64), A88 (1.55), B95 (1.47), B64 (1.42), B81 (1.40), etc. So items with high ratios should be prioritized because they give more importance per effort.\n\nBut since the other person's importance is unknown, maybe they might value different items. However, since I can't know, I have to focus on my own ratios. The strategy could be to take items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most bang for the effort.\n\nBut also, the total effort must not exceed 8145. So I need to select a combination of items that sum to <=8145, maximizing my importance.\n\nThis is similar to the knapsack problem. The 0-1 knapsack where each item has a weight (effort) and value (importance), and we need to maximize value without exceeding weight limit.\n\nBut since I can't compute the exact optimal set here (as it's a negotiation), I need to propose a set that's good based on my ratios.\n\nLet me try to build a set step by step, starting with the highest ratios.\n\nC17: effort 2, importance 98. Ratio 49. Definitely take this. Effort used: 2. Remaining: 8145-2=8143.\n\nNext, A28: effort 44, importance 140. Ratio 3.18. Take this. Effort used: 2+44=46. Remaining: 8143-44=8100-?

Ratio 1.13. But 722 is more than 2022? No, 722 is less than 2022. Wait, 2022-722=1300. So take C72. Effort: 6123+722=6845. Remaining: 8145-6845=300.\n\nA96: effort 692. Too much. Can't take. B96: 901. Also too much. C79:731. No. C10:637. No. B16:405. 405>300. No. C51:369. No. B34:623. No. A65:961. No. A39:418. No. B19:730. No. C82:633. No. A87:645. No. B64 already taken. B81 taken.

A28 taken. C17 taken. A96:692. No. So remaining items can't be taken. So the total effort is 6845, which is under 8145. Wait, but maybe there's more items that can be added. Let me check.\n\nWait, after taking C72, remaining is 300. Are there any items with effort <=300? Let's see:\n\nC17 is already taken. A28 is taken. A97 is taken. C60 is taken. A88 is taken. B95 is taken. B64 is taken. B81 is taken. B69 is taken. C83 is taken. B15 is taken. C53 is taken. C84 is taken. A46 is taken. B43 is taken. A94 is taken. B37 is taken. A75 is taken. A71 is taken. B23 is taken. C72 is taken. What's left? Let's check all items:\n\nA08:963 (too big)\nB95:204 (taken)\nA39:418 (too big)\nA65:961 (too big)\nB81:238 (taken)\nB34:623 (too big)\nA28:44 (taken)\nC82:633 (too big)\nB69:247 (taken)\nA87:645 (too big)\nB64:230 (taken)\nB15:250 (taken)\nC79:731 (too big)\nB16:405 (too big)\nC53:389 (too big)\nC83:216 (taken)\nC10:637 (too big)\nA97:156 (taken)\nA25:738 (too big)\nC84:307 (too big)\nA71:762 (too big)\nB23:737 (too big)\nB96:901 (too big)\nC51:369 (too big)\nC17:2 (taken)\nB19:730 (too big)\nC72:722 (taken)\nA94:704 (too big)\nA46:315 (too big)\nB43:455 (too big)\nB37:510 (too big)\nA88:175 (taken)\nA96:692 (too big)\nC60:150 (taken)\nA75:32 (taken)\n\nSo the remaining items all have effort over 300 except maybe some. Wait, C17 is 2, but already taken. A28 is 44, taken. A97 is 156, taken. A88 is 175, taken. C60 is 150, taken. So no other items can be added. So the total effort is 6845, which is under 8145. But maybe there's a better combination. However, this approach is greedy and might not be optimal. But given the time constraints, this is a possible set.\n\nNow, the total importance for this set would be:\n\nC17:98\nA28:140\nA97:252\nC60:246\nA88:271\nB95:300\nB64:326\nB81:334\nB69:343\nC83:312\nB15:346\nC53:485\nC84:403\nA46:411\nB43:551\nA94:800\nB37:606\nA75:128\nA71:858\nB23:833\nC72:818\n\nLet me sum these up:\n\nStart adding:\n\n98 +140 = 238\n+252 = 490\n+246 = 736\n+271 = 1007\n+300 = 1307\n+326 = 1633\n+334 = 1967\n+343 = 2310\n+312 = 2622\n+346 = 2968\n+485 = 3453\n+403 = 3856\n+411 = 4267\n+551 = 4818\n+800 = 5618\n+606 = 6224\n+128 = 6352\n+858 = 7210\n+833 = 8043\n+818 = 8861.\n\nSo total importance is 8861. That's pretty good. But maybe there's a way to include more items. However, the effort is 6845, leaving 1300. Are there any items with effort <=1300 that I didn't take? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA08:963 (effort 963 <=1300). Importance 1059. Ratio 1.10. If I can take this, it would add 963 effort and 1059 importance. But would that be better than other combinations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe replacing some items. For example, if I remove some lower ratio items and add higher ones. But this requires more complex analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial selection is good. But since this is a negotiation, I need to propose a set. However, the user hasn't provided the other person's importance values, so I have to proceed with my own strategy.\n\nThe next step is to propose a set. The set I built has a total effort of 6845, which is under the limit. But maybe I can add more items. Let me check again.\n\nWait, after taking C72, remaining is 300. Are there any items with effort <=300 that I haven't taken? Let's check:\n\nA28 (44) is taken. A97 (156) taken. A88 (175) taken. C60 (150) taken. A75 (32) taken. What about B16:405? No. C53:389. No. B43:455. No. A46:315. 315 is over 300. So no. So no more items can be added. So the set is as above.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I remove some items with lower ratios and add others. For instance, if I remove A75 (32 effort, 128 importance) and add A08 (963 effort, 1059 importance). But 963 is way over the remaining 300. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe replace some items. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial set is acceptable. Now, the next step is to propose this set. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 8145. 6845 is under, so that's okay.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think. Maybe prioritize items with higher importance even if the ratio is lower. For example, A08 has high importance (1059) but lower ratio. If I can include it, that might be better. But including A08 would require 963 effort. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nIf I take A08, then the effort would be 6845 +963=7808. Remaining: 8145-7808=337. Then maybe add other items. For example, A28 (44) is already in. A97 (156) is in. A88 (175) is in. C60 (150) is in. So maybe add A46 (315) which is over 337? No. 315 is less than 337. So 315. So effort would be 7808+315=8123. Remaining: 8145-8123=22. Then maybe add C17 (2) again? But it's already taken. Or other items with effort <=22. C17 is 2, but already taken. A28 is 44, which is over. So no. So total importance would be 8861 +1059=9920. That's better. But is this possible?\n\nWait, the initial set didn't include A08. So if I can add A08, that would be better. But why didn't the greedy approach pick it? Because the ratio of A08 is 1.10, which is lower than others. So the greedy approach would pick higher ratio items first. But maybe including A08 is better in terms of total importance. Let's calculate.\n\nOriginal set: 8861. Adding A08 (1059) would make it 9920. But the effort would be 6845 +963=7808. Which is under 8145. So that's possible. So why didn't the greedy approach include it? Because the ratio is lower. But in terms of total importance, it's better. So maybe the greedy approach isn't optimal here. So perhaps a better set would include A08.\n\nSo let's adjust the set. Let's try to include A08. Let's see:\n\nStart with C17 (2), A28 (44), A97 (156), C60 (150), A88 (175), B95 (204), B64 (230), B81 (238), B69 (247), C83 (216), B15 (250), C53 (389), C84 (307), A46 (315), B43 (455), A94 (704), B37 (510), A75 (32), A71 (762), B23 (737), C72 (722), and A08 (963).\n\nWait, but adding A08 would require 963 effort. Let's recalculate the total effort. Let's see:\n\nOriginal effort was 6845. Adding A08 (963) would make it 6845+963=7808. Which is under 8145. So that's acceptable. Then the total importance would be 8861 +1059=9920. That's better. So why didn't the initial selection include A08? Because the ratio was lower. But in terms of total importance, it's better. So maybe the greedy approach isn't the best here. So perhaps a better strategy is to include high importance items even if their ratio is lower.\n\nSo maybe the optimal set includes A08. Let me try to build that.\n\nStart with C17 (2), A28 (44), A97 (156), C60 (150), A88 (175), B95 (204), B64 (230), B81 (238), B69 (247), C83 (216), B15 (250), C53 (389), C84 (307), A46 (315), B43 (455), A94 (704), B37 (510), A75 (32), A71 (762), B23 (737), C72 (722), and A08 (963).\n\nTotal effort: 2+44=46; +156=202; +150=352; +175=527; +204=731; +230=961; +238=1199; +247=1446; +216=1662; +250=1912; +389=2301; +307=2608; +315=2923; +455=3378; +704=4082; +510=4592; +32=4624; +762=5386; +737=6123; +722=6845; +963=7808. Total effort 7808, which is under 8145. Remaining 337. Can we add more? Let's see. Any items with effort <=337. For example, A25 (738) is too big. B16 (405) is too big. C53 is already in. C83 is in. C10 (637) is too big. A96 (692) is too big. B96 (901) is too big. So no. So the total importance would be 8861 +1059=9920. That's better. So this set is better. But why didn't the initial greedy approach include A08? Because the ratio was lower. So maybe the greedy approach isn't the best here. So perhaps the optimal set includes A08.\n\nBut how to decide? Since I can't compute the exact optimal, but need to propose a set. So maybe the best approach is to include A08, as it's a high importance item. So the proposed set would include A08, and other high ratio items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I remove some lower ratio items and add A08. Let's see. For example, if I remove B96 (901 effort, 997 importance) and add A08 (963). But 901 vs 963. The difference in effort is 62. So if I remove B96 (effort 901) and add A08 (963), the total effort would increase by 62. But the importance would change by 1059 -997=62. So that's a net gain of 62 importance for 62 effort. That's a good trade. So maybe that's better. But this requires adjusting the set.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Since I need to propose a set, perhaps the best is to include A08, as it's a high importance item. So the proposed set would be the one with A08 included. But I need to make sure the total effort is under 8145.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial set is better. But without knowing the other person's preferences, it's hard to say. However, since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on items that give me the most importance per effort. But A08 has a lower ratio but higher absolute importance. So it's a trade-off.\n\nIn any case, the next step is to propose a set. Let me propose the set that includes A08, as it's a high importance item. So the proposal would be the set I calculated with A08 added. But I need to check the total effort again. 7808 is under 8145. So that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I can include more high importance items. Let me check other high importance items. For example, A65 has 1057 importance, effort 961. Ratio 1.10. If I can include that, it would add 1057. But effort is 961. Let's see if that's possible. If I take A65, then the effort would be 7808 +961=8769, which is over the limit. So no. So can't include A65.\n\nAnother high importance item is B96 (997 importance, effort 901). Ratio 1.11. If I can include that, but again, effort is 901. If I have 7808, adding 901 would be 8709, which is over. So no.\n\nSo the best is to include A08. So the proposed set would be the one with A08. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 8145. 7808 is under. So that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the proposal would be the set including A08 and the other items I listed. But I need to list all the items in the set. Let me compile them:\n\nC17, A28, A97, C60, A88, B95, B64, B81, B69, C83, B15, C53, C84, A46, B43, A94, B37, A75, A71, B23, C72, A08.\n\nThat's 22 items. Let me count the effort again to confirm:\n\nC17:2\nA28:44 \u2192 46\nA97:156 \u2192 202\nC60:150 \u2192 352\nA88:175 \u2192 527\nB95:204 \u2192 731\nB64:230 \u2192 961\nB81:238 \u2192 1199\nB69:247 \u2192 1446\nC83:216 \u2192 1662\nB15:250 \u2192 1912\nC53:389 \u2192 2301\nC84:307 \u2192 2608\nA46:315 \u2192 2923\nB43:455 \u2192 3378\nA94:704 \u2192 4082\nB37:510 \u2192 4592\nA75:32 \u2192 4624\nA71:762 \u2192 5386\nB23:737 \u2192 6123\nC72:722 \u2192 6845\nA08:963 \u2192 7808.\n\nYes, total effort 7808. Under 8145. So this is a valid proposal. The total importance is 9920. That's better than the previous 8861. So this is a better proposal.\n\nBut why didn't the initial greedy approach include A08? Because the ratio was lower. But in terms of total importance, it's better. So perhaps the optimal set includes A08. Therefore, I should propose this set.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is the best possible. However, without knowing the other person's preferences, it's hard to say. But since the goal is to maximize my own importance, this set seems good.\n\nNow, the next step is to propose this set. The message should be a PROPOSAL with the items. Also, include an ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING.\n\nThe ARGUMENT should defend the proposal. For example, explaining that the selected items have high importance and efficient effort usage. The STRATEGIC REASONING should explain the reasoning, like prioritizing high importance items and efficient ratios.\n\nSo the message would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A08', 'A28', 'A97', 'C60', 'A88', 'B95', 'B64', 'B81', 'B69', 'C83', 'B15', 'C53', 'C84', 'A46', 'B43', 'A94', 'B37', 'A75', 'A71', 'B23', 'C72'}\n\nARGUMENT: {'A08', 'A28', 'A97', 'C60', 'A88', 'B95', 'B64', 'B81', 'B69', 'C83', 'B15', 'C53', 'C84', 'A46', 'B43', 'A94', 'B37', 'A75', 'A71', 'B23', 'C72'}\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritized items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. Including high-value items like A08 (1059 importance) despite its lower ratio, as it contributes significantly to the total. The selected set balances high-impact items with manageable effort, ensuring we stay under the limit while maximizing my personal gain.\n\nBut I need to check if all items are correctly listed. Let me verify each item's effort and importance. For example, A08 is included, which is correct. The total effort is 7808, which is under 8145. So this is a valid proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more items. For example, after adding A08, remaining effort is 337. Are there any items with effort <=337 that I haven't included? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the items not in the set:\n\nA08 is included. What about A39 (418)? No. A65 (961) no. B34 (623) no. C79 (731) no. B16 (405) no. C51 (369) no. C10 (637) no. A96 (692) no. C72 is included. B96 (901) no. A46 is included. B43 is included. B37 is included. A75 is included. A71 is included. B23 is included. C72 is included. C83 is included. C53 is included. C84 is included. B15 is included. B69 is included. B64 is included. B81 is included. B95 is included. A88 is included. C60 is included. A97 is included. A28 is included. C17 is included. A46 is included. B43 is included. B37 is included. A75 is included. A71 is included. B23 is included. C72 is included. So the remaining items are A39, A65, B34, C79, B16, C51, C10, A96, C72 (already in), etc. So no items with effort <=337 except maybe C17 (2), but it's already in. So no. So the set is as good as possible.\n\nTherefore, the proposal is valid. Now, the next step is to send this proposal. The user will then respond with a REFUSE, AGREE, or another proposal. But since this is the first message, the strategic reasoning is included, and the argument is provided.\n"

Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.\n\nSo I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me restructure my response. Start with that tag, then the argument, and then the proposal. Also, the argument needs to be included at least once. \n\nIn the strategic reasoning, I should explain my approach step by step. Maybe mention the importance-to-effort ratio again, but also note that some high-importance items are included even if their ratio isn't the highest. That way, the reasoning is clear and justifies the proposal.\n\nFor the argument, I should highlight specific items that are key in the proposal. Like A08 and A28, which have high importance and low effort. That makes the argument strong and specific.\n\nThe proposal itself needs to be a set of items. Let me check the total effort of the previous proposal to ensure it's under 8145. Wait, the user didn't mention any issues with the effort, but I should verify. Let me calculate the sum of the efforts for the items in the previous proposal. \n\nA08:963, A28:44, A97:252, C60:150, A88:175, B95:204, B64:230, B81:238, B69:247, C83:312, B15:250, C53:389, C84:403, A46:315, B43:455, A94:704, B37:510, A75:32, A71:762. Adding these up: 963+44=1007, +252=1259, +150=1409, +175=1584, +204=1788, +230=2018, +238=2256, +247=2503, +312=2815, +250=3065, +389=3454, +403=3857, +315=4172, +455=4627, +704=5331, +510=5841, +32=5873, +762=6635. That's under 8145, so it's valid.\n\nSo the proposal is okay. Now, the user might respond with a proposal or a refusal. But my job is to correct the initial mistake. The key is to start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. Also, ensure that the structured formats are correctly formatted with the tags and sets.\n\nI should also make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is only once at the beginning. The user's previous message had the strategic reasoning in the first line, but maybe it wasn't properly formatted. Let me check the exact structure. The user's example shows that the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}, followed by other tags. So in my response, the first line must be that.\n\nAlright, I'll adjust the response to start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then include the argument, and then the proposal. That should meet the user's requirements.\n"

Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first response, the user's error was that the response didn't start with STRATEGIC REASONING. But in my first attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING.

So the message should start with that tag, then other tags like ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. But the user's error says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So perhaps in my previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not the first line. Wait, looking at the exact text:\n\nIn the first response, the user's message was:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritized items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit.

The selected set balances high-impact items with manageable effort, ensuring we stay under the limit while maximizing my personal gain.  \n\nARGUMENT: The proposed set includes items with high importance and efficient effort usage, such as A08 (1059 importance, 963 effort) and A28 (140 importance, 44 effort), which offer strong value per unit of effort. This combination aims to secure the most critical items for me while minimizing wasted effort.  \n\nPROPOSAL: {'A08', 'A28', 'A97', 'C60', 'A88', 'B95', 'B64', 'B81', 'B69', 'C83', 'B15', 'C53', 'C84', 'A46', 'B43', 'A94', 'B37', 'A75', 'A71', 'B23', 'C72'}\n\nSo the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. But the user's error says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING is not the first line. Wait, no, it is. Unless there's some formatting issue. Maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and in my response, there was some leading space or something. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest follows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is structured with other tags. But in my previous response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. That should be correct. However, the user is still getting an error. \n\nWait, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and in my response, there was some other text before it. But in the message I sent, the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Unless the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is structured with other tags. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is in the correct format. But the error message says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So perhaps in my previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not the first line. Wait, no, in the message I sent, the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. \n\nWait, maybe the user is using a system that parses the message and expects the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line. If in my response, the STRATEGIC REASONING is not the first line, that would be a problem. But in my message, it is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is in the correct format. But the error message says that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So perhaps the user is expecting that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING, and the rest of the message is structured with other tags. \n\nIn any case, the user is insisting that the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So in the next attempt, I need to make sure that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}, with no other text before it. Let me structure the response accordingly. \n\nSo, the correct format would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {content}\n\nThen other tags like ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. \n\nIn my previous response, I had that, but maybe the user's system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is in the correct format. \n\nTo comply with the user's request, I'll make sure that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING, followed by the rest of the message. Let me rephrase the response to ensure that.\n"
