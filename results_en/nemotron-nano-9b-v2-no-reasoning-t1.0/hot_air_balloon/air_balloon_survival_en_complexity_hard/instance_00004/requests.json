I focused on high-ratio items like B81 (10.9), A96 (6.82), and A39 (5.95), which offer significant value per effort. This set balances high-impact items with manageable effort, leaving room for adjustments if the opponent proposes alternatives.  \n\nPROPOSAL: {'B81', 'A96', 'A39', 'A94', 'A88', 'A97', 'B23', 'A25', 'A46', 'B43', 'B37', 'C53', 'C10', 'C72', 'C84', 'C79', 'B16', 'B15', 'C51', 'C17', 'C82'}  \n\nARGUMENT: This proposal includes items with the highest personal importance relative to their effort, ensuring I maximize my total value. For example, B81 and A96 have exceptional ratios, while C82 adds substantial importance without excessive effort. The total effort (6867) is under the limit, allowing flexibility for potential compromises.\n",

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 6880. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see which ones are feasible. But since the limit is 6880, I need to prioritize items that give me the most importance per unit of effort. That's the classic knapsack problem approach. Let me compute the importance-to-effort ratio for each item.\n\nLooking at my importance and effort values:\n\nFor example, item A96 has an importance of 116 and effort 17. The ratio is 116/17 ≈ 6.82. That's pretty good. Similarly, A94 has 136/37 ≈ 3.68. B23 is 161/62 ≈ 2.59. Wait, but maybe some items have higher absolute importance even if the ratio isn't the best. But since the limit is fixed, the ratio approach is better for maximizing total importance.\n\nLet me list all items with their ratios:\n\nA08: 440/341 ≈ 1.29\nB95: 903/804 ≈ 1.12\nA39: 119/20 = 5.95\nA65: 726/627 ≈ 1.16\nB81: 109/10 = 10.9\nB34: 672/573 ≈ 1.17\nA28: 316/217 ≈ 1.46\nC82: 580/481 ≈ 1.20\nB69: 304/205 ≈ 1.48\nA87: 372/273 ≈ 1.36\nB64: 402/303 ≈ 1.33\nB15: 695/596 ≈ 1.17\nC79: 663/564 ≈ 1.18\nB16: 634/535 ≈ 1.18\nC53: 357/258 ≈ 1.38\nC83: 1010/911 ≈ 1.11\nC10: 339/240 ≈ 1.41\nA97: 287/188 ≈ 1.53\nA25: 315/216 ≈ 1.46\nC84: 500/401 ≈ 1.25\nA71: 1008/909 ≈ 1.11\nB23: 161/62 ≈ 2.59\nB96: 344/245 ≈ 1.40\nC51: 1093/994 ≈ 1.10\nC17: 668/569 ≈ 1.17\nB19: 817/718 ≈ 1.14\nC72: 563/464 ≈ 1.21\nA94: 136/37 ≈ 3.68\nA46: 439/340 ≈ 1.29\nB43: 434/335 ≈ 1.29\nB37: 516/417 ≈ 1.24\nA88: 222/123 ≈ 1.80\nA96: 116/17 ≈ 6.82\n\nSo the highest ratios are A96 (6.82), B81 (10.9), A39 (5.95), A94 (3.68), A88 (1.80), A97 (1.53), etc. Wait, B81 has a ratio of 10.9, which is the highest. That's a key item. Then A96, A39, A94. These should be prioritized.\n\nBut I need to check the total effort. Let's start adding the highest ratio items first.\n\nStart with B81 (effort 10, importance 109). Then A96 (17, 116). Then A39 (20, 119). Then A94 (37, 136). Then A88 (123, 222). Then maybe A97 (188, 287). Let's sum the efforts:\n\n10 +17=27, +20=47, +37=84, +123=207, +188=395. That's under 6880. But maybe there are more items. Let's see. Next could be A25 (216, 315) or B23 (62, 161). Wait, B23's ratio is 2.59, which is higher than some others. Let's add B23 (62). Now total effort is 395+62=457. Then maybe A25 (216) would bring it to 457+216=673. Still under. Then A46 (340) would be 673+340=1013. Still under. Then B43 (335) would be 1013+335=1348. Then B37 (417) would be 1348+417=1765. Then C53 (258) would be 1765+258=2023. Then C10 (240) is 2023+240=2263. Then C72 (464) is 2263+464=2727. Then C84 (401) is 2727+401=3128. Then C79 (564) is 3128+564=3692. Then C82 (481) is 3692+481=4173. Then C51 (994) is 4173+994=5167. Then C17 (569) is 5167+569=5736. Then B19 (718) is 5736+718=6454. Then C83 (911) would be 6454+911=7365, which exceeds the limit. So we can't take C83. Next, maybe B95 (804) would be 6454+804=7258, which is over. So stop here. The total effort is 6454, which is under 6880. The total importance would be sum of all these items' importance. But this is just my own calculation. However, the other person might have different priorities. But since I don't know their values, I have to focus on my own.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might have different importance values. For example, if they value C83 highly, but I don't. So in the negotiation, I need to propose a set that I think is good for me, but also consider that the other person might reject it if they don't get enough value. However, since I can't know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items for me, and then adjust based on their responses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by proposing a set that includes the top items by my ratio. Let's see. The top items by ratio are B81 (10.9), A96 (6.82), A39 (5.95), A94 (3.68), A88 (1.80), A97 (1.53), B23 (2.59), etc. So the initial proposal could be B81, A96, A39, A94, A88, A97, B23, A25, A46, B43, B37, C53, C10, C72, C84, C79, B16, B15, C51, C17, B19. Wait, but adding all these might exceed the limit. Let me check the total effort again.\n\nWait, earlier calculation up to B19 was 6454. Then adding C83 (911) would be over. So maybe the maximum possible is up to B19. But maybe there are other items. Let me check all items:\n\nTotal effort of all items: Let's sum all the effort values. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, since the limit is 6880, and the items I've added up to B19 are 6454, there's 6880-6454=426 left. So maybe add some more items. For example, C51 is 994, which is over. C17 is 569, which is over. B16 is 535, over. C84 is 401, which is under 426. So adding C84 would bring total to 6454+401=6855, which is under 6880. Then maybe add A75 (190) which is 6855+190=7045, over. So no. So the maximum possible is 6855. So the set would include B81, A96, A39, A94, A88, A97, B23, A25, A46, B43, B37, C53, C10, C72, C84, C79, B16, B15, C51, C17, B19. Wait, but I need to check if all these items are included. Let me list them:\n\nB81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), B19 (718). Let me sum all these efforts:\n\n10 +17=27; +20=47; +37=84; +123=207; +188=395; +62=457; +216=673; +340=1013; +335=1348; +417=1765; +258=2023; +240=2263; +464=2727; +401=3128; +564=3692; +535=4227; +596=4823; +994=5817; +569=6386; +718=7104. Oh, that's over 6880. So my previous calculation was wrong. I must have miscalculated. Let me re-calculate step by step.\n\nLet me list all the items I considered and their efforts:\n\nB81:10\n\nA96:17 → total 27\n\nA39:20 → 47\n\nA94:37 → 84\n\nA88:123 → 207\n\nA97:188 → 395\n\nB23:62 → 457\n\nA25:216 → 673\n\nA46:340 → 1013\n\nB43:335 → 1348\n\nB37:417 → 1765\n\nC53:258 → 2023\n\nC10:240 → 2263\n\nC72:464 → 2727\n\nC84:401 → 3128\n\nC79:564 → 3692\n\nB16:535 → 4227\n\nB15:596 → 4823\n\nC51:994 → 5817\n\nC17:569 → 6386\n\nB19:718 → 7104 (over)\n\nSo the total is 7104, which is over. So I need to remove some items. Let's see where to cut. The last items added are C17 (569) and B19 (718). If I remove B19 (718), the total becomes 6386. Then maybe add other items. For example, C83 (911) would be 6386+911=7297, over. C51 is 994, which is over. C10 is 240, but already included. Maybe add A71 (909) which is over. So perhaps the maximum is 6386. But that's still under 6880. Wait, 6386 is under 6880. So maybe there's more items. Let me check other items not included yet. For example, C83 (911) is over. C51 (994) is over. C17 (569) is included. What about C82 (481)? 6386 +481=6867, which is under 6880. So adding C82 would bring it to 6867. Then maybe add A75 (190) which would be 6867+190=7057, over. So the maximum possible is 6867. So the set would include C82. So the total effort is 6867, which is under 6880. So the items would be all the ones I listed up to C82. But this is a lot of items. However, the problem is that the other person might not agree to this set. But since I can't know their values, I have to propose this set as my initial proposal.\n\nBut maybe this is too many items. Alternatively, maybe I should start with a smaller set. For example, the top items by ratio. Let's see:\n\nB81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), B19 (718). But as calculated, this is over. So perhaps I need to prioritize the highest ratio items first. Let's try again, adding items in order of ratio:\n\n1. B81 (10.9) → effort 10\n2. A96 (6.82) → 17 → total 27\n3. A39 (5.95) → 20 → 47\n4. A94 (3.68) → 37 → 84\n5. A88 (1.80) → 123 → 207\n6. A97 (1.53) → 188 → 395\n7. B23 (2.59) → 62 → 457\n8. A25 (1.46) → 216 → 673\n9. A46 (1.29) → 340 → 1013\n10. B43 (1.29) → 335 → 1348\n11. B37 (1.24) → 417 → 1765\n12. C53 (1.38) → 258 → 2023\n13. C10 (1.41) → 240 → 2263\n14. C72 (1.21) → 464 → 2727\n15. C84 (1.25) → 401 → 3128\n16. C79 (1.18) → 564 → 3692\n17. B16 (1.18) → 535 → 4227\n18. B15 (1.17) → 596 → 4823\n19. C51 (1.10) → 994 → 5817\n20. C17 (1.17) → 569 → 6386\n21. B19 (1.14) → 718 → 7104 (over)\n\nSo up to C17, the total is 6386. Then adding B19 would exceed. So the maximum possible is 6386. But maybe there are other items with lower ratios that can be added. For example, C83 (1.11) is 911, which would make 6386+911=7297, over. C51 is 994, over. C10 is already included. What about C82 (1.20) → 481. 6386+481=6867. That's under. So adding C82. Then total is 6867. Then maybe add A75 (190) → 6867+190=7057, over. So the maximum is 6867. So the set would include C82. So the initial proposal could be all these items. But that's a lot. However, the other person might not agree. But since I can't know their values, I have to propose this set.\n\nBut maybe the other person has different priorities. For example, if they value C83 highly, but I don't. So in the negotiation, I need to propose a set that I think is good for me, and then adjust based on their responses. However, the first step is to make a proposal. So the first message should be a PROPOSAL with the items I think are best for me, within the limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with a smaller set. For example, the top items by ratio. Let's see:\n\nB81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), B19 (718). But as before, this is over. So perhaps I need to select a subset. Let's try to find the maximum possible items under 6880.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a knapsack algorithm. But since I can't compute it here, I'll have to approximate. Let's try to add items in order of ratio until the limit is reached.\n\nStart with B81 (10). Total effort 10. Importance 109.\n\nAdd A96 (17). Total 27. Importance 109+116=225.\n\nAdd A39 (20). Total 47. Importance 225+119=344.\n\nAdd A94 (37). Total 84. Importance 344+136=480.\n\nAdd A88 (123). Total 207. Importance 480+222=702.\n\nAdd A97 (188). Total 395. Importance 702+287=989.\n\nAdd B23 (62). Total 457. Importance 989+161=1150.\n\nAdd A25 (216). Total 673. Importance 1150+315=1465.\n\nAdd A46 (340). Total 1013. Importance 1465+439=1904.\n\nAdd B43 (335). Total 1348. Importance 1904+434=2338.\n\nAdd B37 (417). Total 1765. Importance 2338+516=2854.\n\nAdd C53 (258). Total 2023. Importance 2854+357=3211.\n\nAdd C10 (240). Total 2263. Importance 3211+339=3550.\n\nAdd C72 (464). Total 2727. Importance 3550+563=4113.\n\nAdd C84 (401). Total 3128. Importance 4113+500=4613.\n\nAdd C79 (564). Total 3692. Importance 4613+663=5276.\n\nAdd B16 (535). Total 4227. Importance 5276+634=5910.\n\nAdd B15 (596). Total 4823. Importance 5910+695=6605.\n\nAdd C51 (994). Total 5817. Importance 6605+1093=7698.\n\nAdd C17 (569). Total 6386. Importance 7698+668=8366.\n\nNow, adding B19 (718) would make 6386+718=7104, which is over. So stop here. The total effort is 6386, which is under 6880. So the set includes all these items. The total importance is 8366. But maybe there's room to add more items. Let's check the remaining items. For example, C83 (911) is over. C51 is already included. What about C82 (481)? 6386+481=6867. That's under. So adding C82 would bring total effort to 6867. Importance would be 8366 + 580 (C82's importance) = 8946. That's better. So the set would include C82. Then total effort is 6867. Then maybe add A75 (190) → 6867+190=7057, over. So no. So the maximum is 6867. So the set includes C82. So the initial proposal should be all these items. But that's a lot. However, the other person might not agree. But since I can't know their values, I have to proceed.\n\nSo the first proposal would be a set of items that includes B81, A96, A39, A94, A88, A97, B23, A25, A46, B43, B37, C53, C10, C72, C84, C79, B16, B15, C51, C17, C82. Let me check the total effort again:\n\nB81:10\n\nA96:17 → 27\n\nA39:20 → 47\n\nA94:37 → 84\n\nA88:123 → 207\n\nA97:188 → 395\n\nB23:62 → 457\n\nA25:216 → 673\n\nA46:340 → 1013\n\nB43:335 → 1348\n\nB37:417 → 1765\n\nC53:258 → 2023\n\nC10:240 → 2263\n\nC72:464 → 2727\n\nC84:401 → 3128\n\nC79:564 → 3692\n\nB16:535 → 4227\n\nB15:596 → 4823\n\nC51:994 → 5817\n\nC17:569 → 6386\n\nC82:481 → 6867\n\nYes, that's 6867, which is under 6880. So this is a valid proposal. The total importance for me is 8946. That's a good start. Now, the other person might propose a different set. But since I can't know their values, I have to proceed with this proposal. However, in the negotiation, they might reject it. But according to the rules, I need to include an ARGUMENT in my message. So in the first message, I should make a PROPOSAL and include an ARGUMENT explaining my reasoning.\n\nThe STRATEGIC REASONING should be at the beginning of each message. So the first message would have STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, and the ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance within the limit. I selected items like B81 (high ratio), A96, A39, A94, etc., which offer the best value per effort. This set totals 6867 effort, leaving room for potential additions if needed.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B81', 'A96', 'A39', 'A94', 'A88', 'A97', 'B23', 'A25', 'A46', 'B43', 'B37', 'C53', 'C10', 'C72', 'C84', 'C79', 'B16', 'B15', 'C51', 'C17', 'C82'}\n\nARGUMENT: I chose these items because they provide the highest importance per unit of effort, ensuring maximum personal benefit while staying under the limit. This approach balances high-value items with manageable effort.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the PROPOSAL is a set, and the ARGUMENT is a string. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden, so the other person doesn't see it. The ARGUMENT is visible. So the message would be structured as:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: [hidden reasoning]\n\nPROPOSAL: {...}\n\nARGUMENT: [visible explanation]\n\nSo the first message would be like that. Then, depending on the other person's response, I might need to adjust. But for the first step, this is the initial proposal.\n",

                "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 6880. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see which ones are feasible. But since the limit is 6880, I need to prioritize items that give me the most importance per unit of effort. That's the classic knapsack problem approach. Let me compute the importance-to-effort ratio for each item.\n\nLooking at my importance and effort values:\n\nFor example, item A96 has an importance of 116 and effort 17. The ratio is 116/17 ≈ 6.82. That's pretty good. Similarly, A94 has 136/37 ≈ 3.68. B23 is 161/62 ≈ 2.59. Wait, but maybe some items have higher absolute importance even if the ratio isn't the best. But since the limit is fixed, the ratio approach is better for maximizing total importance.\n\nLet me list all items with their ratios:\n\nA08: 440/341 ≈ 1.29\nB95: 903/804 ≈ 1.12\nA39: 119/20 = 5.95\nA65: 726/627 ≈ 1.16\nB81: 109/10 = 10.9\nB34: 672/573 ≈ 1.17\nA28: 316/217 ≈ 1.46\nC82: 580/481 ≈ 1.20\nB69: 304/205 ≈ 1.48\nA87: 372/273 ≈ 1.36\nB64: 402/303 ≈ 1.33\nB15: 695/596 ≈ 1.17\nC79: 663/564 ≈ 1.18\nB16: 634/535 ≈ 1.18\nC53: 357/258 ≈ 1.38\nC83: 1010/911 ≈ 1.11\nC10: 339/240 ≈ 1.41\nA97: 287/188 ≈ 1.53\nA25: 315/216 ≈ 1.46\nC84: 500/401 ≈ 1.25\nA71: 1008/909 ≈ 1.11\nB23: 161/62 ≈ 2.59\nB96: 344/245 ≈ 1.40\nC51: 1093/994 ≈ 1.10\nC17: 668/569 ≈ 1.17\nB19: 817/718 ≈ 1.14\nC72: 563/464 ≈ 1.21\nA94: 136/37 ≈ 3.68\nA46: 439/340 ≈ 1.29\nB43: 434/335 ≈ 1.29\nB37: 516/417 ≈ 1.24\nA88: 222/123 ≈ 1.80\nA96: 116/17 ≈ 6.82\n\nSo the highest ratios are A96 (6.82), B81 (10.9), A39 (5.95), A94 (3.68), A88 (1.80), A97 (1.53), etc. Wait, B81 has a ratio of 10.9, which is the highest. That's a key item. Then A96, A39, A94. These should be prioritized.\n\nBut I need to check the total effort. Let's start adding the highest ratio items first.\n\nStart with B81 (effort 10, importance 109). Then A96 (17, 116). Then A39 (20, 119). Then A94 (37, 136). Then A88 (123, 222). Then maybe A97 (188, 287). Let's sum the efforts:\n\n10 +17=27, +20=47, +37=84, +123=207, +188=395. That's under 6880. But maybe there are more items. Let's see. Next could be A25 (216, 315) or B23 (62, 161). Wait, B23's ratio is 2.59, which is higher than some others. Let's add B23 (62). Now total effort is 395+62=457. Then maybe A25 (216) would bring it to 457+216=673. Still under. Then A46 (340) would be 673+340=1013. Still under. Then B43 (335) would be 1013+335=1348. Then B37 (417) would be 1348+417=1765. Then C53 (258) would be 1765+258=2023. Then C10 (240) is 2023+240=2263. Then C72 (464) is 2263+464=2727. Then C84 (401) is 2727+401=3128. Then C79 (564) is 3128+564=3692. Then C82 (481) is 3692+481=4173. Then C51 (994) is 4173+994=5167. Then C17 (569) is 5167+569=5736. Then B19 (718) is 5736+718=6454. Then C83 (911) would be 6454+911=7365, which exceeds the limit. So we can't take C83. Next, maybe B95 (804) would be 6454+804=7258, which is over. So stop here. The total effort is 6454, which is under 6880. The total importance would be sum of all these items' importance. But this is just my own calculation. However, the other person might have different priorities. But since I don't know their values, I have to focus on my own.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might have different importance values. For example, if they value C83 highly, but I don't. So in the negotiation, I need to propose a set that I think is good for me, but also consider that the other person might reject it if they don't get enough value. However, since I can't know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items for me, and then adjust based on their responses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by proposing a set that includes the top items by my ratio. Let's see. The top items by ratio are B81 (10.9), A96 (6.82), A39 (5.95), A94 (3.68), A88 (1.80), A97 (1.53), B23 (2.59), etc. So the initial proposal could be B81, A96, A39, A94, A88, A97, B23, A25, A46, B43, B37, C53, C10, C72, C84, C79, B16, B15, C51, C17, B19. Wait, but adding all these might exceed the limit. Let me check the total effort again.\n\nWait, earlier calculation up to B19 was 6454. Then adding C83 (911) would be over. So maybe the maximum possible is up to B19. But maybe there are other items. Let me check all items:\n\nTotal effort of all items: Let's sum all the effort values. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, since the limit is 6880, and the items I've added up to B19 are 6454, there's 6880-6454=426 left. So maybe add some more items. For example, C51 is 994, which is over. C17 is 569, which is over. B16 is 535, over. C84 is 401, which is under 426. So adding C84 would bring total to 6454+401=6855, which is under 6880. Then maybe add A75 (190) which is 6855+190=7045, over. So no. So the maximum possible is 6855. So the set would include B81, A96, A39, A94, A88, A97, B23, A25, A46, B43, B37, C53, C10, C72, C84, C79, B16, B15, C51, C17, B19. Wait, but I need to check if all these items are included. Let me list them:\n\nB81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), B19 (718). Let me sum all these efforts:\n\n10 +17=27; +20=47; +37=84; +123=207; +188=395; +62=457; +216=673; +340=1013; +335=1348; +417=1765; +258=2023; +240=2263; +464=2727; +401=3128; +564=3692; +535=4227; +596=4823; +994=5817; +569=6386; +718=7104. Oh, that's over 6880. So my previous calculation was wrong. I must have miscalculated. Let me re-calculate step by step.\n\nLet me list all the items I considered and their efforts:\n\nB81:10\n\nA96:17 → total 27\n\nA39:20 → 47\n\nA94:37 → 84\n\nA88:123 → 207\n\nA97:188 → 395\n\nB23:62 → 457\n\nA25:216 → 673\n\nA46:340 → 1013\n\nB43:335 → 1348\n\nB37:417 → 1765\n\nC53:258 → 2023\n\nC10:240 → 2263\n\nC72:464 → 2727\n\nC84:401 → 3128\n\nC79:564 → 3692\n\nB16:535 → 4227\n\nB15:596 → 4823\n\nC51:994 → 5817\n\nC17:569 → 6386\n\nB19:718 → 7104 (over)\n\nSo the total is 7104, which is over. So I need to remove some items. Let's see where to cut. The last items added are C17 (569) and B19 (718). If I remove B19 (718), the total becomes 6386. Then maybe add other items. For example, C83 (911) would be 6386+911=7297, over. C51 is 994, which is over. C10 is 240, but already included. Maybe add A71 (909) which is over. So perhaps the maximum is 6386. But that's still under 6880. Wait, 6386 is under 6880. So maybe there's more items. Let me check other items not included yet. For example, C83 (911) is over. C51 (994) is over. C17 (569) is included. What about C82 (481)? 6386 +481=6867, which is under 6880. So adding C82 would bring it to 6867. Then maybe add A75 (190) which would be 6867+190=7057, over. So the maximum possible is 6867. So the set would include C82. So the total effort is 6867, which is under 6880. So the items would be all the ones I listed up to C82. But this is a lot of items. However, the problem is that the other person might not agree to this set. But since I can't know their values, I have to propose this set as my initial proposal.\n\nBut maybe this is too many items. Alternatively, maybe I should start with a smaller set. For example, the top items by ratio. Let's see:\n\nB81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), B19 (718). But as calculated, this is over. So perhaps I need to prioritize the highest ratio items first. Let's try again, adding items in order of ratio:\n\n1. B81 (10.9) → effort 10\n2. A96 (6.82) → 17 → total 27\n3. A39 (5.95) → 20 → 47\n4. A94 (3.68) → 37 → 84\n5. A88 (1.80) → 123 → 207\n6. A97 (1.53) → 188 → 395\n7. B23 (2.59) → 62 → 457\n8. A25 (1.46) → 216 → 673\n9. A46 (1.29) → 340 → 1013\n10. B43 (1.29) → 335 → 1348\n11. B37 (1.24) → 417 → 1765\n12. C53 (1.38) → 258 → 2023\n13. C10 (1.41) → 240 → 2263\n14. C72 (1.21) → 464 → 2727\n15. C84 (1.25) → 401 → 3128\n16. C79 (1.18) → 564 → 3692\n17. B16 (1.18) → 535 → 4227\n18. B15 (1.17) → 596 → 4823\n19. C51 (1.10) → 994 → 5817\n20. C17 (1.17) → 569 → 6386\n21. B19 (1.14) → 718 → 7104 (over)\n\nSo up to C17, the total is 6386. Then adding B19 would exceed. So the maximum possible is 6386. But maybe there are other items with lower ratios that can be added. For example, C83 (1.11) is 911, which would make 6386+911=7297, over. C51 is 994, over. C10 is already included. What about C82 (1.20) → 481. 6386+481=6867. That's under. So adding C82. Then total is 6867. Then maybe add A75 (190) → 6867+190=7057, over. So the maximum is 6867. So the set would include C82. So the initial proposal could be all these items. But that's a lot. However, the other person might not agree. But since I can't know their values, I have to propose this set.\n\nBut maybe the other person has different priorities. For example, if they value C83 highly, but I don't. So in the negotiation, I need to propose a set that I think is good for me, and then adjust based on their responses. However, the first step is to make a proposal. So the first message should be a PROPOSAL with the items I think are best for me, within the limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with a smaller set. For example, the top items by ratio. Let's see:\n\nB81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), B19 (718). But as before, this is over. So perhaps I need to select a subset. Let's try to find the maximum possible items under 6880.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a knapsack algorithm. But since I can't compute it here, I'll have to approximate. Let's try to add items in order of ratio until the limit is reached.\n\nStart with B81 (10). Total effort 10. Importance 109.\n\nAdd A96 (17). Total 27. Importance 109+116=225.\n\nAdd A39 (20). Total 47. Importance 225+119=344.\n\nAdd A94 (37). Total 84. Importance 344+136=480.\n\nAdd A88 (123). Total 207. Importance 480+222=702.\n\nAdd A97 (188). Total 395. Importance 702+287=989.\n\nAdd B23 (62). Total 457. Importance 989+161=1150.\n\nAdd A25 (216). Total 673. Importance 1150+315=1465.\n\nAdd A46 (340). Total 1013. Importance 1465+439=1904.\n\nAdd B43 (335). Total 1348. Importance 1904+434=2338.\n\nAdd B37 (417). Total 1765. Importance 2338+516=2854.\n\nAdd C53 (258). Total 2023. Importance 2854+357=3211.\n\nAdd C10 (240). Total 2263. Importance 3211+339=3550.\n\nAdd C72 (464). Total 2727. Importance 3550+563=4113.\n\nAdd C84 (401). Total 3128. Importance 4113+500=4613.\n\nAdd C79 (564). Total 3692. Importance 4613+663=5276.\n\nAdd B16 (535). Total 4227. Importance 5276+634=5910.\n\nAdd B15 (596). Total 4823. Importance 5910+695=6605.\n\nAdd C51 (994). Total 5817. Importance 6605+1093=7698.\n\nAdd C17 (569). Total 6386. Importance 7698+668=8366.\n\nNow, adding B19 (718) would make 6386+718=7104, which is over. So stop here. The total effort is 6386, which is under 6880. So the set includes all these items. The total importance is 8366. But maybe there's room to add more items. Let's check the remaining items. For example, C83 (911) is over. C51 is already included. What about C82 (481)? 6386+481=6867. That's under. So adding C82 would bring total effort to 6867. Importance would be 8366 + 580 (C82's importance) = 8946. That's better. So the set would include C82. Then total effort is 6867. Then maybe add A75 (190) → 6867+190=7057, over. So no. So the maximum is 6867. So the set includes C82. So the initial proposal should be all these items. But that's a lot. However, the other person might not agree. But since I can't know their values, I have to proceed.\n\nSo the first proposal would be a set of items that includes B81, A96, A39, A94, A88, A97, B23, A25, A46, B43, B37, C53, C10, C72, C84, C79, B16, B15, C51, C17, C82. Let me check the total effort again:\n\nB81:10\n\nA96:17 → 27\n\nA39:20 → 47\n\nA94:37 → 84\n\nA88:123 → 207\n\nA97:188 → 395\n\nB23:62 → 457\n\nA25:216 → 673\n\nA46:340 → 1013\n\nB43:335 → 1348\n\nB37:417 → 1765\n\nC53:258 → 2023\n\nC10:240 → 2263\n\nC72:464 → 2727\n\nC84:401 → 3128\n\nC79:564 → 3692\n\nB16:535 → 4227\n\nB15:596 → 4823\n\nC51:994 → 5817\n\nC17:569 → 6386\n\nC82:481 → 6867\n\nYes, that's 6867, which is under 6880. So this is a valid proposal. The total importance for me is 8946. That's a good start. Now, the other person might propose a different set. But since I can't know their values, I have to proceed with this proposal. However, in the negotiation, they might reject it. But according to the rules, I need to include an ARGUMENT in my message. So in the first message, I should make a PROPOSAL and include an ARGUMENT explaining my reasoning.\n\nThe STRATEGIC REASONING should be at the beginning of each message. So the first message would have STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, and the ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance within the limit. I selected items like B81 (high ratio), A96, A39, A94, etc., which offer the best value per effort. This set totals 6867 effort, leaving room for potential additions if needed.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B81', 'A96', 'A39', 'A94', 'A88', 'A97', 'B23', 'A25', 'A46', 'B43', 'B37', 'C53', 'C10', 'C72', 'C84', 'C79', 'B16', 'B15', 'C51', 'C17', 'C82'}\n\nARGUMENT: I chose these items because they provide the highest importance per unit of effort, ensuring maximum personal benefit while staying under the limit.

Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.\n\nSo I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING with the content. The user is strict about the structure. Let me adjust that. Also, the user mentioned that the strategic reasoning should be hidden and not shared with the other participant, but I need to include it in my message.\n\nIn my first attempt, I had the strategic reasoning but maybe it wasn't the first thing. Let me restructure the response. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then the proposal, then the argument. Also, ensure that the argument is included at least once. The user also requires that the content handed to the other player is non-empty, which it is.\n\nAnother thing to check: the proposal's total effort must be under 6880. Let me calculate the effort for the proposed items. The items are B81 (10), A96 (17), A39 (20), A94 (37), A88 (123), A97 (188), B23 (62), A25 (216), A46 (340), B43 (335), B37 (417), C53 (258), C10 (240), C72 (464), C84 (401), C79 (564), B16 (535), B15 (596), C51 (994), C17 (569), C82 (481). Adding these up: 10+17=27, +20=47, +37=84, +123=207, +188=395, +62=457, +216=673, +340=1013, +335=1348, +417=1765, +258=2023, +240=2263, +464=2727, +401=3128, +564=3692, +535=4227, +596=4823, +994=5817, +569=6386, +481=6867. Total is 6867, which is under 6880. So that's good.\n\nThe argument should defend the proposal. The user wants to see that I'm maximizing my importance. The items selected have high importance-to-effort ratios. For example, B81 (109/10=10.9), A96 (116/17≈6.82), A39 (119/20=5.95), etc. These are good choices. Also, including C82 (580/481≈1.206) might be a bit lower, but maybe it's necessary to reach the limit or because of other factors. Wait, but C82's ratio is lower. Maybe I should check if there are better items. However, the total effort is under the limit, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, maybe I can replace some lower ratio items with higher ones if possible. But given the initial selection, it's a valid approach.\n\nThe user also mentioned that the strategic reasoning should be step-by-step. So in the strategic reasoning, I should explain the process of selecting items based on the ratio, maybe prioritizing the highest ratios first, then filling in with others. That makes sense. So the strategic reasoning should outline that method.\n\nI need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first part of the message. Let me reformat the response accordingly. Also, check that all structured formats are correctly used. The proposal is a set, the argument is a string, etc.\n\nAnother thing: the user said that the strategic reasoning is hidden, so I can include my own importance values there. But in the argument, I shouldn't reveal them. So in the strategic reasoning, I can mention that I'm using my own importance values to calculate ratios, but in the argument, I just talk about the ratios without specifics.\n\nAlright, putting it all together. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then the proposal, then the argument. Make sure the argument is included. Also, check for any other rules. The user must include ARGUMENT at least once, which I did. The strategic reasoning is only once at the beginning. Looks good.\n",

Let me look at the exact structure required.\n\nThe user specified that each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} as the first line. In my previous response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING line first, but perhaps there was an issue with the formatting. Maybe the colon and whitespace weren't correct. The user's instruction says: \"A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings. So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\".\n\nIn my first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING line was correctly formatted as \"STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}\". But maybe the user is strict about the exact structure, including the colon and space. Let me verify the exact syntax. The example given is \"TAG: {...}\", so the colon must be followed by a space. In my previous response, I had \"STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}\" which should be correct. However, perhaps the user's system is sensitive to any deviation, like extra spaces or missing ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first thing in the message, with no other text before it. In my previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was the first line, so that should be okay. But perhaps the user's parser is not recognizing it because of some hidden characters or formatting issue. \n\nTo comply strictly, I need to ensure that the first line of my response is exactly \"STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}\" with the correct syntax. Let me reconstruct the response, making sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, properly formatted with the colon and space, and the set is correctly enclosed in curly braces. Also, check that there's no leading or trailing text before the STRATEGIC REASONING tag.\n\nAnother possibility is that in the previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was followed by other content, but the user wants it to be the very first part.
