I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 9322. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nA08:380, B95:448, A39:568, A65:351, B81:896, B34:821, A28:526, C82:502, B69:326, A87:962, B64:619, B15:115, C79:598, B16:662, C53:300, C83:830, C10:562, A97:679, A25:283, C84:440, A71:12, B23:863, B96:319, C51:771, C17:89, B19:655, C72:504, A94:118, A46:514, B43:226, B37:892, A88:621, A96:766, C60:659, A75:768.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd 380 (A08) \u2192 380\n\n+448 (B95) \u2192 828\n\n+568 (A39) \u2192 1396\n\n+351 (A65) \u2192 1747\n\n+896 (B81) \u2192 2643\n\n+821 (B34) \u2192 3464\n\n+526 (A28) \u2192 3990\n\n+502 (C82) \u2192 4492\n\n+326 (B69) \u2192 4818\n\n+962 (A87) \u2192 5780\n\n+619 (B64) \u2192 6399\n\n+115 (B15) \u2192 6514\n\n+598 (C79) \u2192 7112\n\n+662 (B16) \u2192 7774\n\n+300 (C53) \u2192 8074\n\n+830 (C83) \u2192 8904\n\n+562 (C10) \u2192 9466 \u2192 Oh, this is over 9322. So adding C10 would exceed the limit. So the total effort of all items is 9466, which is over the limit. Therefore, we can't take all items. So we need to select a subset.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to select items where the sum of my importance is as high as possible, but the sum of their efforts is \u22649322.\n\nBut since I don't know the other person's importance, I have to assume that they might value items differently. However, in a negotiation, perhaps I can propose items that are high in my importance but maybe not so high in theirs, or vice versa. But since I don't have their data, maybe I should focus on items that are high in my importance and have lower effort, to maximize the number of items I can take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize items with high importance per unit effort. That way, I get more value for the effort spent. Let me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item.\n\nFor example, A71 has importance 108 and effort 12. 108/12 = 9. That's a high ratio. Similarly, B15 has 211/115 \u2248 1.83. A94 has 214/118 \u2248 1.81. A25 is 379/283 \u2248 1.34. A46 is 610/514 \u2248 1.19. A96 is 862/766 \u2248 1.12. A88 is 717/621 \u2248 1.15. A08 is 476/380 \u2248 1.25. B95 is 544/448 \u2248 1.21. A39 is 664/568 \u2248 1.17. A65 is 447/351 \u2248 1.27. B81 is 992/896 \u2248 1.11. B34 is 917/821 \u2248 1.12. A28 is 622/526 \u2248 1.18. C82 is 598/502 \u2248 1.19. B69 is 422/326 \u2248 1.29. A87 is 1058/962 \u2248 1.099. B64 is 715/619 \u2248 1.15. C53 is 396/300 = 1.32. C83 is 926/830 \u2248 1.12. C10 is 658/562 \u2248 1.17. A97 is 775/679 \u2248 1.14. C84 is 536/440 \u2248 1.22. A75 is 864/768 = 1.125. C60 is 755/659 \u2248 1.145. B23 is 959/863 \u2248 1.11. B96 is 415/319 \u2248 1.30. C51 is 867/771 \u2248 1.12. C17 is 185/89 \u2248 2.08. B19 is 751/655 \u2248 1.15. C72 is 600/504 \u2248 1.19.\n\nSo the highest ratios are C17 (2.08), A71 (9), C53 (1.32), B96 (1.30), B69 (1.29), A65 (1.27), A08 (1.25), A25 (1.34), etc. Wait, A25's ratio is 379/283 \u2248 1.34. That's higher than some others. So maybe prioritizing items with high importance per effort.\n\nBut since the total effort is limited, I need to select a combination that maximizes my importance. This is similar to the knapsack problem. However, since I don't know the other person's preferences, I need to make a proposal that I think is good for me, and then negotiate.\n\nBut the first step is to make a proposal. The user's instruction says that I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING at the beginning of each message, then the ARGUMENT, and then the structured format.\n\nSo, for the first message, I need to propose a set. Let me think about which items to include.\n\nFirst, A71 has a very high importance (108) with low effort (12). That's a must-include. Then, C17 has a high ratio (2.08) with effort 89. Including that would add 185 importance for 89 effort. Then, B96 has 415 importance for 319 effort. That's a good ratio. Then, B69 (422/326 \u22481.29), A65 (447/351\u22481.27), A08 (476/380\u22481.25), A25 (379/283\u22481.34), C53 (396/300=1.32), C84 (536/440\u22481.22), A94 (214/118\u22481.81), A46 (610/514\u22481.19), A96 (862/766\u22481.12), etc.\n\nBut I need to calculate the total effort. Let's try to build a set step by step.\n\nStart with A71 (12 effort, 108 importance). Then add C17 (89, 185). Total effort so far: 12+89=101. Importance: 108+185=293.\n\nNext, add B96 (319, 415). Total effort: 101+319=420. Importance: 293+415=708.\n\nThen, B69 (326, 422). Effort: 420+326=746. Importance: 708+422=1130.\n\nA65 (351, 447). Effort: 746+351=1097. Importance: 1130+447=1577.\n\nA08 (380, 476). Effort: 1097+380=1477. Importance: 1577+476=2053.\n\nA25 (283, 379). Effort: 1477+283=1760. Importance: 2053+379=2432.\n\nC53 (300, 396). Effort: 1760+300=2060. Importance: 2432+396=2828.\n\nC84 (440, 536). Effort: 2060+440=2500. Importance: 2828+536=3364.\n\nA94 (118, 214). Effort: 2500+118=2618. Importance: 3364+214=3578.\n\nA46 (514, 610). Effort: 2618+514=3132. Importance: 3578+610=4188.\n\nA96 (766, 862). Effort: 3132+766=3898. Importance: 4188+862=5050.\n\nB23 (863, 959). Effort: 3898+863=4761. Importance: 5050+959=6009.\n\nB19 (655, 751). Effort: 4761+655=5416. Importance: 6009+751=6760.\n\nC72 (504, 600). Effort: 5416+504=5920. Importance: 6760+600=7360.\n\nC83 (830, 926). Effort: 5920+830=6750. Importance: 7360+926=8286.\n\nC82 (502, 598). Effort: 6750+502=7252. Importance: 8286+598=8884.\n\nB16 (662, 758). Effort: 7252+662=7914. Importance: 8884+758=9642.\n\nC79 (598, 694). Effort: 7914+598=8512. Importance: 9642+694=10336.\n\nC10 (562, 658). Effort: 8512+562=9074. Importance: 10336+658=10994.\n\nA97 (679, 775). Effort: 9074+679=9753. Which is over 9322. So can't add that. So stop here.\n\nWait, but 9074 is under 9322. So adding A97 would make it 9753, which is over. So we can't add A97. So the current total effort is 9074, which is under 9322. So maybe we can add more items.\n\nWhat's left? Let's check which items are not included yet. The items not in the current set are:\n\nB81 (896), B34 (821), A28 (526), C82 (502) is included? Wait, in the current set, I added C82? Wait, no. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, in the steps above, after adding C84, then A94, A46, A96, B23, B19, C72, C83, C82? Wait, no. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, in the steps I listed, after adding C84 (440 effort), then A94 (118), A46 (514), A96 (766), B23 (863), B19 (655), C72 (504), C83 (830), C82 (502). Wait, but in the steps above, I added C82 after C83? Or maybe I missed some steps. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the initial steps were:\n\nA71 (12), C17 (89), B96 (319), B69 (326), A65 (351), A08 (380), A25 (283), C53 (300), C84 (440), A94 (118), A46 (514), A96 (766), B23 (863), B19 (655), C72 (504), C83 (830), C82 (502). Wait, but in the steps I listed, after C83, I added C82. But the total effort after C83 is 6750, then adding C82 (502) would make 6750+502=7252. Then B16 (662) would be 7252+662=7914. Then C79 (598) \u2192 7914+598=8512. Then C10 (562) \u2192 8512+562=9074. Then A97 is 679, which would make 9074+679=9753, which is over. So the current set is up to C10, with total effort 9074. So there's 9322-9074=248 effort left. Are there any items left that can fit into 248?\n\nLooking at the remaining items: B81 (896), B34 (821), A28 (526), B64 (619), C51 (771), C10 is already included. Wait, C10 is included. So the remaining items are B81, B34, A28, B64, C51, and maybe others. Let's check their effort:\n\nB81: 896 (too big for 248), B34: 821 (too big), A28: 526 (too big), B64: 619 (too big), C51: 771 (too big). So none of these can be added. So the current set is 9074 effort, 10994 importance. But maybe there's a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have excluded some items to make room for others. For example, if I remove some high effort items to add others with higher importance per effort.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. However, since I need to make a proposal, I should pick a set that I think is good. Let's consider the items I have in the current set. But maybe I can optimize further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize items with the highest importance per effort. Let's sort all items by importance/effort ratio:\n\n1. A71: 108/12 = 9.0\n2. C17: 185/89 \u2248 2.08\n3. A94: 214/118 \u2248 1.81\n4. C53: 396/300 = 1.32\n5. B96: 415/319 \u2248 1.30\n6. A25: 379/283 \u2248 1.34\n7. B69: 422/326 \u2248 1.29\n8. A08: 476/380 \u2248 1.25\n9. A65: 447/351 \u2248 1.27\n10. C84: 536/440 \u2248 1.22\n11. C72: 600/504 \u2248 1.19\n12. C82: 598/502 \u2248 1.19\n13. B19: 751/655 \u2248 1.15\n14. A97: 775/679 \u2248 1.14\n15. C60: 755/659 \u2248 1.145\n16. B23: 959/863 \u2248 1.11\n17. B64: 715/619 \u2248 1.15\n18. A28: 622/526 \u2248 1.18\n19. C83: 926/830 \u2248 1.12\n20. B16: 758/662 \u2248 1.15\n21. A46: 610/514 \u2248 1.19\n22. B37: 988/892 \u2248 1.11\n23. B43: 322/226 \u2248 1.42\n24. C79: 694/598 \u2248 1.16\n25. B81: 992/896 \u2248 1.11\n26. B34: 917/821 \u2248 1.12\n\nWait, B43 has a ratio of 322/226 \u2248 1.42, which is higher than some others. So maybe I should include B43. Let me check if I included it in the previous set. In the previous steps, I didn't include B43. So maybe adding B43 would be better.\n\nSo let's try a different approach. Start with A71 (12), C17 (89), B43 (226), then others.\n\nA71 (12) + C17 (89) = 101. Then B43 (226) \u2192 101+226=327. Importance: 108+185+322=515.\n\nThen add B96 (319) \u2192 327+319=646. Importance: 515+415=930.\n\nThen B69 (326) \u2192 646+326=972. Importance: 930+422=1352.\n\nA65 (351) \u2192 972+351=1323. Importance: 1352+447=1799.\n\nA08 (380) \u2192 1323+380=1703. Importance: 1799+476=2275.\n\nA25 (283) \u2192 1703+283=1986. Importance: 2275+379=2654.\n\nC53 (300) \u2192 1986+300=2286. Importance: 2654+396=3050.\n\nC84 (440) \u2192 2286+440=2726. Importance: 3050+536=3586.\n\nA94 (118) \u2192 2726+118=2844. Importance: 3586+214=3800.\n\nA46 (514) \u2192 2844+514=3358. Importance: 3800+610=4410.\n\nA96 (766) \u2192 3358+766=4124. Importance: 4410+862=5272.\n\nB23 (863) \u2192 4124+863=4987. Importance: 5272+959=6231.\n\nB19 (655) \u2192 4987+655=5642. Importance: 6231+751=6982.\n\nC72 (504) \u2192 5642+504=6146. Importance: 6982+600=7582.\n\nC83 (830) \u2192 6146+830=6976. Importance: 7582+926=8508.\n\nC82 (502) \u2192 6976+502=7478. Importance: 8508+598=9106.\n\nB16 (662) \u2192 7478+662=8140. Importance: 9106+758=9864.\n\nC79 (598) \u2192 8140+598=8738. Importance: 9864+694=10558.\n\nC10 (562) \u2192 8738+562=9300. Importance: 10558+658=11216.\n\nNow, total effort is 9300, which is under 9322. So we have 22 left. Are there any items left that can fit? Let's check:\n\nRemaining items: B81 (896), B34 (821), A28 (526), B64 (619), C51 (771), etc. None of these can fit into 22. So the total importance is 11216. That's better than the previous 10994. So this seems better.\n\nBut this is a different combination. So the key is to select items with high importance per effort, and then fill in the remaining effort with other items.\n\nBut since I need to make a proposal, I should choose a set that I think is optimal. However, I need to make sure that the total effort is under 9322.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can include more items. Let me check the total effort of the current set: 9300. So 22 left. Maybe there's an item with effort \u226422. Looking at the list, A71 is 12, which is already included. Are there any others? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the item effort list:\n\nA71:12, C17:89, B43:226, B96:319, B69:326, A65:351, A08:380, A25:283, C53:300, C84:440, A94:118, A46:514, A96:766, B23:863, B19:655, C72:504, C83:830, C82:502, B16:662, C79:598, C10:562, B81:896, B34:821, A28:526, B64:619, C51:771, B37:892.\n\nSo the only item with effort \u226422 is A71 (12). So no other items can be added. So the current set is 9300 effort, 11216 importance. That's a good set.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some items to include others with higher importance. For instance, if I remove C10 (562 effort) and add something else. But C10's importance is 658. If I remove it, I can add other items. But with 22 left, it's not possible. So maybe this is the best possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can adjust the order. For example, instead of adding C10, maybe add another item. But with 22 left, it's not possible. So this seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, my proposal would be the set of items I've included up to C10. Let me list them:\n\nA71, C17, B43, B96, B69, A65, A08, A25, C53, C84, A94, A46, A96, B23, B19, C72, C83, C82, B16, C79, C10.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that all these items are included. Let me count them:\n\n1. A71\n2. C17\n3. B43\n4. B96\n5. B69\n6. A65\n7. A08\n8. A25\n9. C53\n10. C84\n11. A94\n12. A46\n13. A96\n14. B23\n15. B19\n16. C72\n17. C83\n18. C82\n19. B16\n20. C79\n21. C10\n\nThat's 21 items. Let me check the total effort again:\n\nA71:12\n\nC17:89 \u2192 101\n\nB43:226 \u2192 327\n\nB96:319 \u2192 646\n\nB69:326 \u2192 972\n\nA65:351 \u2192 1323\n\nA08:380 \u2192 1703\n\nA25:283 \u2192 1986\n\nC53:300 \u2192 2286\n\nC84:440 \u2192 2726\n\nA94:118 \u2192 2844\n\nA46:514 \u2192 3358\n\nA96:766 \u2192 4124\n\nB23:863 \u2192 4987\n\nB19:655 \u2192 5642\n\nC72:504 \u2192 6146\n\nC83:830 \u2192 6976\n\nC82:502 \u2192 7478\n\nB16:662 \u2192 8140\n\nC79:598 \u2192 8738\n\nC10:562 \u2192 9300\n\nYes, that's correct. Total effort 9300, which is under 9322. So this is a valid proposal.\n\nNow, the importance is 11216. That's a high value. But I need to make sure that this is the best possible. However, without knowing the other person's importance, it's hard to say. But since my goal is to maximize my own importance, this seems like a good proposal.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some items with lower importance but higher effort, and include others. But given the time constraints, this seems like a solid proposal.\n\nSo the first step is to make a proposal with this set. Then, in the ARGUMENT, I can explain that I selected items with high importance per effort, and the total effort is under the limit. The STRATEGIC REASONING would explain this approach.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I must include the STRATEGIC REASONING at the beginning of each message, then the ARGUMENT, and then the structured format. So in the first message, I need to write the STRATEGIC REASONING, then the ARGUMENT, then the PROPOSAL.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance per unit effort to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By selecting items like A71 (high importance, low effort) and others with favorable ratios, I aim to include as many high-value items as possible. The total effort of the proposed set is 9300, leaving 22 units of effort unused, which is within the limit.\n\nARGUMENT: The proposed set includes items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios, ensuring maximum personal value. The total effort is 9300, which is under the limit of 9322, allowing for potential adjustments if needed.\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A71', 'C17', 'B43', 'B96', 'B69', 'A65', 'A08', 'A25', 'C53', 'C84', 'A94', 'A46', 'A96', 'B23', 'B19', 'C72', 'C83', 'C82', 'B16', 'C79', 'C10'}\n\nBut I need to check if all these items are correctly listed. Also, the set should be a Python set, so the order doesn't matter. Also, need to make sure that the total effort is correct.\n\nYes, as calculated, it's 9300. So this is a valid proposal.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to include more items. For example, if I remove some items with lower importance but higher effort, and add others. But given the effort left is 22, it's not possible. So this seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, this is the first proposal. The next step would be to wait for the other participant's response. But since this is the first message, I need to send this proposal.\n"
