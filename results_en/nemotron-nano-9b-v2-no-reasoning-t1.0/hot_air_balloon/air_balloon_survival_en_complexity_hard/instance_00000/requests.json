            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 10073. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make assumptions or use strategies that work regardless of their preferences.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's list them out:\n\nA08:132, B95:800, A39:708, A65:302, B81:983, B34:420, A28:623, C82:349, B69:239, A87:28, B64:986, B15:660, C79:718, B16:707, C53:188, C83:774, C10:785, A97:775, A25:517, C84:768, A71:588, B23:657, B96:375, C51:310, C17:301, B19:388, C72:431, A94:950, A46:540, B43:997, B37:473, A88:831, A96:888, C60:879, A75:76.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let's start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd 132 → 132\n\n+800 → 932\n\n+708 → 1640\n\n+302 → 1942\n\n+983 → 2925\n\n+420 → 3345\n\n+623 → 3968\n\n+349 → 4317\n\n+239 → 4556\n\n+28 → 4584\n\n+986 → 5570\n\n+660 → 6230\n\n+718 → 6948\n\n+707 → 7655\n\n+188 → 7843\n\n+774 → 8617\n\n+785 → 9402\n\n+775 → 10177. Oh wait, that's already over 10073. So the total effort of all items is 10177, which exceeds the limit. So we can't take everything. Need to select a subset.\n\nSo the challenge is to pick items that maximize my importance without exceeding 10073 effort. Since I don't know the other's importance, I need to focus on items that are high in my importance but not too high in effort. Maybe a greedy approach where I prioritize items with the highest importance per unit effort.\n\nLet me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. That way, I can sort them and pick the most efficient ones first.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nA08: 231/132 ≈ 1.75\n\nB95: 899/800 ≈ 1.12375\n\nA39: 807/708 ≈ 1.1398\n\nA65: 401/302 ≈ 1.3278\n\nB81: 1082/983 ≈ 1.1007\n\nB34: 519/420 ≈ 1.2357\n\nA28: 722/623 ≈ 1.1589\n\nC82: 448/349 ≈ 1.2837\n\nB69: 338/239 ≈ 1.4142\n\nA87: 127/28 ≈ 4.5357 (very high ratio)\n\nB64: 1085/986 ≈ 1.1004\n\nB15: 759/660 ≈ 1.15\n\nC79: 817/718 ≈ 1.138\n\nB16: 806/707 ≈ 1.1399\n\nC53: 287/188 ≈ 1.5266\n\nC83: 873/774 ≈ 1.128\n\nC10: 884/785 ≈ 1.126\n\nA97: 874/775 ≈ 1.1277\n\nA25: 616/517 ≈ 1.1915\n\nC84: 867/768 ≈ 1.129\n\nA71: 687/588 ≈ 1.1684\n\nB23: 756/657 ≈ 1.1507\n\nB96: 474/375 ≈ 1.264\n\nC51: 409/310 ≈ 1.3194\n\nC17: 400/301 ≈ 1.3289\n\nB19: 487/388 ≈ 1.2552\n\nC72: 530/431 ≈ 1.2297\n\nA94: 1049/950 ≈ 1.1042\n\nA46: 639/540 ≈ 1.1833\n\nB43: 1096/997 ≈ 1.1003\n\nB37: 572/473 ≈ 1.2093\n\nA88: 930/831 ≈ 1.12\n\nA96: 987/888 ≈ 1.1115\n\nC60: 978/879 ≈ 1.1126\n\nA75: 175/76 ≈ 2.299 (very high ratio)\n\nSo the highest ratios are A87 (4.5357), A75 (2.299), C53 (1.5266), C17 (1.3289), B69 (1.4142), C51 (1.3194), B96 (1.264), etc.\n\nSo the strategy would be to take items with the highest importance per effort first. Let's start adding them in order of ratio until we reach the limit.\n\nStart with A87 (effort 28, importance 127). Total effort so far: 28. Importance: 127.\n\nNext, A75 (76 effort, 175). Total effort: 28+76=104. Importance: 127+175=302.\n\nNext, C53 (188 effort, 287). Total effort: 104+188=292. Importance: 302+287=589.\n\nNext, C17 (301 effort, 400). Total effort: 292+301=593. Importance: 589+400=989.\n\nNext, B69 (239 effort, 338). Total effort: 593+239=832. Importance: 989+338=1327.\n\nNext, C51 (310 effort, 409). Total effort: 832+310=1142. Importance: 1327+409=1736.\n\nNext, B96 (375 effort, 474). Total effort: 1142+375=1517. Importance: 1736+474=2210.\n\nNext, C82 (349 effort, 448). Total effort: 1517+349=1866. Importance: 2210+448=2658.\n\nNext, A25 (517 effort, 616). Total effort: 1866+517=2383. Importance: 2658+616=3274.\n\nNext, B16 (707 effort, 806). Total effort: 2383+707=3090. Importance: 3274+806=4080.\n\nNext, C84 (768 effort, 867). Total effort: 3090+768=3858. Importance: 4080+867=4947.\n\nNext, A65 (302 effort, 401). Total effort: 3858+302=4160. Importance: 4947+401=5348.\n\nNext, B34 (420 effort, 519). Total effort: 4160+420=4580. Importance: 5348+519=5867.\n\nNext, A39 (708 effort, 807). Total effort: 4580+708=5288. Importance: 5867+807=6674.\n\nNext, B23 (657 effort, 756). Total effort: 5288+657=5945. Importance: 6674+756=7430.\n\nNext, A94 (950 effort, 1049). Total effort: 5945+950=6895. Importance: 7430+1049=8479.\n\nNext, A46 (540 effort, 639). Total effort: 6895+540=7435. Importance: 8479+639=9118.\n\nNext, B43 (997 effort, 1096). Total effort: 7435+997=8432. Importance: 9118+1096=10214.\n\nNext, A96 (888 effort, 987). Total effort: 8432+888=9320. Importance: 10214+987=11201.\n\nNext, C60 (879 effort, 978). Total effort: 9320+879=10199. Oh, that's over the limit. So can't take C60. So stop here.\n\nWait, but 9320 is under 10073. Wait, 9320 + 879 is 10199, which is over. So we can't take C60. So the next item after A96 would be C60, but adding it would exceed. So the current total is 9320, which is under 10073. So maybe there's room for more items. Let's check the remaining items.\n\nWhat's left? Let's see which items haven't been added yet. The ones not in the list above. Let's check:\n\nOriginal list: A08, B95, A39, A65, B81, B34, A28, C82, B69, A87, B64, B15, C79, B16, C53, C83, C10, A97, A25, C84, A71, B23, B96, C51, C17, B19, C72, A94, A46, B43, B37, A88, A96, C60, A75.\n\nWait, in the list above, I added A87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96. So remaining items are:\n\nA08, B95, B81, B34 (wait, B34 was added?), A28, C83, C10, A97, B64, B15, C79, B19, C72, B37, A88.\n\nWait, let me check again. The items added so far are:\n\nA87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96.\n\nSo remaining items are:\n\nA08, B95, B81, A28, C83, C10, A97, B64, B15, C79, B19, C72, B37, A88.\n\nNow, the current total effort is 9320. The limit is 10073. So remaining effort is 10073 - 9320 = 753.\n\nSo we can add items with effort up to 753. Let's look at the remaining items and their effort:\n\nA08:132, B95:800 (too big), B81:983 (too big), A28:623, C83:774 (too big), C10:785 (too big), A97:775 (too big), B64:986 (too big), B15:660 (too big), C79:718 (too big), B19:388, C72:431, B37:473, A88:831 (too big).\n\nSo possible items to add are A08 (132), A28 (623), B19 (388), C72 (431), B37 (473). Let's check their ratios again.\n\nA08: 231/132 ≈1.75\n\nA28:722/623≈1.1589\n\nB19:487/388≈1.255\n\nC72:530/431≈1.2297\n\nB37:572/473≈1.2093\n\nSo the highest ratio here is A08. Let's add A08. Effort: 132. Total effort becomes 9320+132=9452. Importance: 11201+231=11432.\n\nNow remaining effort: 10073-9452=621.\n\nNext, check remaining items. B19 (388), C72 (431), B37 (473). A28 (623) is over 621. So possible items: B19 (388), C72 (431), B37 (473). Let's check their ratios.\n\nB19:1.255, C72:1.2297, B37:1.2093. So B19 is next. Add B19. Effort: 388. Total effort: 9452+388=9840. Importance: 11432+487=11919.\n\nRemaining effort: 10073-9840=233.\n\nNow, remaining items: C72 (431), B37 (473). Both are over 233. So can't add. So the current set is up to A96 and A08, B19. Total effort 9840, importance 11919.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. Let me check if adding other items in a different order could yield higher importance. For example, maybe instead of adding A08, maybe add B19 first. But since A08 has a higher ratio, it's better to take it first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check if there are other items with lower effort that I missed. For example, C53 was already added. What about C51? Already added. C17 added. So the remaining items are as above.\n\nSo the current set is A87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96, A08, B19. Total effort 9840, importance 11919.\n\nIs there any other item that can be added with the remaining 233 effort? Let's check:\n\nA08 is already added. B19 added. What about C53? Already added. C51 added. C17 added. B69 added. B96 added. C82 added. A25 added. B16 added. C84 added. A65 added. B34 added. A39 added. B23 added. A94 added. A46 added. B43 added. A96 added. So the remaining items are B95, B81, B64, C83, C10, A97, B64, etc. All of which have effort over 233. So no.\n\nSo this seems like a good set. But maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe instead of taking A96 (888 effort), which is a high effort item, but maybe replacing it with other items. But since A96 has a high importance (987) and the ratio is 1.1115, which is lower than some others. But in the current approach, we took it because it's part of the high ratio list. However, maybe there's a way to swap some items to get more importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct. But since I can't know the other's importance, I need to maximize my own. So this set seems good. However, the total effort is 9840, which is under 10073. So there's 233 left. Maybe there's another item that can be added. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the remaining items after adding A08 and B19 are:\n\nC72 (431), B37 (473). Both are over 233. So no. What about C53? Already added. C51 added. C17 added. B69 added. B96 added. C82 added. A25 added. B16 added. C84 added. A65 added. B34 added. A39 added. B23 added. A94 added. A46 added. B43 added. A96 added. A08 added. B19 added. So no other items can be added. So the total is 9840, which is under the limit. So maybe there's a way to add more items. Wait, maybe I missed some items. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the original list has 34 items. Let me count how many I've added. Let's see:\n\nA87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96, A08, B19. That's 21 items. So 34-21=13 items left. But their efforts are too high. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I don't take A96 (888 effort), but take other items. Let's see. Suppose I remove A96 (888) and add other items. The effort saved would be 888, allowing adding items with total effort up to 888. But that might not be better. For example, if I remove A96 (987 importance) and add items with total effort 888. But the importance of those items would need to be higher than 987. But looking at the remaining items, their importance is lower. For example, B95 has 899 importance but effort 800. If I remove A96 (888 effort, 987 importance) and add B95 (800 effort, 899 importance), the net gain is 899-987 = -88, which is worse. So that's not good. Similarly, other items may not compensate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to select items. But given the time constraints, the initial approach seems solid. So the proposed set would be the items I listed. However, I need to make sure that the total effort is under 10073. Let me recalculate the total effort:\n\nA87:28\n\nA75:76 → 104\n\nC53:188 → 292\n\nC17:301 → 593\n\nB69:239 → 832\n\nC51:310 → 1142\n\nB96:375 → 1517\n\nC82:349 → 1866\n\nA25:517 → 2383\n\nB16:707 → 3090\n\nC84:768 → 3858\n\nA65:302 → 4160\n\nB34:420 → 4580\n\nA39:708 → 5288\n\nB23:657 → 5945\n\nA94:950 → 6895\n\nA46:540 → 7435\n\nB43:997 → 8432\n\nA96:888 → 9320\n\nA08:132 → 9452\n\nB19:388 → 9840\n\nYes, that's correct. 9840 is under 10073. So the total effort is acceptable. The importance is 11919. That's a good total. But maybe there's a way to get more. Let me check if there are other items that can be added. For example, C72 (431) is 431 effort. If I have 233 left, can't add. What about C53? Already added. C51 added. C17 added. B69 added. B96 added. C82 added. A25 added. B16 added. C84 added. A65 added. B34 added. A39 added. B23 added. A94 added. A46 added. B43 added. A96 added. A08 added. B19 added. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different order. For example, after adding A87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, maybe instead of adding A96, add other items. But A96 has a high importance. So it's better to take it. So the current set is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the proposal would be the set of items I've selected. But I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format. However, the user hasn't provided the other participant's proposal yet. Since this is the first message, I need to start with a STRATEGIC REASONING and then a PROPOSAL.\n\nWait, the interaction protocol says that the first message should include STRATEGIC REASONING. So the first message should have STRATEGIC REASONING, then maybe a PROPOSAL or ARGUMENT. But according to the rules, the first message must include STRATEGIC REASONING. So I need to start with that.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items with the highest importance per effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. I'll start by selecting items with the highest ratios, such as A87 and A75, then proceed to add other high-ratio items until the effort limit is reached. This approach ensures that I get the most value for the effort spent.\n\nThen, a PROPOSAL. But which set? The one I calculated. Let me list all the items in the set:\n\nA87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96, A08, B19.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total effort is under 10073. As calculated, it's 9840. So that's acceptable. So the PROPOSAL would be this set.\n\nBut maybe the user expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that's more balanced, but given the information, the greedy approach is the best I can do.\n\nSo the first message would be the STRATEGIC REASONING and then a PROPOSAL. Then, the other participant would respond with their proposal or refusal. But since this is the first message, I need to start with that.\n",

                "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 10073. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make assumptions or use strategies that work regardless of their preferences.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's list them out:\n\nA08:132, B95:800, A39:708, A65:302, B81:983, B34:420, A28:623, C82:349, B69:239, A87:28, B64:986, B15:660, C79:718, B16:707, C53:188, C83:774, C10:785, A97:775, A25:517, C84:768, A71:588, B23:657, B96:375, C51:310, C17:301, B19:388, C72:431, A94:950, A46:540, B43:997, B37:473, A88:831, A96:888, C60:879, A75:76.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let's start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd 132 → 132\n\n+800 → 932\n\n+708 → 1640\n\n+302 → 1942\n\n+983 → 2925\n\n+420 → 3345\n\n+623 → 3968\n\n+349 → 4317\n\n+239 → 4556\n\n+28 → 4584\n\n+986 → 5570\n\n+660 → 6230\n\n+718 → 6948\n\n+707 → 7655\n\n+188 → 7843\n\n+774 → 8617\n\n+785 → 9402\n\n+775 → 10177. Oh wait, that's already over 10073. So the total effort of all items is 10177, which exceeds the limit. So we can't take everything. Need to select a subset.\n\nSo the challenge is to pick items that maximize my importance without exceeding 10073 effort. Since I don't know the other's importance, I need to focus on items that are high in my importance but not too high in effort. Maybe a greedy approach where I prioritize items with the highest importance per unit effort.\n\nLet me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. That way, I can sort them and pick the most efficient ones first.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nA08: 231/132 ≈ 1.75\n\nB95: 899/800 ≈ 1.12375\n\nA39: 807/708 ≈ 1.1398\n\nA65: 401/302 ≈ 1.3278\n\nB81: 1082/983 ≈ 1.1007\n\nB34: 519/420 ≈ 1.2357\n\nA28: 722/623 ≈ 1.1589\n\nC82: 448/349 ≈ 1.2837\n\nB69: 338/239 ≈ 1.4142\n\nA87: 127/28 ≈ 4.5357 (very high ratio)\n\nB64: 1085/986 ≈ 1.1004\n\nB15: 759/660 ≈ 1.15\n\nC79: 817/718 ≈ 1.138\n\nB16: 806/707 ≈ 1.1399\n\nC53: 287/188 ≈ 1.5266\n\nC83: 873/774 ≈ 1.128\n\nC10: 884/785 ≈ 1.126\n\nA97: 874/775 ≈ 1.1277\n\nA25: 616/517 ≈ 1.1915\n\nC84: 867/768 ≈ 1.129\n\nA71: 687/588 ≈ 1.1684\n\nB23: 756/657 ≈ 1.1507\n\nB96: 474/375 ≈ 1.264\n\nC51: 409/310 ≈ 1.3194\n\nC17: 400/301 ≈ 1.3289\n\nB19: 487/388 ≈ 1.2552\n\nC72: 530/431 ≈ 1.2297\n\nA94: 1049/950 ≈ 1.1042\n\nA46: 639/540 ≈ 1.1833\n\nB43: 1096/997 ≈ 1.1003\n\nB37: 572/473 ≈ 1.2093\n\nA88: 930/831 ≈ 1.12\n\nA96: 987/888 ≈ 1.1115\n\nC60: 978/879 ≈ 1.1126\n\nA75: 175/76 ≈ 2.299 (very high ratio)\n\nSo the highest ratios are A87 (4.5357), A75 (2.299), C53 (1.5266), C17 (1.3289), B69 (1.4142), C51 (1.3194), B96 (1.264), etc.\n\nSo the strategy would be to take items with the highest importance per effort first. Let's start adding them in order of ratio until we reach the limit.\n\nStart with A87 (effort 28, importance 127). Total effort so far: 28. Importance: 127.\n\nNext, A75 (76 effort, 175). Total effort: 28+76=104. Importance: 127+175=302.\n\nNext, C53 (188 effort, 287). Total effort: 104+188=292. Importance: 302+287=589.\n\nNext, C17 (301 effort, 400). Total effort: 292+301=593. Importance: 589+400=989.\n\nNext, B69 (239 effort, 338). Total effort: 593+239=832. Importance: 989+338=1327.\n\nNext, C51 (310 effort, 409). Total effort: 832+310=1142. Importance: 1327+409=1736.\n\nNext, B96 (375 effort, 474). Total effort: 1142+375=1517. Importance: 1736+474=2210.\n\nNext, C82 (349 effort, 448). Total effort: 1517+349=1866. Importance: 2210+448=2658.\n\nNext, A25 (517 effort, 616). Total effort: 1866+517=2383. Importance: 2658+616=3274.\n\nNext, B16 (707 effort, 806). Total effort: 2383+707=3090. Importance: 3274+806=4080.\n\nNext, C84 (768 effort, 867). Total effort: 3090+768=3858. Importance: 4080+867=4947.\n\nNext, A65 (302 effort, 401). Total effort: 3858+302=4160. Importance: 4947+401=5348.\n\nNext, B34 (420 effort, 519). Total effort: 4160+420=4580. Importance: 5348+519=5867.\n\nNext, A39 (708 effort, 807). Total effort: 4580+708=5288. Importance: 5867+807=6674.\n\nNext, B23 (657 effort, 756). Total effort: 5288+657=5945. Importance: 6674+756=7430.\n\nNext, A94 (950 effort, 1049). Total effort: 5945+950=6895. Importance: 7430+1049=8479.\n\nNext, A46 (540 effort, 639). Total effort: 6895+540=7435. Importance: 8479+639=9118.\n\nNext, B43 (997 effort, 1096). Total effort: 7435+997=8432. Importance: 9118+1096=10214.\n\nNext, A96 (888 effort, 987). Total effort: 8432+888=9320. Importance: 10214+987=11201.\n\nNext, C60 (879 effort, 978). Total effort: 9320+879=10199. Oh, that's over the limit. So can't take C60. So stop here.\n\nWait, but 9320 is under 10073. Wait, 9320 + 879 is 10199, which is over. So we can't take C60. So the next item after A96 would be C60, but adding it would exceed. So the current total is 9320, which is under 10073. So maybe there's room for more items. Let's check the remaining items.\n\nWhat's left? Let's see which items haven't been added yet. The ones not in the list above. Let's check:\n\nOriginal list: A08, B95, A39, A65, B81, B34, A28, C82, B69, A87, B64, B15, C79, B16, C53, C83, C10, A97, A25, C84, A71, B23, B96, C51, C17, B19, C72, A94, A46, B43, B37, A88, A96, C60, A75.\n\nWait, in the list above, I added A87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96. So remaining items are:\n\nA08, B95, B81, B34 (wait, B34 was added?), A28, C83, C10, A97, B64, B15, C79, B19, C72, B37, A88.\n\nWait, let me check again. The items added so far are:\n\nA87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96.\n\nSo remaining items are:\n\nA08, B95, B81, A28, C83, C10, A97, B64, B15, C79, B19, C72, B37, A88.\n\nNow, the current total effort is 9320. The limit is 10073. So remaining effort is 10073 - 9320 = 753.\n\nSo we can add items with effort up to 753. Let's look at the remaining items and their effort:\n\nA08:132, B95:800 (too big), B81:983 (too big), A28:623, C83:774 (too big), C10:785 (too big), A97:775 (too big), B64:986 (too big), B15:660 (too big), C79:718 (too big), B19:388, C72:431, B37:473, A88:831 (too big).\n\nSo possible items to add are A08 (132), A28 (623), B19 (388), C72 (431), B37 (473). Let's check their ratios again.\n\nA08: 231/132 ≈1.75\n\nA28:722/623≈1.1589\n\nB19:487/388≈1.255\n\nC72:530/431≈1.2297\n\nB37:572/473≈1.2093\n\nSo the highest ratio here is A08. Let's add A08. Effort: 132. Total effort becomes 9320+132=9452. Importance: 11201+231=11432.\n\nNow remaining effort: 10073-9452=621.\n\nNext, check remaining items. B19 (388), C72 (431), B37 (473). A28 (623) is over 621. So possible items: B19 (388), C72 (431), B37 (473). Let's check their ratios.\n\nB19:1.255, C72:1.2297, B37:1.2093. So B19 is next. Add B19. Effort: 388. Total effort: 9452+388=9840. Importance: 11432+487=11919.\n\nRemaining effort: 10073-9840=233.\n\nNow, remaining items: C72 (431), B37 (473). Both are over 233. So can't add. So the current set is up to A96 and A08, B19. Total effort 9840, importance 11919.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better combination. Let me check if adding other items in a different order could yield higher importance. For example, maybe instead of adding A08, maybe add B19 first. But since A08 has a higher ratio, it's better to take it first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check if there are other items with lower effort that I missed. For example, C53 was already added. What about C51? Already added. C17 added. So the remaining items are as above.\n\nSo the current set is A87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96, A08, B19. Total effort 9840, importance 11919.\n\nIs there any other item that can be added with the remaining 233 effort? Let's check:\n\nA08 is already added. B19 added. What about C53? Already added. C51 added. C17 added. B69 added. B96 added. C82 added. A25 added. B16 added. C84 added. A65 added. B34 added. A39 added. B23 added. A94 added. A46 added. B43 added. A96 added. So the remaining items are B95, B81, B64, C83, C10, A97, B64, etc. All of which have effort over 233. So no.\n\nSo this seems like a good set. But maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe instead of taking A96 (888 effort), which is a high effort item, but maybe replacing it with other items. But since A96 has a high importance (987) and the ratio is 1.1115, which is lower than some others. But in the current approach, we took it because it's part of the high ratio list. However, maybe there's a way to swap some items to get more importance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct. But since I can't know the other's importance, I need to maximize my own. So this set seems good. However, the total effort is 9840, which is under 10073. So there's 233 left. Maybe there's another item that can be added. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the remaining items after adding A08 and B19 are:\n\nC72 (431), B37 (473). Both are over 233. So no. What about C53? Already added. C51 added. C17 added. B69 added. B96 added. C82 added. A25 added. B16 added. C84 added. A65 added. B34 added. A39 added. B23 added. A94 added. A46 added. B43 added. A96 added. A08 added. B19 added. So no other items can be added. So the total is 9840, which is under the limit. So maybe there's a way to add more items. Wait, maybe I missed some items. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the original list has 34 items. Let me count how many I've added. Let's see:\n\nA87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96, A08, B19. That's 21 items. So 34-21=13 items left. But their efforts are too high. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I don't take A96 (888 effort), but take other items. Let's see. Suppose I remove A96 (888) and add other items. The effort saved would be 888, allowing adding items with total effort up to 888. But that might not be better. For example, if I remove A96 (987 importance) and add items with total effort 888. But the importance of those items would need to be higher than 987. But looking at the remaining items, their importance is lower. For example, B95 has 899 importance but effort 800. If I remove A96 (888 effort, 987 importance) and add B95 (800 effort, 899 importance), the net gain is 899-987 = -88, which is worse. So that's not good. Similarly, other items may not compensate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to select items. But given the time constraints, the initial approach seems solid. So the proposed set would be the items I listed. However, I need to make sure that the total effort is under 10073. Let me recalculate the total effort:\n\nA87:28\n\nA75:76 → 104\n\nC53:188 → 292\n\nC17:301 → 593\n\nB69:239 → 832\n\nC51:310 → 1142\n\nB96:375 → 1517\n\nC82:349 → 1866\n\nA25:517 → 2383\n\nB16:707 → 3090\n\nC84:768 → 3858\n\nA65:302 → 4160\n\nB34:420 → 4580\n\nA39:708 → 5288\n\nB23:657 → 5945\n\nA94:950 → 6895\n\nA46:540 → 7435\n\nB43:997 → 8432\n\nA96:888 → 9320\n\nA08:132 → 9452\n\nB19:388 → 9840\n\nYes, that's correct. 9840 is under 10073. So the total effort is acceptable. The importance is 11919. That's a good total. But maybe there's a way to get more. Let me check if there are other items that can be added. For example, C72 (431) is 431 effort. If I have 233 left, can't add. What about C53? Already added. C51 added. C17 added. B69 added. B96 added. C82 added. A25 added. B16 added. C84 added. A65 added. B34 added. A39 added. B23 added. A94 added. A46 added. B43 added. A96 added. A08 added. B19 added. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different order. For example, after adding A87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, maybe instead of adding A96, add other items. But A96 has a high importance. So it's better to take it. So the current set is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the proposal would be the set of items I've selected. But I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format. However, the user hasn't provided the other participant's proposal yet. Since this is the first message, I need to start with a STRATEGIC REASONING and then a PROPOSAL.\n\nWait, the interaction protocol says that the first message should include STRATEGIC REASONING. So the first message should have STRATEGIC REASONING, then maybe a PROPOSAL or ARGUMENT. But according to the rules, the first message must include STRATEGIC REASONING. So I need to start with that.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items with the highest importance per effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. I'll start by selecting items with the highest ratios, such as A87 and A75, then proceed to add other high-ratio items until the effort limit is reached. This approach ensures that I get the most value for the effort spent.\n\nThen, a PROPOSAL. But which set? The one I calculated. Let me list all the items in the set:\n\nA87, A75, C53, C17, B69, C51, B96, C82, A25, B16, C84, A65, B34, A39, B23, A94, A46, B43, A96, A08, B19.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total effort is under 10073. As calculated, it's 9840. So that's acceptable. So the PROPOSAL would be this set.\n\nBut maybe the user expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that's more balanced, but given the information, the greedy approach is the best I can do.\n\nSo the first message would be the STRATEGIC REASONING and then a PROPOSAL. Then, the other participant would respond with their proposal or refusal. But since this is the first message, I need to start with that.\n",

Let me check the exact structure required.\n\nThe user specified that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}, followed by other tags. In my last response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING first, then PROPOSAL, then ARGUMENT. That should be correct. Wait, maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING wasn't the very first line? Let me look at the exact message.\n\nIn the previous response, the first line was \"STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize...\" which seems correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe there's a formatting issue, like missing a colon or space. Let me check the exact syntax. The user said the structured format must be TAG: {...} with colon and whitespace. So \"STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}\" is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the first message, but no, the protocol allows other tags after. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.\" So each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then other tags. \n\nIn my last response, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING. Maybe the problem is that the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first thing in the message, without any other text before it. Let me check the exact message structure. The user's example shows that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}, then other tags. So my previous response should be correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first line, with no other text before it. In my previous response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING as the first line, so that should be okay. Maybe there's a typo or a missing space. Let me check the exact string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be in a specific format, like using curly braces with the arguments. But in my response, I used a string inside the curly braces. The user's example shows that the STRATEGIC REASONING can have any text, as it's a hidden message. \n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that in the previous response, after the STRATEGIC REASONING, the PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT were included, but the user is expecting only the STRATEGIC REASONING in the first message. Wait, no, the protocol allows multiple tags in a message. The user's instruction says that each message can have multiple structured formats, but the STRATEGIC REASONING must be first. \n\nWait, looking back at the user's error message: \"Your response did not start with the proper strategic reasoning tag at the very beginning of your response.\" So the first thing in the response must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my last response, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING, so that should be correct. \n\nMaybe the problem is that the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the first message, but that's not the case. The protocol allows other tags after. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be in a specific format, like using a set or something else. But the user's example shows that it's a string. \n\nI think the issue might be that in the previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING was not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax. The user said: \"The contents will not be given to the other participant so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.\"\n\nSo the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, and the content can be anything. The key is that it must be the first structured format. \n\nIn my previous response, I had:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize... \n\nPROPOSAL: {...}\n\nARGUMENT: ...\n\nThat should be correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING wasn't the first thing in the message. Let me check the exact message again. \n\nYes, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING: ... So that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be in a specific format, like using a set or something else. But the user's example shows that it's a string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the message, but that's not the case. The protocol allows other tags. \n\nI'm a bit confused. The user's error message says that the response didn't start with the proper strategic reasoning tag. But in my last response, it did. Maybe there's a formatting issue in the way the message was sent. For example, if there was a line break or something before the STRATEGIC REASONING. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be in a specific format, like using a set. But the user's example shows that it's a string. \n\nI think I need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the very first line of the message, with no other text before it. Let me try to structure the response again, ensuring that the first line is exactly \"STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}\" with no leading spaces or other content. \n\nSo, the correct format would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: { ... }\n\nThen other tags. \n\nIn my previous response, I had that. So maybe the user's system is not parsing it correctly. To be safe, I'll make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, with no other text before it. Let me try that again.\n",
