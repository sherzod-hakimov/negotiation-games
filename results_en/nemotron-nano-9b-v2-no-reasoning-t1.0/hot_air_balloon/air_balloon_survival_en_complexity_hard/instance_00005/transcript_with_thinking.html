        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 7351<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;A08&quot;: 518, &quot;B95&quot;: 656, &quot;A39&quot;: 96, &quot;A65&quot;: 780, &quot;B81&quot;: 190, &quot;B34&quot;: 224, &quot;A28&quot;: 231, &quot;C82&quot;: 181, &quot;B69&quot;: 312, &quot;A87&quot;: 928, &quot;B64&quot;: 826, &quot;B15&quot;: 101, &quot;C79&quot;: 61, &quot;B16&quot;: 814, &quot;C53&quot;: 322, &quot;C83&quot;: 900, &quot;C10&quot;: 744, &quot;A97&quot;: 150, &quot;A25&quot;: 65, &quot;C84&quot;: 853, &quot;A71&quot;: 454, &quot;B23&quot;: 154, &quot;B96&quot;: 237, &quot;C51&quot;: 45, &quot;C17&quot;: 766, &quot;B19&quot;: 294, &quot;C72&quot;: 985, &quot;A94&quot;: 353, &quot;A46&quot;: 60, &quot;B43&quot;: 604, &quot;B37&quot;: 92, &quot;A88&quot;: 454, &quot;A96&quot;: 206, &quot;C60&quot;: 813, &quot;A75&quot;: 234}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;A08&quot;: 616, &quot;B95&quot;: 754, &quot;A39&quot;: 194, &quot;A65&quot;: 878, &quot;B81&quot;: 288, &quot;B34&quot;: 322, &quot;A28&quot;: 329, &quot;C82&quot;: 279, &quot;B69&quot;: 410, &quot;A87&quot;: 1026, &quot;B64&quot;: 924, &quot;B15&quot;: 199, &quot;C79&quot;: 159, &quot;B16&quot;: 912, &quot;C53&quot;: 420, &quot;C83&quot;: 998, &quot;C10&quot;: 842, &quot;A97&quot;: 248, &quot;A25&quot;: 163, &quot;C84&quot;: 951, &quot;A71&quot;: 552, &quot;B23&quot;: 252, &quot;B96&quot;: 335, &quot;C51&quot;: 143, &quot;C17&quot;: 864, &quot;B19&quot;: 392, &quot;C72&quot;: 1083, &quot;A94&quot;: 451, &quot;A46&quot;: 158, &quot;B43&quot;: 702, &quot;B37&quot;: 190, &quot;A88&quot;: 552, &quot;A96&quot;: 304, &quot;C60&quot;: 911, &quot;A75&quot;: 332}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>You may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>You may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>Total effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.<br/>Do NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.<br/>A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7351. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>A08:518, B95:656, A39:96, A65:780, B81:190, B34:224, A28:231, C82:181, B69:312, A87:928, B64:826, B15:101, C79:61, B16:814, C53:322, C83:900, C10:744, A97:150, A25:65, C84:853, A71:454, B23:154, B96:237, C51:45, C17:766, B19:294, C72:985, A94:353, A46:60, B43:604, B37:92, A88:454, A96:206, C60:813, A75:234.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step. Let me start adding:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add 518 (A08) → 518<br/><br/>+656 (B95) → 1174<br/><br/>+96 (A39) → 1270<br/><br/>+780 (A65) → 2050<br/><br/>+190 (B81) → 2240<br/><br/>+224 (B34) → 2464<br/><br/>+231 (A28) → 2695<br/><br/>+181 (C82) → 2876<br/><br/>+312 (B69) → 3188<br/><br/>+928 (A87) → 4116<br/><br/>+826 (B64) → 4942<br/><br/>+101 (B15) → 5043<br/><br/>+61 (C79) → 5104<br/><br/>+814 (B16) → 5918<br/><br/>+322 (C53) → 6240<br/><br/>+900 (C83) → 7140<br/><br/>+744 (C10) → 7884 → Oh, this is already over 7351. So even before adding the rest, we&#x27;re over. So the total effort of all items is way over the limit. Therefore, we can&#x27;t take all items. So we need to select a subset.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe a greedy approach where I sort items by importance/effort ratio and pick the highest ones first until the effort is under the limit.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. Then sort them in descending order and pick until the sum of effort is &lt;=7351.<br/><br/>Let me list all items with their importance and effort:<br/><br/>Item | Importance | Effort | Ratio (Importance/Effort)<br/>A08 | 616 | 518 | ~1.189<br/>B95 | 754 | 656 | ~1.149<br/>A39 | 194 | 96 | ~2.021<br/>A65 | 878 | 780 | ~1.126<br/>B81 | 288 | 190 | ~1.516<br/>B34 | 322 | 224 | ~1.438<br/>A28 | 329 | 231 | ~1.424<br/>C82 | 279 | 181 | ~1.541<br/>B69 | 410 | 312 | ~1.314<br/>A87 | 1026 | 928 | ~1.106<br/>B64 | 924 | 826 | ~1.119<br/>B15 | 199 | 101 | ~1.970<br/>C79 | 159 | 61 | ~2.607<br/>B16 | 912 | 814 | ~1.120<br/>C53 | 420 | 322 | ~1.304<br/>C83 | 998 | 900 | ~1.109<br/>C10 | 842 | 744 | ~1.132<br/>A97 | 248 | 150 | ~1.653<br/>A25 | 163 | 65 | ~2.508<br/>C84 | 951 | 853 | ~1.115<br/>A71 | 552 | 454 | ~1.216<br/>B23 | 252 | 154 | ~1.636<br/>B96 | 335 | 237 | ~1.414<br/>C51 | 143 | 45 | ~3.178<br/>C17 | 864 | 766 | ~1.128<br/>B19 | 392 | 294 | ~1.333<br/>C72 | 1083 | 985 | ~1.100<br/>A94 | 451 | 353 | ~1.278<br/>A46 | 158 | 60 | ~2.633<br/>B43 | 702 | 604 | ~1.162<br/>B37 | 190 | 92 | ~2.065<br/>A88 | 552 | 454 | ~1.216<br/>A96 | 304 | 206 | ~1.476<br/>C60 | 911 | 813 | ~1.120<br/><br/>Now, sorting these by ratio descending:<br/><br/>C51 (3.178), A25 (2.508), C79 (2.607), A46 (2.633), A39 (2.021), B15 (1.970), B37 (2.065), A08 (1.189), B95 (1.149), A65 (1.126), B64 (1.119), C83 (1.109), C10 (1.132), B16 (1.120), C60 (1.120), A71 (1.216), B23 (1.636), B96 (1.414), A94 (1.278), C82 (1.541), B81 (1.516), A28 (1.424), B34 (1.438), C53 (1.304), B69 (1.314), C17 (1.128), A87 (1.106), C84 (1.115), A96 (1.476), B43 (1.162), A88 (1.216), C72 (1.100), B19 (1.333), A97 (1.653)<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should re-sort them properly. Let me list all ratios:<br/><br/>C51: 3.178 (highest)<br/>A25: 2.508<br/>C79: 2.607<br/>A46: 2.633<br/>A39: 2.021<br/>B15: 1.970<br/>B37: 2.065<br/>A08: 1.189<br/>B95: 1.149<br/>A65: 1.126<br/>B64: 1.119<br/>C83: 1.109<br/>C10: 1.132<br/>B16: 1.120<br/>C60: 1.120<br/>A71: 1.216<br/>B23: 1.636<br/>B96: 1.414<br/>A94: 1.278<br/>C82: 1.541<br/>B81: 1.516<br/>A28: 1.424<br/>B34: 1.438<br/>C53: 1.304<br/>B69: 1.314<br/>C17: 1.128<br/>A87: 1.106<br/>C84: 1.115<br/>A96: 1.476<br/>B43: 1.162<br/>A88: 1.216<br/>C72: 1.100<br/>B19: 1.333<br/>A97: 1.653<br/><br/>So the order from highest ratio to lowest would be:<br/><br/>1. C51 (3.178)<br/>2. A25 (2.508)<br/>3. C79 (2.607)<br/>4. A46 (2.633)<br/>5. A39 (2.021)<br/>6. B37 (2.065)<br/>7. B15 (1.970)<br/>8. A08 (1.189)<br/>9. B95 (1.149)<br/>10. A65 (1.126)<br/>11. B64 (1.119)<br/>12. C83 (1.109)<br/>13. C10 (1.132)<br/>14. B16 (1.120)<br/>15. C60 (1.120)<br/>16. A71 (1.216)<br/>17. B23 (1.636)<br/>18. B96 (1.414)<br/>19. A94 (1.278)<br/>20. C82 (1.541)<br/>21. B81 (1.516)<br/>22. A28 (1.424)<br/>23. B34 (1.438)<br/>24. C53 (1.304)<br/>25. B69 (1.314)<br/>26. C17 (1.128)<br/>27. A87 (1.106)<br/>28. C84 (1.115)<br/>29. A96 (1.476)<br/>30. B43 (1.162)<br/>31. A88 (1.216)<br/>32. C72 (1.100)<br/>33. B19 (1.333)<br/>34. A97 (1.653)<br/><br/>Wait, some of these ratios might be miscalculated. Let me double-check a few. For example, A46: 158/60 = 2.633, correct. C79: 159/61 ≈ 2.607. A25: 163/65 ≈ 2.507. C51: 143/45 ≈ 3.178. Yes.<br/><br/>So the highest ratio items are C51, A25, C79, A46, etc. So the strategy would be to take these high ratio items first until the effort is under the limit.<br/><br/>Let me start adding the effort of the top items:<br/><br/>Start with C51 (45 effort). Total effort: 45. Importance: 143.<br/><br/>Next A25 (65). Total: 45+65=110. Importance: 143+163=306.<br/><br/>Next C79 (61). Total: 110+61=171. Importance: 306+159=465.<br/><br/>Next A46 (60). Total: 171+60=231. Importance: 465+158=623.<br/><br/>Next A39 (96). Total: 231+96=327. Importance: 623+194=817.<br/><br/>Next B37 (92). Total: 327+92=419. Importance: 817+190=1007.<br/><br/>Next B15 (101). Total: 419+101=520. Importance: 1007+199=1206.<br/><br/>Next A08 (518). Total: 520+518=1038. Importance: 1206+616=1822.<br/><br/>Next B95 (656). Total: 1038+656=1694. Importance: 1822+754=2576.<br/><br/>Next A65 (780). Total: 1694+780=2474. Importance: 2576+878=3454.<br/><br/>Next B64 (826). Total: 2474+826=3300. Importance: 3454+924=4378.<br/><br/>Next C83 (900). Total: 3300+900=4200. Importance: 4378+998=5376.<br/><br/>Next C10 (744). Total: 4200+744=4944. Importance: 5376+842=6218.<br/><br/>Next B16 (814). Total: 4944+814=5758. Importance: 6218+912=7130.<br/><br/>Next C60 (813). Total: 5758+813=6571. Wait, 6571 is over 7351? No, 5758+813=6571. 6571 is under 7351. So add C60. Importance: 7130+911=8041.<br/><br/>Next A71 (454). Total: 6571+454=7025. Importance: 8041+552=8593.<br/><br/>Next B23 (154). Total: 7025+154=7179. Importance: 8593+252=8845.<br/><br/>Next B96 (237). Total: 7179+237=7416. Oh, that&#x27;s over 7351. So can&#x27;t add B96. So stop here. So up to B23, total effort is 7179, which is under 7351. Then maybe add some other items.<br/><br/>Wait, after B23, total is 7179. Remaining effort: 7351-7179=172. So can we add any items with effort &lt;=172?<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items. Let&#x27;s see which items are left. The ones not yet added are:<br/><br/>C82 (181), B81 (190), A28 (231), B34 (224), C53 (322), B69 (312), C84 (853), A96 (206), B43 (604), A88 (454), C72 (985), B19 (294), A97 (150).<br/><br/>Wait, A97 has effort 150. So 172-150=22. So adding A97 would bring total to 7179+150=7329, which is under 7351. Then importance would be 8845+248=9093.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe other items. Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>A97: 150. Yes, that&#x27;s possible. So adding A97 would be good. Then total effort 7329. Then remaining 22. Are there any items with effort &lt;=22? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the list, A25 is already taken. A46 is taken. A39 is taken. B15 is taken. B37 is taken. B19 is 294, which is over. C51 is taken. C79 is taken. A25 is taken. A46 is taken. A39 is taken. B15 is taken. B37 is taken. B19 is 294. C53 is 322. B69 is 312. C84 is 853. A96 is 206. B43 is 604. A88 is 454. C72 is 985. So no items with effort &lt;=22. So after adding A97, we can&#x27;t add anything else. So total effort 7329, importance 9093.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. Let me check if adding other items instead of A97 could give higher importance. For example, after B23 (7179), maybe add C82 (181) which is 181. 7179+181=7360, which is over. So no. B81 is 190, same issue. A28 is 231. Also over. B34 is 224. Over. C53 is 322. Over. B69 is 312. Over. C84 is 853. Over. A96 is 206. 7179+206=7385, over. B43 is 604. Over. A88 is 454. Over. C72 is 985. Over. So only A97 (150) is possible. So adding A97 gives 7329, which is under 7351. So that&#x27;s the best possible.<br/><br/>So the selected items would be: C51, A25, C79, A46, A39, B37, B15, A08, B95, A65, B64, C83, C10, B16, C60, A71, B23, A97.<br/><br/>Wait, let me check the order again. Let me list all the items added in order:<br/><br/>1. C51 (45)<br/>2. A25 (65)<br/>3. C79 (61)<br/>4. A46 (60)<br/>5. A39 (96)<br/>6. B37 (92)<br/>7. B15 (101)<br/>8. A08 (518)<br/>9. B95 (656)<br/>10. A65 (780)<br/>11. B64 (826)<br/>12. C83 (900)<br/>13. C10 (744)<br/>14. B16 (814)<br/>15. C60 (813)<br/>16. A71 (454)<br/>17. B23 (154)<br/>18. A97 (150)<br/><br/>Total effort: 45+65=110; +61=171; +60=231; +96=327; +92=419; +101=520; +518=1038; +656=1694; +780=2474; +826=3300; +900=4200; +744=4944; +814=5758; +813=6571; +454=7025; +154=7179; +150=7329. Yes, total 7329. Importance sum: 143+163=306; +159=465; +158=623; +194=817; +190=1007; +199=1206; +616=1822; +754=2576; +878=3454; +924=4378; +998=5376; +842=6218; +912=7130; +911=8041; +552=8593; +252=8845; +248=9093.<br/><br/>So total importance 9093. That&#x27;s a good number. But is this the maximum possible? Maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, maybe replacing some items with higher importance but similar effort. But given the time constraints, this seems a solid approach.<br/><br/>Now, the next step is to propose this set. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 7351. 7329 is under, so that&#x27;s okay. So the proposal would be the set of these items. However, the problem is that the other participant might have different importance values, so their proposal might be different. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to proceed with my own.<br/><br/>But in the negotiation, I need to propose a set. So the first step is to make a proposal. The initial proposal would be the set I calculated. However, maybe I should start with a smaller set to see if the other party is willing to agree, but since the goal is to maximize my own importance, perhaps proposing the optimal set is better.<br/><br/>But in a negotiation, sometimes you need to make concessions. However, since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, it&#x27;s hard to adjust. So the best approach is to propose the set that maximizes my own importance, which is the one I calculated.<br/><br/>So the first message would be a PROPOSAL with the set of items I listed. Then, depending on the other&#x27;s response, I might need to adjust. But since the user is asking for the first message, I need to generate the initial proposal.<br/><br/>But wait, the user&#x27;s instruction says that I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING at the beginning of every message. So in the first message, I need to have STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL.<br/><br/>So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit. By selecting items like C51, A25, and others with high ratios, I aim to accumulate as much importance as possible without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;C51&#x27;, &#x27;A25&#x27;, &#x27;C79&#x27;, &#x27;A46&#x27;, &#x27;A39&#x27;, &#x27;B37&#x27;, &#x27;B15&#x27;, &#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B95&#x27;, &#x27;A65&#x27;, &#x27;B64&#x27;, &#x27;C83&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;B16&#x27;, &#x27;C60&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;B23&#x27;, &#x27;A97&#x27;}<br/><br/>But I need to check if this set is under the limit. As calculated, 7329, which is under 7351. So that&#x27;s valid.<br/><br/>However, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, maybe replacing some items. Let me check if there&#x27;s a way to include more high-importance items. For instance, A97 has a high ratio (1.653) and effort 150. Adding it is good. What about A96 (206 effort, 304 importance)? If I can&#x27;t add it, but maybe replacing some items. But given the current total, adding A97 is the best.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe removing some lower ratio items to add higher ones. But in the current selection, all items are high ratio. So this seems optimal.<br/><br/>Therefore, the initial proposal is as above. Then, the next step would be to wait for the other&#x27;s response. If they refuse, I might need to adjust. But for the first message, this is the plan.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me structure my next response properly. The user also mentioned that the strategic reasoning should be a hidden message, so I need to include that first. Then follow with the ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL as before.<br/><br/>Wait, in my first attempt, I had STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. But maybe the user wants the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the very first thing, even before any other content. Let me confirm the rules: &quot;You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.&quot; So yes, the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/><br/>In my previous response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING first, but maybe the formatting was off. Let me make sure that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} with the content inside. Then proceed with ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. The user&#x27;s error message says the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. So I need to ensure that in the next response, the first thing is that tag.<br/><br/>Alright, I&#x27;ll adjust my response to start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then include the ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. That should comply with the protocol. Let me draft that now.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let me figure out what&#x27;s going wrong here. The user is saying that my response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. Looking at my previous attempts, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting is off.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s instruction says the very first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my last response, I had STRATEGIC REASONING first, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. But maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING isn&#x27;t the absolute first line. Let me check the exact structure.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s example shows that the first thing in the message should be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my previous messages, I did that. But perhaps the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING isn&#x27;t the first element in the message. Let me make sure that in the response, the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} without any other text before it.<br/><br/>In my last attempt, the first line was STRATEGIC REASONING: ... followed by ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. But maybe the user expects that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the only thing in the first line, and nothing else comes before it. Let me confirm the exact requirement.<br/><br/>The rules state: &quot;You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.&quot; So the first thing in the message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. If there&#x27;s any text before that, it&#x27;s invalid. In my previous responses, I started with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting wasn&#x27;t correct. For example, maybe there was a space or something else before it. Or perhaps the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and nothing else is present before it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that checks for the exact structure, and if there&#x27;s any other content before STRATEGIC REASONING, it&#x27;s considered invalid. So I need to ensure that the first line of my response is exactly &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot; with no other text before it.<br/><br/>In my previous attempts, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: ... <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: ...<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: ...<br/><br/>But maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the only thing in the first line, and the rest follows. However, the user&#x27;s example shows that after STRATEGIC REASONING, other tags can follow. But perhaps the issue is that in my response, the STRATEGIC REASONING is not the very first thing. Wait, in the user&#x27;s error message, they said &quot;Your response did not start with the proper strategic reasoning tag at the very beginning of your response.&quot; So the first line must be STRATEGIC REASONING. <br/><br/>Looking at my last response, the first line was &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...&quot; which should be correct. But maybe the user is using a parser that expects the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first element, and if there&#x27;s any other text before it, it&#x27;s invalid. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message follows. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the problem is that in my response, the STRATEGIC REASONING is not the first line. Let me check. In the last response, the first line was &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...&quot; which is correct. But maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and if there&#x27;s any other content before it, it&#x27;s considered invalid. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is structured properly. Since the user is getting an error, perhaps I need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the very first line, with no other text before it. <br/><br/>In my previous responses, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING. But maybe the formatting is incorrect. For example, maybe the colon and space after the tag are not properly placed. The user&#x27;s example shows &quot;TAG: {...}&quot; with a colon and whitespace. So the correct format is &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot;.<br/><br/>In my last response, I had &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...&quot; which should be correct. But perhaps the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and if there&#x27;s any other text before it, it&#x27;s invalid. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and the rest of the message is structured with other tags. Since the user is getting an error, I need to ensure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, and nothing else comes before it. <br/><br/>So, to fix this, I should make sure that the first line of my response is exactly &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot; with no other text before it. Let me try that again.<br/></p>
