Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 6938<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;A08&quot;: 997, &quot;B95&quot;: 950, &quot;A39&quot;: 272, &quot;A65&quot;: 448, &quot;B81&quot;: 382, &quot;B34&quot;: 804, &quot;A28&quot;: 237, &quot;C82&quot;: 56, &quot;B69&quot;: 105, &quot;A87&quot;: 612, &quot;B64&quot;: 528, &quot;B15&quot;: 527, &quot;C79&quot;: 524, &quot;B16&quot;: 167, &quot;C53&quot;: 133, &quot;C83&quot;: 300, &quot;C10&quot;: 945, &quot;A97&quot;: 50, &quot;A25&quot;: 906, &quot;C84&quot;: 70, &quot;A71&quot;: 224, &quot;B23&quot;: 4, &quot;B96&quot;: 689, &quot;C51&quot;: 64, &quot;C17&quot;: 434, &quot;B19&quot;: 750, &quot;C72&quot;: 733, &quot;A94&quot;: 873, &quot;A46&quot;: 22, &quot;B43&quot;: 68, &quot;B37&quot;: 57, &quot;A88&quot;: 10, &quot;A96&quot;: 36, &quot;C60&quot;: 551, &quot;A75&quot;: 348}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;A08&quot;: 1096, &quot;B95&quot;: 1049, &quot;A39&quot;: 371, &quot;A65&quot;: 547, &quot;B81&quot;: 481, &quot;B34&quot;: 903, &quot;A28&quot;: 336, &quot;C82&quot;: 155, &quot;B69&quot;: 204, &quot;A87&quot;: 711, &quot;B64&quot;: 627, &quot;B15&quot;: 626, &quot;C79&quot;: 623, &quot;B16&quot;: 266, &quot;C53&quot;: 232, &quot;C83&quot;: 399, &quot;C10&quot;: 1044, &quot;A97&quot;: 149, &quot;A25&quot;: 1005, &quot;C84&quot;: 169, &quot;A71&quot;: 323, &quot;B23&quot;: 103, &quot;B96&quot;: 788, &quot;C51&quot;: 163, &quot;C17&quot;: 533, &quot;B19&quot;: 849, &quot;C72&quot;: 832, &quot;A94&quot;: 972, &quot;A46&quot;: 121, &quot;B43&quot;: 167, &quot;B37&quot;: 156, &quot;A88&quot;: 109, &quot;A96&quot;: 135, &quot;C60&quot;: 650, &quot;A75&quot;: 447}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT.

The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 6938. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>A08:997, B95:950, A39:272, A65:448, B81:382, B34:804, A28:237, C82:56, B69:105, A87:612, B64:528, B15:527, C79:524, B16:167, C53:133, C83:300, C10:945, A97:50, A25:906, C84:70, A71:224, B23:4, B96:689, C51:64, C17:434, B19:750, C72:733, A94:873, A46:22, B43:68, B37:57, A88:10, A96:36, C60:551, A75:447.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step. Let me start adding:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add 997 (A08) → 997<br/><br/>+950 (B95) → 1947<br/><br/>+272 (A39) → 2219<br/><br/>+448 (A65) → 2667<br/><br/>+382 (B81) → 3049<br/><br/>+804 (B34) → 3853<br/><br/>+237 (A28) → 4090<br/><br/>+56 (C82) → 4146<br/><br/>+105 (B69) → 4251<br/><br/>+612 (A87) → 4863<br/><br/>+528 (B64) → 5391<br/><br/>+527 (B15) → 5918<br/><br/>+524 (C79) → 6442<br/><br/>+167 (B16) → 6609<br/><br/>+133 (C53) → 6742<br/><br/>+300 (C83) → 7042. Oh wait, that&#x27;s already over 6938. So the total effort of all items is 7042, which exceeds the limit. So we can&#x27;t take everything. Need to select a subset.<br/><br/>So the challenge is to pick items with high importance to me, but low effort, to maximize my total importance without exceeding 6938.<br/><br/>My importance values are given. Let me list them:<br/><br/>A08:1096, B95:1049, A39:371, A65:547, B81:481, B34:903, A28:336, C82:155, B69:204, A87:711, B64:627, B15:626, C79:623, B16:266, C53:232, C83:399, C10:1044, A97:149, A25:1005, C84:169, A71:323, B23:103, B96:788, C51:163, C17:533, B19:849, C72:832, A94:972, A46:121, B43:167, B37:156, A88:109, A96:135, C60:650, A75:447.<br/><br/>So the highest importance items for me are A08 (1096), B95 (1049), C10 (1044), A25 (1005), B19 (849), A94 (972), B96 (788), C72 (832), etc.<br/><br/>But their efforts are:<br/><br/>A08:997, B95:950, C10:945, A25:906, B19:750, A94:873, B96:689, C72:733.<br/><br/>So taking the top items by importance would require a lot of effort. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>If I take A08 (997), B95 (950), C10 (945), that&#x27;s 997+950=1947+945=2892. Then adding A25 (906) would make 2892+906=3798. Then B19 (750) → 3798+750=4548. A94 (873) → 4548+873=5421. B96 (689) → 5421+689=6110. C72 (733) → 6110+733=6843. That&#x27;s under 6938. Then maybe add more. Let&#x27;s check the remaining effort: 6938-6843=95. So maybe add items with effort &lt;=95. Looking at the list, C82 is 56, C53 is 133 (too much), C84 is 70, A88 is 10, A96 is 36, B23 is 4, etc. So adding C82 (56) would bring total to 6843+56=6899. Then maybe A88 (10) → 6909, A96 (36) → 6945 which is over. So maybe 6899 + 10 (A88) = 6909. Then maybe B23 (4) → 6913. Then C51 (64) would be 6913+64=6977 which is over. So maybe 6909 + 4 (B23) = 6913. Then maybe C84 (70) would be 6913+70=6983 over. So the maximum possible with these items is 6913. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing some high effort items with lower ones. For example, if I take A08 (997), B95 (950), C10 (945), A25 (906), B19 (750), A94 (873), B96 (689), C72 (733). Let&#x27;s sum their efforts:<br/><br/>997 + 950 = 1947<br/><br/>+945 = 2892<br/><br/>+906 = 3798<br/><br/>+750 = 4548<br/><br/>+873 = 5421<br/><br/>+689 = 6110<br/><br/>+733 = 6843. Total effort 6843. Remaining 6938-6843=95. So can add items with effort up to 95. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C82 (56), A88 (10), A96 (36), B23 (4), C51 (64), C84 (70). So adding C82 (56) → 6843+56=6899. Then A88 (10) → 6909. Then B23 (4) → 6913. Then C51 (64) would be 6913+64=6977 over. So total importance would be sum of those items&#x27; importance.<br/><br/>Calculating the importance for these items:<br/><br/>A08:1096, B95:1049, C10:1044, A25:1005, B19:849, A94:972, B96:788, C72:832, C82:155, A88:109, B23:103.<br/><br/>Sum these up:<br/><br/>1096 + 1049 = 2145<br/><br/>+1044 = 3189<br/><br/>+1005 = 4194<br/><br/>+849 = 5043<br/><br/>+972 = 6015<br/><br/>+788 = 6803<br/><br/>+832 = 7635<br/><br/>+155 = 7790<br/><br/>+109 = 7899<br/><br/>+103 = 8002.<br/><br/>So total importance 8002. That&#x27;s a good start. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items. Alternatively, maybe some items with lower effort but higher importance. For example, C82 (155) is low effort but maybe not as important as others. But since I can&#x27;t take all, need to prioritize.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing some items. For example, if I take A08, B95, C10, A25, B19, A94, B96, C72, and then add C82, A88, B23. That&#x27;s 8 items plus 3 more. But the effort is 6843 + 56+10+4=6913. So that&#x27;s under 6938. So total importance would be 8002. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe not taking some high effort items. For example, if I don&#x27;t take A08 (997 effort, 1096 importance), but take other items. But that would probably lower the total importance. So it&#x27;s better to take the high importance items.<br/><br/>Another approach: sort items by importance per effort ratio. That might help in selecting items that give the most importance per unit of effort. Let me calculate that.<br/><br/>For each item, importance / effort:<br/><br/>A08: 1096 / 997 ≈ 1.10<br/><br/>B95: 1049 / 950 ≈ 1.10<br/><br/>C10: 1044 / 945 ≈ 1.10<br/><br/>A25: 1005 / 906 ≈ 1.11<br/><br/>B19: 849 / 750 ≈ 1.13<br/><br/>A94: 972 / 873 ≈ 1.11<br/><br/>B96: 788 / 689 ≈ 1.14<br/><br/>C72: 832 / 733 ≈ 1.13<br/><br/>B64: 627 / 528 ≈ 1.19<br/><br/>A65: 547 / 448 ≈ 1.22<br/><br/>B81: 481 / 382 ≈ 1.26<br/><br/>C53: 232 / 133 ≈ 1.74<br/><br/>C83: 399 / 300 ≈ 1.33<br/><br/>B16: 266 / 167 ≈ 1.59<br/><br/>C51: 163 / 64 ≈ 2.55<br/><br/>A88: 109 / 10 = 10.9<br/><br/>A96: 135 / 36 ≈ 3.75<br/><br/>B23: 103 / 4 = 25.75<br/><br/>C84: 169 / 70 ≈ 2.41<br/><br/>A75: 447 / 447 = 1.0<br/><br/>A46: 121 / 22 ≈ 5.5<br/><br/>B43: 167 / 68 ≈ 2.46<br/><br/>B37: 156 / 57 ≈ 2.74<br/><br/>C60: 650 / 551 ≈ 1.18<br/><br/>A71: 323 / 224 ≈ 1.44<br/><br/>B34: 903 / 804 ≈ 1.12<br/><br/>A39: 371 / 272 ≈ 1.36<br/><br/>B69: 204 / 105 ≈ 1.94<br/><br/>C79: 623 / 524 ≈ 1.19<br/><br/>C82: 155 / 56 ≈ 2.77<br/><br/>C17: 533 / 434 ≈ 1.23<br/><br/>A97: 149 / 50 ≈ 2.98<br/><br/>A28: 336 / 237 ≈ 1.42<br/><br/>B43: 167 / 68 ≈ 2.46<br/><br/>B37: 156 / 57 ≈ 2.74<br/><br/>C51: 163 / 64 ≈ 2.55<br/><br/>C84: 169 / 70 ≈ 2.41<br/><br/>A96: 135 / 36 ≈ 3.75<br/><br/>A88: 109 / 10 = 10.9<br/><br/>B23: 103 / 4 = 25.75<br/><br/>So the highest ratios are B23 (25.75), A88 (10.9), A96 (3.75), C51 (2.55), C84 (2.41), B43 (2.46), C83 (1.33), etc.<br/><br/>So if I prioritize items with high importance per effort, I can get more importance for less effort. For example, B23 (effort 4, importance 103) is very efficient. Similarly, A88 (effort 10, importance 109) is also good. A96 (effort 36, 135) is better than some others.<br/><br/>So maybe a strategy is to take items with high importance per effort first, then fill in the remaining effort with other items.<br/><br/>Let me try that approach. Start with the highest ratios:<br/><br/>B23 (4, 103), A88 (10, 109), A96 (36, 135), C51 (64, 163), C84 (70, 169), B43 (68, 167), C83 (300, 399), B64 (528, 627), etc.<br/><br/>But need to check the total effort. Let&#x27;s start adding:<br/><br/>Start with B23 (4) → total effort 4, importance 103.<br/><br/>Add A88 (10) → total 14, importance 212.<br/><br/>Add A96 (36) → total 50, importance 347.<br/><br/>Add C51 (64) → total 114, importance 510.<br/><br/>Add C84 (70) → total 184, importance 679.<br/><br/>Add B43 (68) → total 252, importance 846.<br/><br/>Add C83 (300) → total 552, importance 1245.<br/><br/>Add B64 (528) → total 1080, importance 1872.<br/><br/>Add B96 (689) → total 1769, importance 2500.<br/><br/>Add A94 (873) → total 2642, importance 3472.<br/><br/>Add B19 (750) → total 3392, importance 4322.<br/><br/>Add A25 (906) → total 4298, importance 5328.<br/><br/>Add C10 (945) → total 5243, importance 6373.<br/><br/>Add B95 (950) → total 6193, which is over 6938. So can&#x27;t add B95. So need to stop here. Wait, 5243 + 950 = 6193? Wait 5243 + 950 is 6193? No, 5243 + 950 is 6193? Wait 5243 + 950 is 6193? Let me check: 5243 + 900 = 6143, +50 = 6193. Yes. But 6193 is under 6938. So maybe add more.<br/><br/>Wait, after adding B95 (950), total effort is 5243 + 950 = 6193. Then remaining effort is 6938 - 6193 = 745. So can add more items.<br/><br/>Next, maybe A08 (997) is too much (6193 + 997 = 7190 &gt; 6938). So can&#x27;t. What about other items?<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort &lt;= 745. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>A39 (272), A65 (448), B81 (382), B34 (804) (too much), A28 (237), C82 (56), B69 (105), A87 (612), B15 (527), C79 (524), B16 (167), C53 (133), C17 (434), A71 (224), B23 (already taken), B96 (taken), C51 (taken), C84 (taken), B43 (taken), C83 (taken), A96 (taken), A88 (taken), B23 (taken).<br/><br/>So possible items: A39 (272), A65 (448), B81 (382), A28 (237), C82 (56), B69 (105), A87 (612), B15 (527), C79 (524), B16 (167), C53 (133), C17 (434), A71 (224), etc.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s try adding A39 (272). 6193 + 272 = 6465. Importance 6373 + 371 = 6744.<br/><br/>Then A65 (448): 6465 + 448 = 6913. Importance 6744 + 547 = 7291.<br/><br/>Now total effort is 6913. Remaining 6938 - 6913 = 25. So can add items with effort &lt;=25. Looking at the list:<br/><br/>A46 (22), B37 (57) no, B23 (4) is already taken. A88 (10) is taken. A96 (36) is taken. C51 (64) is taken. So A46 (22) is possible. Add A46 (22) → total effort 6913 +22=6935. Importance 7291 +121=7412.<br/><br/>Now remaining effort is 3. Can&#x27;t add anything else. So total importance is 7412.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after adding A65 (448) to reach 6913, maybe instead of A46, add other items. But 25 is the remaining. So A46 is the only one. So that&#x27;s 7412.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe after adding B95, instead of adding A39 and A65, maybe other combinations. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after adding B95 (total 6193), maybe add C10 (945) first. Wait, but C10&#x27;s effort is 945. 6193 + 945 = 7138 which is over. So can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after B95, add A25 (906). 6193 + 906 = 7099, which is over. So no.<br/><br/>So the previous approach gives 7412. But maybe there&#x27;s a better way.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe not taking B95. Let&#x27;s see. If I don&#x27;t take B95 (950 effort, 1049 importance), but take other items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Suppose I take B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, A94, B19, A25, C10. Wait, but that&#x27;s the same as before. Maybe replacing B95 with other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe take B95 but not some other items. For example, if I take B95 (950), but skip some other high effort items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>But this is getting complicated. The key is to find a set that maximizes my importance without exceeding the limit. Since I can&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, I have to focus on my own.<br/><br/>Another approach: use a knapsack algorithm. Since this is a 0-1 knapsack problem where each item can be taken or not, and the goal is to maximize the sum of importance with total effort &lt;= 6938.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t compute it here manually, I need to approximate.<br/><br/>The previous approach gave 7412. Let me check if that&#x27;s possible. Let me recount the items:<br/><br/>B23 (4), A88 (10), A96 (36), C51 (64), C84 (70), B43 (68), C83 (300), B64 (528), A94 (873), B19 (750), A25 (906), C10 (945). Wait, but adding all these would be:<br/><br/>4 +10=14, +36=50, +64=114, +70=184, +68=252, +300=552, +528=1080, +873=1953, +750=2703, +906=3609, +945=4554. Wait, that&#x27;s way under 6938. So maybe I missed some steps. Wait, earlier steps had more items. Maybe I need to recheck.<br/><br/>Wait, in the previous calculation, after adding B95 (950), the total was 6193. Then adding A39 (272) → 6465, then A65 (448) → 6913. Then A46 (22) → 6935. So total items are B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, A94, B19, A25, C10, A39, A65, A46. That&#x27;s 15 items. Let me check the total effort:<br/><br/>4 (B23) +10 (A88) +36 (A96) +64 (C51) +70 (C84) +68 (B43) +300 (C83) +528 (B64) +873 (A94) +750 (B19) +906 (A25) +945 (C10) +272 (A39) +448 (A65) +22 (A46).<br/><br/>Let me add them step by step:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>+4 =4<br/><br/>+10=14<br/><br/>+36=50<br/><br/>+64=114<br/><br/>+70=184<br/><br/>+68=252<br/><br/>+300=552<br/><br/>+528=1080<br/><br/>+873=1953<br/><br/>+750=2703<br/><br/>+906=3609<br/><br/>+945=4554<br/><br/>+272=4826<br/><br/>+448=5274<br/><br/>+22=5296.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s only 5296. But earlier I thought it was 6913. There&#x27;s a mistake here. Oh, I think I messed up the order. Let me re-calculate the total effort correctly.<br/><br/>Wait, the previous steps were:<br/><br/>After adding B95 (950), total effort was 6193. Then adding A39 (272) → 6193 + 272 = 6465.<br/><br/>Then A65 (448) → 6465 + 448 = 6913.<br/><br/>Then A46 (22) → 6913 +22=6935.<br/><br/>So total effort is 6935. So the items added after B95 are A39, A65, A46. So total items are B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, A94, B19, A25, C10, A39, A65, A46. Let me sum their efforts:<br/><br/>B23:4<br/><br/>A88:10 → 14<br/><br/>A96:36 → 50<br/><br/>C51:64 → 114<br/><br/>C84:70 → 184<br/><br/>B43:68 → 252<br/><br/>C83:300 → 552<br/><br/>B64:528 → 1080<br/><br/>A94:873 → 1953<br/><br/>B19:750 → 2703<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3609<br/><br/>C10:945 → 4554<br/><br/>A39:272 → 4826<br/><br/>A65:448 → 5274<br/><br/>A46:22 → 5296.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s only 5296. But earlier I thought it was 6913. There&#x27;s a discrepancy here. Oh, I think I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Because when I added B95 (950) to the previous total of 5243 (from earlier steps), that would be 5243 + 950 = 6193. Then adding A39 (272) → 6193 + 272 = 6465. Then A65 (448) → 6465 + 448 = 6913. Then A46 (22) → 6913 +22=6935. So the total effort is 6935. So the items added after B95 are A39, A65, A46. So the total items are:<br/><br/>B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, A94, B19, A25, C10, A39, A65, A46. Let me check the sum again:<br/><br/>B23:4<br/><br/>A88:10 → 14<br/><br/>A96:36 → 50<br/><br/>C51:64 → 114<br/><br/>C84:70 → 184<br/><br/>B43:68 → 252<br/><br/>C83:300 → 552<br/><br/>B64:528 → 1080<br/><br/>A94:873 → 1953<br/><br/>B19:750 → 2703<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3609<br/><br/>C10:945 → 4554<br/><br/>A39:272 → 4826<br/><br/>A65:448 → 5274<br/><br/>A46:22 → 5296.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 5296. But according to the previous steps, after adding B95, the total was 6193. So where is the mistake? Oh, I think I confused the order. The initial steps before adding B95 were:<br/><br/>B23 (4), A88 (10), A96 (36), C51 (64), C84 (70), B43 (68), C83 (300), B64 (528), A94 (873), B19 (750), A25 (906), C10 (945). Let&#x27;s sum these:<br/><br/>4 +10=14<br/><br/>+36=50<br/><br/>+64=114<br/><br/>+70=184<br/><br/>+68=252<br/><br/>+300=552<br/><br/>+528=1080<br/><br/>+873=1953<br/><br/>+750=2703<br/><br/>+906=3609<br/><br/>+945=4554.<br/><br/>So that&#x27;s 4554. Then adding B95 (950) would make 4554 + 950 = 5504. Then adding A39 (272) → 5504 + 272 = 5776. Then A65 (448) → 5776 + 448 = 6224. Then A46 (22) → 6224 +22=6246. That&#x27;s way under 6938. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation. This suggests that my previous approach was incorrect. So I need to re-examine.<br/><br/>This indicates that my initial approach was flawed. So I need to re-calculate.<br/><br/>Let me start over. Let&#x27;s try to build the set step by step, prioritizing high importance per effort.<br/><br/>First, list all items sorted by importance per effort (highest first):<br/><br/>B23 (25.75), A88 (10.9), A96 (3.75), C51 (2.55), C84 (2.41), B43 (2.46), C83 (1.33), B64 (1.19), C79 (1.19), B16 (1.59), C53 (1.74), C17 (1.23), A97 (2.98), A46 (5.5), B37 (2.74), C60 (1.18), A71 (1.44), B34 (1.12), A39 (1.36), B69 (1.94), C82 (2.77), A65 (1.22), B81 (1.26), A28 (1.42), A75 (1.0), A08 (1.10), B95 (1.10), C10 (1.10).<br/><br/>So the top items are B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, etc.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s start adding these:<br/><br/>Start with B23 (4, 103). Total effort 4, importance 103.<br/><br/>Add A88 (10, 109). Total 14, 212.<br/><br/>Add A96 (36, 135). Total 86, 347.<br/><br/>Add C51 (64, 163). Total 150, 510.<br/><br/>Add C84 (70, 169). Total 220, 679.<br/><br/>Add B43 (68, 167). Total 288, 846.<br/><br/>Add C83 (300, 399). Total 588, 1245.<br/><br/>Add B64 (528, 627). Total 1116, 1872.<br/><br/>Add C79 (524, 623). Total 1642, 2495.<br/><br/>Add B16 (167, 266). Total 1809, 2157.<br/><br/>Add C53 (133, 232). Total 1942, 2389.<br/><br/>Add C17 (434, 533). Total 2376, 2922.<br/><br/>Add A97 (50, 149). Total 2426, 2971.<br/><br/>Add A46 (22, 121). Total 2448, 3092.<br/><br/>Add B37 (57, 156). Total 2505, 3248.<br/><br/>Add C60 (551, 650). Total 3056, 3898.<br/><br/>Add A71 (224, 323). Total 3280, 4221.<br/><br/>Add B34 (804, 903). Total 4084, 5131.<br/><br/>Add A65 (448, 547). Total 4532, 5678.<br/><br/>Add A28 (237, 336). Total 4769, 6014.<br/><br/>Add A08 (997, 1096). Total 5766, 7110.<br/><br/>Add B95 (950, 1049). Total 6716, 8159.<br/><br/>Now, total effort is 6716. Remaining is 6938 - 6716 = 222. So can add items with effort &lt;=222.<br/><br/>Looking for items not yet taken. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Available items: A39 (272) is over 222. A65 is already taken. B81 (382) over. B34 taken. C82 (56), B69 (105), A87 (612) over, B15 (527) over, C72 (733) over, A94 (873) over, B19 (750) over, C10 (945) over, etc.<br/><br/>So possible items: C82 (56), B69 (105), C82 (56), A88 (already taken), A96 (taken), etc.<br/><br/>So add C82 (56) → total 6716 +56=6772. Importance 8159 +155=8314.<br/><br/>Remaining effort: 6938 - 6772 = 166. Can add items with effort &lt;=166.<br/><br/>Possible items: B69 (105), C84 (already taken), B43 (taken), C53 (taken), C17 (taken), A97 (taken), A46 (taken), B37 (taken), C60 (taken), A71 (taken), B34 (taken), A65 (taken), A28 (taken), A08 (taken), B95 (taken). So maybe B69 (105) → 6772 +105=6877. Importance 8314 +204=8518. Remaining 6938-6877=61. Can add items with effort &lt;=61. Like C84 (70) is over. A88 (10) is taken. A96 (36) is taken. C51 (64) is over. C83 (300) over. B64 (528) over. So maybe A88 (10) is already taken. So maybe add A96 (36) but it&#x27;s already taken. Or C51 (64) is over. So no. So total importance is 8518.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after adding C82 (56), remaining 166. Maybe add B69 (105) and then C84 (70) is over. Or B69 (105) and then C84 (70) is 105+70=175 which is over 166. So can&#x27;t. So only B69 (105) can be added. So total importance 8518.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after adding B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, C79, B16, C53, C17, A97, A46, B37, C60, A71, B34, A65, A28, A08, B95. That&#x27;s a lot of items. But the total effort is 6716. Then adding C82 (56) and B69 (105) gives 6716+56+105=6877. Then remaining 61. Maybe add A88 (10) but it&#x27;s already taken. Or A96 (36) is taken. So no. So total importance 8518.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, instead of taking B95 (950 effort, 1049 importance), maybe take other items. Let&#x27;s see. If I don&#x27;t take B95, but take other items. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>Suppose I take B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, C79, B16, C53, C17, A97, A46, B37, C60, A71, B34, A65, A28. That&#x27;s 20 items. Let&#x27;s calculate their total effort:<br/><br/>4 +10 +36 +64 +70 +68 +300 +528 +524 +167 +133 +434 +50 +22 +57 +551 +224 +804 +448 +237.<br/><br/>Let me add them step by step:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>+4=4<br/><br/>+10=14<br/><br/>+36=50<br/><br/>+64=114<br/><br/>+70=184<br/><br/>+68=252<br/><br/>+300=552<br/><br/>+528=1080<br/><br/>+524=1604<br/><br/>+167=1771<br/><br/>+133=1904<br/><br/>+434=2338<br/><br/>+50=2388<br/><br/>+22=2410<br/><br/>+57=2467<br/><br/>+551=3018<br/><br/>+224=3242<br/><br/>+804=4046<br/><br/>+448=4494<br/><br/>+237=4731.<br/><br/>Total effort 4731. Remaining 6938-4731=2207. So can add more items. For example, B95 (950) would bring total to 4731+950=5681. Then A39 (272) → 5681+272=5953. A65 (448) → 5953+448=6401. A46 (22) → 6401+22=6423. C10 (945) → 6423+945=7368 which is over. So can&#x27;t. So after adding B95, A39, A65, A46, total effort is 5681+272+448+22=5681+742=6423. Remaining 6938-6423=515. So can add more items. For example, C10 (945) is over. B19 (750) over. A94 (873) over. B69 (105) → 6423+105=6528. Then C82 (56) → 6528+56=6584. Then A88 (10) → 6594. A96 (36) → 6630. C51 (64) → 6694. C84 (70) → 6764. B43 (68) → 6832. C83 (300) → 7132 over. So maybe add B69 (105) and C82 (56) and A88 (10) and A96 (36) and C51 (64). Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>6423 +105=6528<br/><br/>+56=6584<br/><br/>+10=6594<br/><br/>+36=6630<br/><br/>+64=6694. Total effort 6694. Remaining 6938-6694=244. Can add more items. For example, B19 (750) is over. A94 (873) over. B64 (528) over. C79 (524) over. B16 (167) → 6694+167=6861. Then C53 (133) → 6861+133=6994 over. So can&#x27;t. So total importance would be 3092 (from previous items) + 1049 (B95) + 371 (A39) + 547 (A65) + 121 (A46) + 204 (B69) + 155 (C82) + 10 (A88) + 36 (A96) + 64 (C51) + 167 (B16) + 232 (C53) + 533 (C17) + 149 (A97) + 650 (C60) + 323 (A71) + 903 (B34) + 547 (A65) + 336 (A28). Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe this approach isn&#x27;t better than the previous one.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial approach of taking high importance per effort items gives a better total. But I need to find the optimal set. Since this is time-consuming, perhaps the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest importance items with manageable effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since the other participant&#x27;s importance is unknown, I should propose a set that I think is good for me, and then negotiate. But since I can&#x27;t know their preferences, I have to focus on my own.<br/><br/>So, based on the previous calculation, the set including B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, A94, B19, A25, C10, A39, A65, A46 gives a total effort of 5296, which is under 6938. But that&#x27;s not utilizing the full limit. So maybe adding more items.<br/><br/>Wait, in that set, the total effort is 5296. So there&#x27;s 6938 - 5296 = 1642 left. So I can add more items. For example, B95 (950) would bring it to 5296+950=6246. Then A39 (272) → 6246+272=6518. A65 (448) → 6518+448=6966 which is over. So can&#x27;t. So after B95, A39, A65, A46, total effort is 5296 + 950 + 272 + 448 + 22 = 5296 + 1692 = 6988, which is over. So need to adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after B23, A88, A96, C51, C84, B43, C83, B64, A94, B19, A25, C10, A39, A65, A46. Let me check the total effort again:<br/><br/>B23:4<br/><br/>A88:10 → 14<br/><br/>A96:36 → 50<br/><br/>C51:64 → 114<br/><br/>C84:70 → 184<br/><br/>B43:68 → 252<br/><br/>C83:300 → 552<br/><br/>B64:528 → 1080<br/><br/>A94:873 → 1953<br/><br/>B19:750 → 2703<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3609<br/><br/>C10:945 → 4554<br/><br/>A39:272 → 4826<br/><br/>A65:448 → 5274<br/><br/>A46:22 → 5296.<br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s 5296. So remaining 6938-5296=1642. So can add more items. Let&#x27;s see which items are left. The items not in the set are:<br/><br/>A08, B95, B34, C79, C17, B15, C72, A75, A97, C82, B69, etc.<br/><br/>So adding B95 (950) would bring total to 5296+950=6246. Then A39 (272) → 6246+272=6518. A65 (448) → 6518+448=6966 (over). So can&#x27;t. So after B95 and A39, total is 6246+272=6518. Remaining 6938-6518=420. So can add items with effort &lt;=420. For example, A65 (448) is over. B81 (382) → 6518+382=6900. Then remaining 38. Can add A88 (10) but already taken. A96 (36) is taken. C51 (64) over. C84 (70) over. B43 (68) over. C83 (300) over. B64 (528) over. C79 (524) over. B16 (167) over. C53 (133) over. C17 (434) over. A97 (50) → 6900+50=6950. Then A46 (22) → 6950+22=6972. Then B23 (4) is already taken. So total importance would be 7110 (from previous items) + 1049 (B95) + 371 (A39) + 382 (B81) + 50 (A97) + 22 (A46) = 7110 + 1049=8159 +371=8530 +382=8912 +50=8962 +22=8984. But wait, the previous items already included B23, A88, etc. So the total importance would be the sum of all those items. This is getting too complex.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest importance items with manageable effort. For example, A08, B95, C10, A25, B19, A94, B96, C72, and then fill in the remaining effort with lower effort items.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure the total effort is under 6938. Let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>A08:997<br/><br/>B95:950 → 1947<br/><br/>C10:945 → 2892<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3798<br/><br/>B19:750 → 4548<br/><br/>A94:873 → 5421<br/><br/>B96:689 → 6110<br/><br/>C72:733 → 6843.<br/><br/>Total effort 6843. Remaining 6938-6843=95. So can add items with effort &lt;=95. Like C82 (56), A88 (10), A96 (36), B23 (4), C51 (64), C84 (70). So adding C82 (56) → 6843+56=6899. Then A88 (10) → 6909. Then B23 (4) → 6913. Then C51 (64) would be 6913+64=6977 over. So total importance would be:<br/><br/>A08:1096<br/><br/>B95:1049<br/><br/>C10:1044<br/><br/>A25:1005<br/><br/>B19:849<br/><br/>A94:972<br/><br/>B96:788<br/><br/>C72:832<br/><br/>C82:155<br/><br/>A88:109<br/><br/>B23:103.<br/><br/>Sum these:<br/><br/>1096 + 1049 = 2145<br/><br/>+1044 = 3189<br/><br/>+1005 = 4194<br/><br/>+849 = 5043<br/><br/>+972 = 6015<br/><br/>+788 = 6803<br/><br/>+832 = 7635<br/><br/>+155 = 7790<br/><br/>+109 = 7899<br/><br/>+103 = 8002.<br/><br/>So total importance 8002. That&#x27;s better than the previous 7412. So this seems better. But is this possible? Let me check the effort:<br/><br/>A08:997<br/><br/>B95:950 → 1947<br/><br/>C10:945 → 2892<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3798<br/><br/>B19:750 → 4548<br/><br/>A94:873 → 5421<br/><br/>B96:689 → 6110<br/><br/>C72:733 → 6843.<br/><br/>Then adding C82 (56) → 6899<br/><br/>A88 (10) → 6909<br/><br/>B23 (4) → 6913.<br/><br/>Total effort 6913. Which is under 6938. So yes. So this set gives 8002 importance. That&#x27;s better than the previous 7412. So this is a better proposal.<br/><br/>But why didn&#x27;t I think of this earlier? Because I was adding items in a different order. So this seems like a better approach. So the set would be {A08, B95, C10, A25, B19, A94, B96, C72, C82, A88, B23}.<br/><br/>Let me check the total effort again:<br/><br/>997 + 950 = 1947<br/><br/>+945 = 2892<br/><br/>+906 = 3798<br/><br/>+750 = 4548<br/><br/>+873 = 5421<br/><br/>+689 = 6110<br/><br/>+733 = 6843<br/><br/>+56 = 6899<br/><br/>+10 = 6909<br/><br/>+4 = 6913.<br/><br/>Yes, 6913. So under 6938. So this is a valid set. The total importance is 8002. That&#x27;s a good number.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a way to add more items. For example, after 6913, remaining 25. Can add A46 (22) → 6913+22=6935. Importance 8002 +121=8123. Then remaining 3. Can&#x27;t add anything else. So total importance 8123. That&#x27;s better. So the set would be {A08, B95, C10, A25, B19, A94, B96, C72, C82, A88, B23, A46}.<br/><br/>Total effort: 6913 +22=6935. Which is under 6938. So that&#x27;s valid. So importance is 8002 +121=8123.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after 6913, add A96 (36) → 6913+36=6949 over. No. Or C51 (64) → 6913+64=6977 over. So A46 is the only one. So total importance 8123.<br/><br/>This seems better. So this set is better. So the proposal would be this set.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that all these items are included. Let me list them:<br/><br/>A08, B95, C10, A25, B19, A94, B96, C72, C82, A88, B23, A46.<br/><br/>Total effort: 6913 +22=6935. Yes.<br/><br/>So this is a valid proposal. The importance is 8123. That&#x27;s a good number. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to get even higher. For example, if I can add more items. Let&#x27;s see. After 6935, remaining 3. Can&#x27;t add anything. So that&#x27;s the maximum.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, instead of taking A46 (22), maybe take another item with higher importance. But with 3 left, no. So this seems optimal.<br/><br/>So the proposal would be this set. Now, I need to present this as a PROPOSAL. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 6938. Which it is.<br/><br/>So the first step is to propose this set. Then, depending on the other&#x27;s response, negotiate. But since I have to start with a proposal, I&#x27;ll go with this.<br/><br/>But wait, the user&#x27;s instruction says that I must include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING in each message. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden. So in my first message, I need to include STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, and then the PROPOSAL.<br/><br/>So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with high importance per effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By selecting items like B23 (high ratio), A88, A96, and others, I aim to accumulate high importance with minimal effort, allowing room for more items. This approach balances high-value items with efficient use of the effort limit.<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: I propose this set because it includes high-importance items with relatively low effort, ensuring a strong total while staying under the limit. This maximizes my personal gain without exceeding the shared constraint.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B95&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A25&#x27;, &#x27;B19&#x27;, &#x27;A94&#x27;, &#x27;B96&#x27;, &#x27;C72&#x27;, &#x27;C82&#x27;, &#x27;A88&#x27;, &#x27;B23&#x27;, &#x27;A46&#x27;}<br/><br/>But I need to check if this set is valid. Let me confirm the effort:<br/><br/>A08:997<br/><br/>B95:950 → 1947<br/><br/>C10:945 → 2892<br/><br/>A25:906 → 3798<br/><br/>B19:750 → 4548<br/><br/>A94:873 → 5421<br/><br/>B96:689 → 6110<br/><br/>C72:733 → 6843<br/><br/>C82:56 → 6899<br/><br/>A88:10 → 6909<br/><br/>B23:4 → 6913<br/><br/>A46:22 → 6935.<br/><br/>Yes, total 6935 ≤ 6938. So valid.<br/><br/>This seems like a solid proposal. Now, the next step is to send this proposal. The other participant might accept, refuse, or counter. But since I can&#x27;t know their response, I have to proceed with this proposal first.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me restructure my response. Start with that tag, then the argument, and then the proposal. Also, the argument needs to be included at least once. <br/><br/>In my first attempt, I had the strategic reasoning but maybe it wasn&#x27;t the first thing. Let me correct that. The user is strict about the order, so I have to follow it exactly. <br/><br/>Let me draft the strategic reasoning again, focusing on the same strategy but ensuring it&#x27;s the first part. Then the argument, then the proposal. Also, check that all structured formats are correctly formatted with the colon and whitespace. <br/><br/>Another thing: the user mentioned that the strategic reasoning is hidden, so I can include any reasoning there. Maybe I can elaborate a bit more on why those items are chosen. <br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s initial message had a limit of 6938. Let me verify the total effort of the proposed items. Let me calculate:<br/><br/>A08:997, B95:950, C10:945, A25:906, B19:750, A94:873, B96:689, C72:733, C82:56, A88:10, B23:4, A46:22. <br/><br/>Adding these up: 997+950=1947, +945=2892, +906=3798, +750=4548, +873=5421, +689=6110, +733=6843, +56=6899, +10=6909, +4=6913, +22=6935. That&#x27;s under 6938. So the proposal is valid. <br/><br/>The argument should defend this proposal. Maybe mention the high importance items and the low-effort ones. <br/><br/>So the corrected response should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. Let me make sure that&#x27;s the order. Also, check for any typos in the item names. <br/><br/>Yes, that should fix the issue. The user will see the proper structure now.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user is pointing out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the history.<br/><br/>In the first attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting was off. The user&#x27;s error message says the very first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me look at my first response again.<br/><br/>Wait, in the first response, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize... <br/><br/>Then ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. That seems correct. But the user is saying it&#x27;s not starting properly. Maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line isn&#x27;t the very first thing in the message. Let me check the exact structure.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}.&quot; So the first line of the response must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my first response, that was the case. But perhaps the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only thing in the first line, without any other text. Or maybe there was a formatting error in how I presented it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and any other text after that is not allowed. But in my response, after STRATEGIC REASONING, I had ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. However, according to the interaction protocol, each message can have multiple structured formats. The key is that the first one must be STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s error message says: &quot;Your response did not start with the proper strategic reasoning tag at the very beginning of your response.&quot; So the first line of the response must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my first response, that was correct. But maybe the user is expecting that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the only content in the first line, and no other text. Or perhaps there was a mistake in how I formatted it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and any other content after that is not considered. But in my response, after STRATEGIC REASONING, I had ARGUMENT and PROPOSAL. However, according to the rules, each message can have multiple structured formats. The key is that the first one must be STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/><br/>Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s initial instructions: &quot;You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.&quot; So each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING, and that&#x27;s the first thing. Then other tags can follow. So my first response was correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe there&#x27;s a formatting issue, like missing colon or whitespace.<br/><br/>Looking at my first response:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By focusing on high-value items like A08, B95, and C10, which offer significant importance with manageable effort, I aim to secure a strong baseline.

That seems correct. But maybe the user&#x27;s system is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the first line, without any other text. Or perhaps there&#x27;s a missing space after the colon. Let me check the exact syntax.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings. So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}&quot;<br/><br/>So the STRATEGIC REASONING line should be &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot;. In my response, I have &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize...&quot; which is correct. The colon is followed by a space. So that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe the user&#x27;s system is not parsing it correctly, or there&#x27;s a different issue. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only line in the message, but that&#x27;s not the case. The user&#x27;s instruction allows for other tags after STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and any other content after that is not allowed. But according to the rules, the message can have multiple structured formats. The key is that the first one is STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s error message says: &quot;The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}.&quot; So the first structured format in the message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my response, that&#x27;s the case. So why is the user getting an error?<br/><br/>Maybe the problem is that in the first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING line is not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax again. The user&#x27;s example shows that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be followed by a colon and whitespace. In my response, it&#x27;s &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize...&quot; which is correct. The colon is followed by a space. So that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only content in the first line, and no other text. But according to the rules, the message can have multiple structured formats. The first one must be STRATEGIC REASONING, and others can follow.<br/><br/>This is confusing. The user is getting an error, but my response seems to comply. Maybe there&#x27;s a typo in the tag name. Let me check: &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING&quot; with a space between STRATEGIC and REASONING. The user&#x27;s instruction says &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING&quot; with a space. So that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be in a specific format, like all caps or something else. But the user&#x27;s example shows &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot;.<br/><br/>I think the issue might be that in my first response, the STRATEGIC REASONING line is not the first line. Wait, no, in the first response, the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. So that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first line, and any other content after that is not allowed. But according to the rules, the message can have multiple structured formats. The first one must be STRATEGIC REASONING, and others can follow. So my response should be acceptable.<br/><br/>But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line is not properly formatted. Let me check again. The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}.&quot; So the first line must be exactly that. In my response, it is. So why the error?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a strict parser that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only line in the message. But that&#x27;s not the case. The user&#x27;s instruction allows for other tags after STRATEGIC REASONING.<br/><br/>This is perplexing. To resolve this, I&#x27;ll make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the very first line, with no other text before it. Let me reformat the response to ensure that. Maybe in the previous attempt, there was some leading whitespace or formatting issue. Let me try again, making sure that the first line is exactly &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: ...&quot;.<br/></p>

This strategy balances high-impact selections with flexibility for further adjustments.  <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: This proposal includes items with the highest personal importance and efficient effort usage, ensuring a strong total while leaving room for potential adjustments. It avoids overcommitting to high-effort items that might limit future options.  <br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B95&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A25&#x27;, &#x27;B19&#x27;, &#x27;A94&#x27;, &#x27;B96&#x27;, &#x27;C72&#x27;, &#x27;C82&#x27;, &#x27;A88&#x27;, &#x27;B23&#x27;, &#x27;A46&#x27;}</p>
