Including A30 (868/515 ≈ 1.68) and B26 (808/493 ≈ 1.64) further maximizes value while staying under the limit. The total effort here is 862+252+515+493+571+918+522+780 = 4891, which exceeds the limit. Wait—this is a problem! I miscalculated. Let me adjust.  \n\nRevised proposal: {'C47', 'B91', 'A30', 'B26', 'C75', 'A47', 'A15'}  \nTotal effort: 211+252+515+493+339+522+780 = 3102 ≤ 4379.  \nARGUMENT: This revised set prioritizes high-importance items like C47 (783/211) and B91 (583/252) while adding A30 (868/515) and B26 (808/493). C75 (65/339 ≈ 0.19) is included for its low effort, freeing up capacity for other items. A47 (508/522 ≈ 0.97) and A15 (780/803 ≈ 0.97) provide moderate value.
