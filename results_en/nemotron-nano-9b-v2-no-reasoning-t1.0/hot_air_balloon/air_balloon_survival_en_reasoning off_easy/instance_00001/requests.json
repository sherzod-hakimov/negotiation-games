            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 4100. The key here is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see which ones are feasible. Let me list out the items and their efforts:\n\nA19: 108\nB91: 133\nA30: 669\nB11: 835\nC47: 460\nC75: 537\nC26: 573\nC73: 737\nA47: 865\nA15: 855\nA75: 596\nA39: 719\nA56: 533\nC24: 549\nB26: 31\n\nAdding these up: Let's see. Let me add them step by step.\n\nStart with A19 (108) + B91 (133) = 241\n+ A30 (669) = 910\n+ B11 (835) = 1745\n+ C47 (460) = 2205\n+ C75 (537) = 2742\n+ C26 (573) = 3315\n+ C73 (737) = 4052\n+ A47 (865) = 4917 → already over 4100. So including A47 would exceed the limit. So need to exclude some items.\n\nSo the total effort of all items is 4917, which is over the limit. So we need to select a subset that sums to <=4100.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate importance per effort ratio? Or just prioritize high importance items with lower effort.\n\nLooking at my importance values:\n\nA19: 138\nB91: 583\nA30: 822\nB11: 783\nC47: 65\nC75: 262\nC26: 121\nC73: 508\nA47: 780\nA15: 461\nA75: 484\nA39: 668\nA56: 389\nC24: 808\nB26: 215\n\nSo the highest importance items are B91 (583), A30 (822), B11 (783), C24 (808), A47 (780), A39 (668), etc. But their efforts vary. For example, B91 has effort 133, which is low, so that's a good candidate. A30 has high importance (822) but effort 669. B11 is 783 with 835 effort. C24 is 808 with 549 effort. So maybe prioritize items with high importance and lower effort.\n\nLet me try to select items in order of importance per effort. Let's calculate importance divided by effort for each item:\n\nA19: 138/108 ≈1.278\nB91: 583/133 ≈4.383\nA30: 822/669 ≈1.228\nB11: 783/835 ≈0.938\nC47: 65/460 ≈0.141\nC75: 262/537 ≈0.488\nC26: 121/573 ≈0.211\nC73: 508/737 ≈0.690\nA47: 780/865 ≈0.902\nA15: 461/855 ≈0.539\nA75: 484/596 ≈0.812\nA39: 668/719 ≈0.929\nA56: 389/533 ≈0.730\nC24: 808/549 ≈1.472\nB26: 215/31 ≈6.935\n\nSo the highest ratios are B26 (6.935), B91 (4.383), C24 (1.472), A19 (1.278), A30 (1.228), A47 (0.902), A39 (0.929), A75 (0.812), A56 (0.730), C73 (0.690), A15 (0.539), C75 (0.488), C26 (0.211), B11 (0.938), C47 (0.141).\n\nWait, B26 has the highest ratio. But B26's importance is 215. So even though the ratio is high, the actual importance is not that high. But since the ratio is high, maybe it's worth including. Let's see.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize total importance. So maybe a combination of high ratio and high absolute importance. For example, B91 has a high ratio and high absolute importance. Similarly, C24 has a high ratio and high importance. A30 is high importance but lower ratio.\n\nSo perhaps start by selecting the highest ratio items first, but also considering their absolute importance.\n\nLet me try to build a set step by step.\n\nStart with B26 (effort 31, importance 215). Total effort so far: 31. Total importance: 215.\n\nNext, B91 (133, 583). Total effort: 31+133=164. Importance: 215+583=798.\n\nNext, C24 (549, 808). Effort: 164+549=713. Importance: 798+808=1606.\n\nNext, A19 (108, 138). Effort: 713+108=821. Importance: 1606+138=1744.\n\nNext, A30 (669, 822). Effort: 821+669=1490. Importance: 1744+822=2566.\n\nNext, A47 (865, 780). Effort: 1490+865=2355. Importance: 2566+780=3346.\n\nNext, A39 (719, 668). Effort: 2355+719=3074. Importance: 3346+668=4014.\n\nNext, A75 (596, 484). Effort: 3074+596=3670. Importance: 4014+484=4498.\n\nNext, A56 (533, 389). Effort: 3670+533=4203. Oh, that's over 4100. So can't include A56. So stop here. Current total effort is 3670, which is under 4100. So maybe add more items.\n\nWait, after A75, the effort is 3670. Let's see what's left. The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), etc. But adding any of these would exceed the limit. For example, adding B11 (835) would make 3670+835=4505>4100. So no. What about C47 (460)? 3670+460=4130>4100. Still over. C75 (537) would be 3670+537=4207>4100. C26 (573) is 3670+573=4243. C73 (737) is 3670+737=4407. A15 (855) is 3670+855=4525. All over. So the current set is B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, A75. Total effort 3670, importance 4498.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe replacing some items. Let's see. Suppose instead of A75 (596 effort, 484 importance), maybe include another item. But I don't see any other items that can fit. Alternatively, maybe exclude A75 and include something else. But A75's importance is 484, which is decent. So maybe this is a good set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check the total effort again. 3670. The limit is 4100. So 4100-3670=430. So can we add any item with effort <=430? Let's check the remaining items:\n\nB11: 835 (too big)\nC47: 460 (too big)\nC75: 537 (too big)\nC26: 573 (too big)\nC73: 737 (too big)\nA15: 855 (too big)\nA56: 533 (too big)\nSo no. So the current set is 3670 effort, 4498 importance.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe instead of A75, include another item. But I don't see any. Alternatively, maybe exclude some items to make room for others. For example, if I remove A75 (596 effort), then I have 3670-596=3074. Then I can add items with effort up to 4100-3074=1026. Let's see. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), A56 (533). So adding B11 (835) would be 3074+835=3909. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3909+460=4369>4100. No. Or add C75 (537) → 3074+537=3611. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3611+460=4071. Then maybe add C26 (573) → 4071+573=4644>4100. So that's 3611+460=4071. Then maybe add B26 (31) → 4071+31=4102>4100. So no. So that would be 3611+460=4071. Then maybe add A56 (533) → 4071+533=4604>4100. No. So that's not better. The importance would be 4498 - 484 (A75) + 835 (B11) + 460 (C47) = 4498 -484=4014 +835=4849 +460=5309. But the effort would be 3074+835+460=3074+1295=4369>4100. So that's over. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace A75 with B11. But B11's effort is 835. So 3670 -596 (A75) +835= 3670-596=3074 +835=3909. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3909+460=4369>4100. No. So that's not better. So the original set seems better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A39 (719 effort) and include other items. Let's see. If I remove A39 (719), then effort is 3670-719=2951. Then I can add items up to 4100-2951=1149. Let's see. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), A56 (533). So adding B11 (835) → 2951+835=3786. Then add C47 (460) → 3786+460=4246>4100. No. Or add C75 (537) → 2951+537=3488. Then add C47 (460) → 3488+460=3948. Then add C26 (573) → 3948+573=4521>4100. No. Or add A15 (855) → 2951+855=3806. Then add C47 (460) → 3806+460=4266>4100. No. So that's not better. The importance would be 4498 -668 (A39) +835 (B11) = 4498-668=3830 +835=4665. But effort is 3786, which is under 4100. But maybe add more. 4100-3786=314. So can add B26 (31) → 3786+31=3817. Importance 4665+215=4880. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3817+460=4277>4100. No. So that's 4880. Which is less than 4498. So not better.\n\nHmm. So the initial set seems better. But maybe there's another combination. Let's think of other high importance items. For example, A30 (822) is a high importance item. What if I include A30 and exclude some others? Let me try a different approach.\n\nStart with high importance items. Let's list items sorted by importance:\n\nA30: 822\nB11: 783\nA47: 780\nC24: 808\nB91: 583\nA39: 668\nC73: 508\nA75: 484\nA15: 461\nA56: 389\nC26: 121\nC75: 262\nC47: 65\nA19: 138\nB26: 215\n\nSo the top items are A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, etc. Let's try to include as many high importance items as possible without exceeding the effort.\n\nStart with A30 (669). Then B11 (835). Total effort: 669+835=1494. Importance: 822+783=1605.\n\nNext, A47 (865). 1494+865=2359. Importance: 1605+780=2385.\n\nNext, C24 (549). 2359+549=2908. Importance: 2385+808=3193.\n\nNext, B91 (133). 2908+133=3041. Importance: 3193+583=3776.\n\nNext, A39 (719). 3041+719=3760. Importance: 3776+668=4444.\n\nNext, A75 (596). 3760+596=4356>4100. Can't add. So stop here. Total effort 3760, importance 4444. That's better than the previous 4498? No, 4444 is less than 4498. So the previous set is better.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add A19 (108). 3041+108=3149. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then add A75 (596) → 3149+596=3745. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then add A56 (533) → 3745+533=4278>4100. No. So that's 4398. Still less than 4498.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add C73 (737). 3041+737=3778. Importance 3776+508=4284. Then add A75 (596) → 3778+596=4374>4100. No. So 4284. Still less than 4498.\n\nSo the initial set of B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, A75 gives 4498 importance with 3670 effort. That seems good. But maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial set includes B26 (31), B91 (133), C24 (549), A19 (108), A30 (669), A47 (865), A39 (719), A75 (596). Let's sum the effort:\n\n31 +133 = 164\n+549 = 713\n+108 = 821\n+669 = 1490\n+865 = 2355\n+719 = 3074\n+596 = 3670. Correct.\n\nSo total effort 3670. Now, can I add any other items? Let's see. The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), A56 (533). All of these have effort over 430 (since 4100-3670=430). So no. So that's the maximum.\n\nBut maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I exclude A75 (596) and include B11 (835). Let's see. The effort would be 3670 -596 +835 = 3670-596=3074 +835=3909. Then importance would be 4498 -484 +783 = 4498-484=4014 +783=4797. That's better. But effort is 3909, which is under 4100. Then maybe add more items. 4100-3909=191. So can add B26 (31) → 3909+31=3940. Importance 4797+215=5012. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3940+460=4400. Importance 5012+65=5077. Then add C75 (537) → 4400+537=4937>4100. No. So that's 5077. That's better than 4498. So this is a better set.\n\nSo the set would be B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, B11, C47. Let's check the effort:\n\n31 (B26) +133 (B91) = 164\n+549 (C24) = 713\n+108 (A19) = 821\n+669 (A30) = 1490\n+865 (A47) = 2355\n+835 (B11) = 3190\n+460 (C47) = 3650. Wait, 2355+835=3190, then +460=3650. That's under 4100. So total effort 3650. Importance: 215 (B26) +583 (B91) +808 (C24) +138 (A19) +822 (A30) +780 (A47) +783 (B11) +65 (C47) = let's calculate:\n\n215 +583 = 798\n+808 = 1606\n+138 = 1744\n+822 = 2566\n+780 = 3346\n+783 = 4129\n+65 = 4194. So total importance 4194. That's better than 4498? No, 4194 is less than 4498. Wait, no. Wait, in this scenario, I excluded A75 (484) and included B11 (783) and C47 (65). So the total importance is 4194, which is less than 4498. So that's worse. So the initial set is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A75 and include B11 and C47. But the importance is lower. So that's not better.\n\nAnother approach: maybe include A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, and then some others. Let's see. Let's try to maximize the importance.\n\nA30 (822) + B11 (783) + A47 (780) + C24 (808) + B91 (583) = 822+783=1605+780=2385+808=3193+583=3776. Effort: 669+835=1494+865=2359+549=2908+133=3041. Then, remaining effort: 4100-3041=1059. What can we add? Let's see. A19 (108) → 3041+108=3149. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then A75 (596) → 3149+596=3745. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then A56 (533) → 3745+533=4278>4100. No. So that's 4398. Still less than 4498.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add A39 (719). 3041+719=3760. Importance 3776+668=4444. Then add A75 (596) → 3760+596=4356>4100. No. So 4444. Still less than 4498.\n\nSo the initial set of 4498 seems better. But maybe there's another combination. Let's think of including C24 (808) which is high importance and moderate effort. Then B91 (583) with low effort. A30 (822) with high effort. A47 (780) with high effort. A39 (668) with high effort. A75 (484) with moderate effort. B26 (215) with very low effort. That seems like a good mix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace A75 with another item. For example, if I remove A75 (596) and add C73 (737). But 3670-596=3074 +737=3811. Then importance would be 4498-484+508=4498-484=4014+508=4522. That's better. So 4522. Effort 3811. Then can we add more? 4100-3811=289. So can add B26 (31) → 3811+31=3842. Importance 4522+215=4737. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3842+460=4302. Importance 4737+65=4802. Then add C75 (537) → 4302+537=4839>4100. No. So that's 4802. Which is better than 4498. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, C73. Let's check the effort:\n\n31 (B26) +133 (B91) = 164\n+549 (C24) = 713\n+108 (A19) = 821\n+669 (A30) = 1490\n+865 (A47) = 2355\n+719 (A39) = 3074\n+737 (C73) = 3811. Total effort 3811. Importance: 215+583+808+138+822+780+668+508 = let's calculate:\n\n215+583=798\n+808=1606\n+138=1744\n+822=2566\n+780=3346\n+668=4014\n+508=4522. Yes. So 4522. That's better than 4498. So this is a better set.\n\nBut can we add more? 4100-3811=289. So maybe add A15 (855) is too big. C47 (460) is 460>289. No. C75 (537) is too big. A56 (533) is too big. So no. So this set is 3811 effort, 4522 importance. That's better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace A75 with C73 and add B26. But that's what we did. So this seems better.\n\nAnother possibility: instead of A39 (719), maybe include another item. But I don't see a better option. So this set seems good.\n\nBut wait, what if we exclude A39 and include something else? Let's see. If we remove A39 (719), effort becomes 3811-719=3092. Then we can add items up to 4100-3092=1008. Let's see. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), A15 (855), A56 (533). So adding B11 (835) would be 3092+835=3927. Importance 4522-668=3854 +783=4637. Then add C47 (460) → 3927+460=4387. Importance 4637+65=4702. Then add C75 (537) → 4387+537=4924>4100. No. So that's 4702. Which is better than 4522. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, B11, C47. Let's check the effort:\n\n31+133=164 +549=713 +108=821 +669=1490 +865=2355 +835=3190 +460=3650. Total effort 3650. Importance: 215+583+808+138+822+780+783+65= let's calculate:\n\n215+583=798\n+808=1606\n+138=1744\n+822=2566\n+780=3346\n+783=4129\n+65=4194. So 4194. Which is less than 4522. So that's worse. So the previous set with C73 is better.\n\nSo the best so far is 4522 with effort 3811. Can we add more? Let's see. 4100-3811=289. Any items with effort <=289? Let's check:\n\nB26 is already included. B91 is included. C24 is included. A19 is included. A30 is included. A47 is included. A39 is included. C73 is included. The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), A15 (855), A56 (533). All of these have effort over 289. So no. So that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, if we remove A39 (719) and add B11 (835) and C47 (460). Let's see. The effort would be 3811 -719 +835 +460 = 3811-719=3092 +835=3927 +460=4387. Which is over 4100. So no. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, remove A39 and add B11 and C47. But that would be 3811-719=3092 +835+460=3092+1295=4387>4100. No.\n\nSo the best set so far is 4522 importance with 3811 effort. But maybe there's another combination. Let's think of including A56 (389) instead of something else. For example, if we remove A75 (596) and add A56 (533). But 3811-596=3215 +533=3748. Importance 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So not better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe include C75 (537) instead of A75. But 3811-596=3215 +537=3752. Importance 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Which is worse.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522 importance with 3811 effort. But maybe there's a better combination. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhat if I prioritize items with the highest importance first, regardless of effort? Let's try that.\n\nTop items by importance:\n\nA30 (822), B11 (783), A47 (780), C24 (808), B91 (583), A39 (668), C73 (508), A75 (484), A15 (461), A56 (389), C26 (121), B26 (215), C47 (65), A19 (138).\n\nSo start with A30 (669). Then B11 (835). Total effort 669+835=1494. Importance 822+783=1605.\n\nNext, A47 (865). 1494+865=2359. Importance 1605+780=2385.\n\nNext, C24 (549). 2359+549=2908. Importance 2385+808=3193.\n\nNext, B91 (133). 2908+133=3041. Importance 3193+583=3776.\n\nNext, A39 (719). 3041+719=3760. Importance 3776+668=4444.\n\nNext, A75 (596). 3760+596=4356>4100. Can't add. So stop here. Total effort 3760, importance 4444. Which is less than 4522. So the previous set is better.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add A19 (108). 3041+108=3149. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then add A75 (596) → 3149+596=3745. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then add A56 (533) → 3745+533=4278>4100. No. So 4398. Still less than 4522.\n\nSo the set with C73 seems better. Let me check if there's a way to include more high importance items. For example, A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, A39, C73, and maybe A15 or others. But the effort would be too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A39 and include A56. Let's see. If we remove A39 (719) and add A56 (533). Effort: 3811-719+533=3811-719=3092+533=3625. Importance: 4522-668+389=4522-668=3854+389=4243. Which is worse than 4522. So no.\n\nAnother idea: maybe include C75 (537) instead of A75. But that would be 3811-596+537=3811-596=3215+537=3752. Importance 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Which is worse.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522 importance with 3811 effort. But maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check the effort again. 3811. 4100-3811=289. Are there any items with effort <=289? Let's see:\n\nB26 is already included (31). B91 (133), C24 (549), A19 (108), A30 (669), A47 (865), A39 (719), C73 (737). The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), A15 (855), A56 (533). All of these have effort over 289. So no. So that's the maximum.\n\nBut wait, what about C75 (537)? 537 is over 289. So no. So no more items can be added. So this set is 3811 effort, 4522 importance.\n\nBut maybe there's another combination. Let's think of including C75 (537) and exclude some other items. For example, if I remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Which is worse than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A75 (596) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-596+537=3811-596=3215+537=3752. Importance: 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Still worse.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a different combination. Let me try another approach. Let's try to include as many high importance items as possible, even if their effort is higher, but within the limit.\n\nFor example, A30 (822) is a high importance item. Let's include that. Then B11 (783), A47 (780), C24 (808), B91 (583). That's 822+783+780+808+583= let's calculate: 822+783=1605+780=2385+808=3193+583=3776. Effort: 669+835+865+549+133= 669+835=1504+865=2369+549=2918+133=3051. Then, remaining effort: 4100-3051=1049. What can we add? A19 (108), A75 (596), A39 (719), A56 (533), C73 (737), C47 (460), C26 (573), B26 (31). Let's try adding A19 (108): 3051+108=3159. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then A75 (596): 3159+596=3755. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then A56 (533): 3755+533=4288. Importance 4398+389=4787. Then C73 (737): 4288+737=5025>4100. No. So that's 4787. Which is better than 4522. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, A19, A75, A56. Let's check the effort:\n\n669 (A30) +835 (B11) = 1494\n+865 (A47) = 2359\n+549 (C24) = 2908\n+133 (B91) = 3041\n+108 (A19) = 3149\n+596 (A75) = 3745\n+533 (A56) = 4278. Wait, 3745+533=4278. Which is over 4100. Oh no! So that's a problem. So I can't add A56. So after A75, the effort is 3745. Then adding A56 (533) would make 3745+533=4278>4100. So that's over. So I can't add A56. So the set would be up to A75: 3745 effort, 4398 importance. Then maybe add C73 (737) → 3745+737=4482>4100. No. So that's not possible. So the maximum here is 4398. Which is less than 4522. So the previous set is better.\n\nSo the set with C73 is better. So 4522 is better than 4398.\n\nAnother idea: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A75. Let's see. If I remove A75 (596) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-596+537=3811-596=3215+537=3752. Importance: 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Which is worse than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Still worse.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check again. The current set is B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, C73. Effort 3811. What if I remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537) and B11 (835)? Wait, but B11 is already included. Wait, no. Let me think. If I remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537) and B11 (835). But B11 is already in the set. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe remove A39 and add C75 and B11. But B11 is already in the set. So that's not possible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove A39 and add C75 and B26 (but B26 is already in). No. So no.\n\nAnother thought: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A39. Let's see. Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Which is worse. So no.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522. But maybe there's a different combination. Let me try to include A56 (533) instead of something else. For example, if I remove A75 (596) and add A56 (533). Effort: 3811-596+533=3811-596=3215+533=3748. Importance: 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A75 and add C75 and A56. But that would be 3811-596+537+533=3811-596=3215+537=3752+533=4285. Which is over 4100. So no.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. Let me try another combination.\n\nWhat if I include A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, C73, and B26. That's the same as before. What if I add A15 (461) instead of something else? Let's see. If I remove A39 (719) and add A15 (855). Effort: 3811-719+855=3811-719=3092+855=3947. Importance: 4522-668+461=4522-668=3854+461=4315. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A39 and add A15 and C75. Effort: 3811-719+855+537=3811-719=3092+855=3947+537=4484. Which is over 4100. So no.\n\nSo no improvement there.\n\nAnother approach: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A75. But as before, that's worse.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522. But I need to make sure that this set is valid. Let me check the effort again:\n\nB26:31, B91:133, C24:549, A19:108, A30:669, A47:865, A39:719, C73:737.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n31 +133 = 164\n\n+549 = 713\n\n+108 = 821\n\n+669 = 1490\n\n+865 = 2355\n\n+719 = 3074\n\n+737 = 3811. Correct. Total effort 3811 ≤4100. So that's valid.\n\nNow, the importance is 215+583+808+138+822+780+668+508. Let me add them step by step:\n\n215 +583 = 798\n\n+808 = 1606\n\n+138 = 1744\n\n+822 = 2566\n\n+780 = 3346\n\n+668 = 4014\n\n+508 = 4522. Correct.\n\nSo this set is valid and gives 4522 importance. Is there a way to get higher?\n\nWhat if I include A56 (533) instead of A75 (596)? Let's see. Effort: 3811-596+533=3811-596=3215+533=3748. Importance: 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include A56 and exclude A75. But that's worse.\n\nAnother idea: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A39. Let's see. Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Still worse.\n\nSo no. So the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a different combination. Let me think of including C75 and B11. For example, if I have A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, C75. Let's calculate effort:\n\n669+835=1494+865=2359+549=2908+133=3041+537=3578. Importance: 822+783+780+808+583+262= let's calculate:\n\n822+783=1605+780=2385+808=3193+583=3776+262=4038. Then, can we add more? 4100-3578=522. So can add A19 (108) → 3578+108=3686. Importance 4038+138=4176. Then add A75 (596) → 3686+596=4282>4100. No. So that's 4176. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, after 3578, add A19 (108) and A75 (596). 3578+108+596=3578+704=4282>4100. No. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, including C75 and B11. But I don't see a way without exceeding the limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A47 (865) and include other items. Let's see. If I remove A47 (865), effort becomes 3811-865=2946. Then I can add items up to 4100-2946=1154. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), A15 (855), A56 (533), A39 (719), etc. So adding B11 (835) → 2946+835=3781. Importance 4522-780+783=4522-780=3742+783=4525. Then add C47 (460) → 3781+460=4241. Importance 4525+65=4590. Then add C75 (537) → 4241+537=4778>4100. No. So that's 4590. Which is better than 4522. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be A30, B11, C24, B91, C75, A19. Let's check the effort:\n\nA30 (669) + B11 (835) = 1494\n\n+ C24 (549) = 2908\n\n+ B91 (133) = 3041\n\n+ C75 (537) = 3578\n\n+ A19 (108) = 3686. Total effort 3686. Importance: 822+783+808+583+262+138= let's calculate:\n\n822+783=1605+808=2413+583=3000+262=3262+138=3399. Wait, that's not right. Wait, the items are A30 (822), B11 (783), C24 (808), B91 (583), C75 (262), A19 (138). So total importance is 822+783+808+583+262+138. Let's add:\n\n822+783=1605\n\n+808=2413\n\n+583=2996\n\n+262=3258\n\n+138=3396. So 3396. Which is less than 4522. So that's worse. So that's not better.\n\nBut earlier calculation said 4590. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. If I remove A47 (780) and add C75 (262) and B11 (783). Wait, B11 is already in the set. So the initial set without A47 would be A30, B11, C24, B91, C75, A19. Effort: 669+835+549+133+537+108= let's calculate:\n\n669+835=1494\n\n+549=2043\n\n+133=2176\n\n+537=2713\n\n+108=2821. Total effort 2821. Importance: 822+783+808+583+262+138= 822+783=1605+808=2413+583=2996+262=3258+138=3396. So 3396. Which is less than 4522. So that's worse. So my previous calculation was wrong. So that's not better.\n\nSo the initial set of 4522 is better. So I think that's the best I can do. But maybe there's another combination. Let me try including A56 (533) and exclude A75. So effort would be 3811-596+533=3811-596=3215+533=3748. Importance: 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include A56 and exclude A39. Effort: 3811-719+533=3811-719=3092+533=3625. Importance: 4522-668+389=4522-668=3854+389=4243. Still less than 4522.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. Now, I need to propose this set. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 4100. Which it is (3811). So the proposal would be the set {B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, C73}.\n\nBut I should also consider that the other participant might have different importance values. Since I don't know theirs, I have to assume that they might value different items. But since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on that.\n\nNow, the next step is to make a proposal. The user's instruction says to use the PROPOSAL format. So I should propose this set. But I need to make sure that the set is valid (effort <=4100). Which it is. So the proposal would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B26', 'B91', 'C24', 'A19', 'A30', 'A47', 'A39', 'C73'}\n\nBut I should also include an ARGUMENT to defend this proposal. The argument should explain why this set is good. For example, it includes high importance items with reasonable effort, maximizing the total importance while staying under the limit.\n\nSo the message would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B26', 'B91', 'C24', 'A19', 'A30', 'A47', 'A39', 'C73'}\nARGUMENT: This proposal includes high importance items like A30 (822), B11 (783), and C24 (808) while keeping the total effort at 3811, which is well under the limit. It balances high-value items with manageable effort to maximize my total importance.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is included. Also, the user said to include the ARGUMENT format at least once. So this message includes both PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to negotiate, so maybe first propose a set, then argue. But according to the interaction protocol, the first message can be a proposal with an argument.\n\nSo the first message would be the proposal and the argument. Then the other participant would respond with a proposal or refusal. But since I'm the one starting, I should make the first proposal.\n\nSo the final answer is the proposal and the argument as above.\n",

                "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 4100. The key here is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see which ones are feasible. Let me list out the items and their efforts:\n\nA19: 108\nB91: 133\nA30: 669\nB11: 835\nC47: 460\nC75: 537\nC26: 573\nC73: 737\nA47: 865\nA15: 855\nA75: 596\nA39: 719\nA56: 533\nC24: 549\nB26: 31\n\nAdding these up: Let's see. Let me add them step by step.\n\nStart with A19 (108) + B91 (133) = 241\n+ A30 (669) = 910\n+ B11 (835) = 1745\n+ C47 (460) = 2205\n+ C75 (537) = 2742\n+ C26 (573) = 3315\n+ C73 (737) = 4052\n+ A47 (865) = 4917 → already over 4100. So including A47 would exceed the limit. So need to exclude some items.\n\nSo the total effort of all items is 4917, which is over the limit. So we need to select a subset that sums to <=4100.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate importance per effort ratio? Or just prioritize high importance items with lower effort.\n\nLooking at my importance values:\n\nA19: 138\nB91: 583\nA30: 822\nB11: 783\nC47: 65\nC75: 262\nC26: 121\nC73: 508\nA47: 780\nA15: 461\nA75: 484\nA39: 668\nA56: 389\nC24: 808\nB26: 215\n\nSo the highest importance items are B91 (583), A30 (822), B11 (783), C24 (808), A47 (780), A39 (668), etc. But their efforts vary. For example, B91 has effort 133, which is low, so that's a good candidate. A30 has high importance (822) but effort 669. B11 is 783 with 835 effort. C24 is 808 with 549 effort. So maybe prioritize items with high importance and lower effort.\n\nLet me try to select items in order of importance per effort. Let's calculate importance divided by effort for each item:\n\nA19: 138/108 ≈1.278\nB91: 583/133 ≈4.383\nA30: 822/669 ≈1.228\nB11: 783/835 ≈0.938\nC47: 65/460 ≈0.141\nC75: 262/537 ≈0.488\nC26: 121/573 ≈0.211\nC73: 508/737 ≈0.690\nA47: 780/865 ≈0.902\nA15: 461/855 ≈0.539\nA75: 484/596 ≈0.812\nA39: 668/719 ≈0.929\nA56: 389/533 ≈0.730\nC24: 808/549 ≈1.472\nB26: 215/31 ≈6.935\n\nSo the highest ratios are B26 (6.935), B91 (4.383), C24 (1.472), A19 (1.278), A30 (1.228), A47 (0.902), A39 (0.929), A75 (0.812), A56 (0.730), C73 (0.690), A15 (0.539), C75 (0.488), C26 (0.211), B11 (0.938), C47 (0.141).\n\nWait, B26 has the highest ratio. But B26's importance is 215. So even though the ratio is high, the actual importance is not that high. But since the ratio is high, maybe it's worth including. Let's see.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize total importance. So maybe a combination of high ratio and high absolute importance. For example, B91 has a high ratio and high absolute importance. Similarly, C24 has a high ratio and high importance. A30 is high importance but lower ratio.\n\nSo perhaps start by selecting the highest ratio items first, but also considering their absolute importance.\n\nLet me try to build a set step by step.\n\nStart with B26 (effort 31, importance 215). Total effort so far: 31. Total importance: 215.\n\nNext, B91 (133, 583). Total effort: 31+133=164. Importance: 215+583=798.\n\nNext, C24 (549, 808). Effort: 164+549=713. Importance: 798+808=1606.\n\nNext, A19 (108, 138). Effort: 713+108=821. Importance: 1606+138=1744.\n\nNext, A30 (669, 822). Effort: 821+669=1490. Importance: 1744+822=2566.\n\nNext, A47 (865, 780). Effort: 1490+865=2355. Importance: 2566+780=3346.\n\nNext, A39 (719, 668). Effort: 2355+719=3074. Importance: 3346+668=4014.\n\nNext, A75 (596, 484). Effort: 3074+596=3670. Importance: 4014+484=4498.\n\nNext, A56 (533, 389). Effort: 3670+533=4203. Oh, that's over 4100. So can't include A56. So stop here. Current total effort is 3670, which is under 4100. So maybe add more items.\n\nWait, after A75, the effort is 3670. Let's see what's left. The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), etc. But adding any of these would exceed the limit. For example, adding B11 (835) would make 3670+835=4505>4100. So no. What about C47 (460)? 3670+460=4130>4100. Still over. C75 (537) would be 3670+537=4207>4100. C26 (573) is 3670+573=4243. C73 (737) is 3670+737=4407. A15 (855) is 3670+855=4525. All over. So the current set is B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, A75. Total effort 3670, importance 4498.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe replacing some items. Let's see. Suppose instead of A75 (596 effort, 484 importance), maybe include another item. But I don't see any other items that can fit. Alternatively, maybe exclude A75 and include something else. But A75's importance is 484, which is decent. So maybe this is a good set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check the total effort again. 3670. The limit is 4100. So 4100-3670=430. So can we add any item with effort <=430? Let's check the remaining items:\n\nB11: 835 (too big)\nC47: 460 (too big)\nC75: 537 (too big)\nC26: 573 (too big)\nC73: 737 (too big)\nA15: 855 (too big)\nA56: 533 (too big)\nSo no. So the current set is 3670 effort, 4498 importance.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, maybe instead of A75, include another item. But I don't see any. Alternatively, maybe exclude some items to make room for others. For example, if I remove A75 (596 effort), then I have 3670-596=3074. Then I can add items with effort up to 4100-3074=1026. Let's see. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), A56 (533). So adding B11 (835) would be 3074+835=3909. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3909+460=4369>4100. No. Or add C75 (537) → 3074+537=3611. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3611+460=4071. Then maybe add C26 (573) → 4071+573=4644>4100. So that's 3611+460=4071. Then maybe add B26 (31) → 4071+31=4102>4100. So no. So that would be 3611+460=4071. Then maybe add A56 (533) → 4071+533=4604>4100. No. So that's not better. The importance would be 4498 - 484 (A75) + 835 (B11) + 460 (C47) = 4498 -484=4014 +835=4849 +460=5309. But the effort would be 3074+835+460=3074+1295=4369>4100. So that's over. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace A75 with B11. But B11's effort is 835. So 3670 -596 (A75) +835= 3670-596=3074 +835=3909. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3909+460=4369>4100. No. So that's not better. So the original set seems better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A39 (719 effort) and include other items. Let's see. If I remove A39 (719), then effort is 3670-719=2951. Then I can add items up to 4100-2951=1149. Let's see. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), A56 (533). So adding B11 (835) → 2951+835=3786. Then add C47 (460) → 3786+460=4246>4100. No. Or add C75 (537) → 2951+537=3488. Then add C47 (460) → 3488+460=3948. Then add C26 (573) → 3948+573=4521>4100. No. Or add A15 (855) → 2951+855=3806. Then add C47 (460) → 3806+460=4266>4100. No. So that's not better. The importance would be 4498 -668 (A39) +835 (B11) = 4498-668=3830 +835=4665. But effort is 3786, which is under 4100. But maybe add more. 4100-3786=314. So can add B26 (31) → 3786+31=3817. Importance 4665+215=4880. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3817+460=4277>4100. No. So that's 4880. Which is less than 4498. So not better.\n\nHmm. So the initial set seems better. But maybe there's another combination. Let's think of other high importance items. For example, A30 (822) is a high importance item. What if I include A30 and exclude some others? Let me try a different approach.\n\nStart with high importance items. Let's list items sorted by importance:\n\nA30: 822\nB11: 783\nA47: 780\nC24: 808\nB91: 583\nA39: 668\nC73: 508\nA75: 484\nA15: 461\nA56: 389\nC26: 121\nC75: 262\nC47: 65\nA19: 138\nB26: 215\n\nSo the top items are A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, etc. Let's try to include as many high importance items as possible without exceeding the effort.\n\nStart with A30 (669). Then B11 (835). Total effort: 669+835=1494. Importance: 822+783=1605.\n\nNext, A47 (865). 1494+865=2359. Importance: 1605+780=2385.\n\nNext, C24 (549). 2359+549=2908. Importance: 2385+808=3193.\n\nNext, B91 (133). 2908+133=3041. Importance: 3193+583=3776.\n\nNext, A39 (719). 3041+719=3760. Importance: 3776+668=4444.\n\nNext, A75 (596). 3760+596=4356>4100. Can't add. So stop here. Total effort 3760, importance 4444. That's better than the previous 4498? No, 4444 is less than 4498. So the previous set is better.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add A19 (108). 3041+108=3149. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then add A75 (596) → 3149+596=3745. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then add A56 (533) → 3745+533=4278>4100. No. So that's 4398. Still less than 4498.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add C73 (737). 3041+737=3778. Importance 3776+508=4284. Then add A75 (596) → 3778+596=4374>4100. No. So 4284. Still less than 4498.\n\nSo the initial set of B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, A75 gives 4498 importance with 3670 effort. That seems good. But maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial set includes B26 (31), B91 (133), C24 (549), A19 (108), A30 (669), A47 (865), A39 (719), A75 (596). Let's sum the effort:\n\n31 +133 = 164\n+549 = 713\n+108 = 821\n+669 = 1490\n+865 = 2355\n+719 = 3074\n+596 = 3670. Correct.\n\nSo total effort 3670. Now, can I add any other items? Let's see. The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), C73 (737), A15 (855), A56 (533). All of these have effort over 430 (since 4100-3670=430). So no. So that's the maximum.\n\nBut maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I exclude A75 (596) and include B11 (835). Let's see. The effort would be 3670 -596 +835 = 3670-596=3074 +835=3909. Then importance would be 4498 -484 +783 = 4498-484=4014 +783=4797. That's better. But effort is 3909, which is under 4100. Then maybe add more items. 4100-3909=191. So can add B26 (31) → 3909+31=3940. Importance 4797+215=5012. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3940+460=4400. Importance 5012+65=5077. Then add C75 (537) → 4400+537=4937>4100. No. So that's 5077. That's better than 4498. So this is a better set.\n\nSo the set would be B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, B11, C47. Let's check the effort:\n\n31 (B26) +133 (B91) = 164\n+549 (C24) = 713\n+108 (A19) = 821\n+669 (A30) = 1490\n+865 (A47) = 2355\n+835 (B11) = 3190\n+460 (C47) = 3650. Wait, 2355+835=3190, then +460=3650. That's under 4100. So total effort 3650. Importance: 215 (B26) +583 (B91) +808 (C24) +138 (A19) +822 (A30) +780 (A47) +783 (B11) +65 (C47) = let's calculate:\n\n215 +583 = 798\n+808 = 1606\n+138 = 1744\n+822 = 2566\n+780 = 3346\n+783 = 4129\n+65 = 4194. So total importance 4194. That's better than 4498? No, 4194 is less than 4498. Wait, no. Wait, in this scenario, I excluded A75 (484) and included B11 (783) and C47 (65). So the total importance is 4194, which is less than 4498. So that's worse. So the initial set is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A75 and include B11 and C47. But the importance is lower. So that's not better.\n\nAnother approach: maybe include A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, and then some others. Let's see. Let's try to maximize the importance.\n\nA30 (822) + B11 (783) + A47 (780) + C24 (808) + B91 (583) = 822+783=1605+780=2385+808=3193+583=3776. Effort: 669+835=1494+865=2359+549=2908+133=3041. Then, remaining effort: 4100-3041=1059. What can we add? Let's see. A19 (108) → 3041+108=3149. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then A75 (596) → 3149+596=3745. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then A56 (533) → 3745+533=4278>4100. No. So that's 4398. Still less than 4498.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add A39 (719). 3041+719=3760. Importance 3776+668=4444. Then add A75 (596) → 3760+596=4356>4100. No. So 4444. Still less than 4498.\n\nSo the initial set of 4498 seems better. But maybe there's another combination. Let's think of including C24 (808) which is high importance and moderate effort. Then B91 (583) with low effort. A30 (822) with high effort. A47 (780) with high effort. A39 (668) with high effort. A75 (484) with moderate effort. B26 (215) with very low effort. That seems like a good mix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace A75 with another item. For example, if I remove A75 (596) and add C73 (737). But 3670-596=3074 +737=3811. Then importance would be 4498-484+508=4498-484=4014+508=4522. That's better. So 4522. Effort 3811. Then can we add more? 4100-3811=289. So can add B26 (31) → 3811+31=3842. Importance 4522+215=4737. Then maybe add C47 (460) → 3842+460=4302. Importance 4737+65=4802. Then add C75 (537) → 4302+537=4839>4100. No. So that's 4802. Which is better than 4498. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, C73. Let's check the effort:\n\n31 (B26) +133 (B91) = 164\n+549 (C24) = 713\n+108 (A19) = 821\n+669 (A30) = 1490\n+865 (A47) = 2355\n+719 (A39) = 3074\n+737 (C73) = 3811. Total effort 3811. Importance: 215+583+808+138+822+780+668+508 = let's calculate:\n\n215+583=798\n+808=1606\n+138=1744\n+822=2566\n+780=3346\n+668=4014\n+508=4522. Yes. So 4522. That's better than 4498. So this is a better set.\n\nBut can we add more? 4100-3811=289. So maybe add A15 (855) is too big. C47 (460) is 460>289. No. C75 (537) is too big. A56 (533) is too big. So no. So this set is 3811 effort, 4522 importance. That's better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace A75 with C73 and add B26. But that's what we did. So this seems better.\n\nAnother possibility: instead of A39 (719), maybe include another item. But I don't see a better option. So this set seems good.\n\nBut wait, what if we exclude A39 and include something else? Let's see. If we remove A39 (719), effort becomes 3811-719=3092. Then we can add items up to 4100-3092=1008. Let's see. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), A15 (855), A56 (533). So adding B11 (835) would be 3092+835=3927. Importance 4522-668=3854 +783=4637. Then add C47 (460) → 3927+460=4387. Importance 4637+65=4702. Then add C75 (537) → 4387+537=4924>4100. No. So that's 4702. Which is better than 4522. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, B11, C47. Let's check the effort:\n\n31+133=164 +549=713 +108=821 +669=1490 +865=2355 +835=3190 +460=3650. Total effort 3650. Importance: 215+583+808+138+822+780+783+65= let's calculate:\n\n215+583=798\n+808=1606\n+138=1744\n+822=2566\n+780=3346\n+783=4129\n+65=4194. So 4194. Which is less than 4522. So that's worse. So the previous set with C73 is better.\n\nSo the best so far is 4522 with effort 3811. Can we add more? Let's see. 4100-3811=289. Any items with effort <=289? Let's check:\n\nB26 is already included. B91 is included. C24 is included. A19 is included. A30 is included. A47 is included. A39 is included. C73 is included. The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), A15 (855), A56 (533). All of these have effort over 289. So no. So that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, if we remove A39 (719) and add B11 (835) and C47 (460). Let's see. The effort would be 3811 -719 +835 +460 = 3811-719=3092 +835=3927 +460=4387. Which is over 4100. So no. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, remove A39 and add B11 and C47. But that would be 3811-719=3092 +835+460=3092+1295=4387>4100. No.\n\nSo the best set so far is 4522 importance with 3811 effort. But maybe there's another combination. Let's think of including A56 (389) instead of something else. For example, if we remove A75 (596) and add A56 (533). But 3811-596=3215 +533=3748. Importance 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So not better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe include C75 (537) instead of A75. But 3811-596=3215 +537=3752. Importance 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Which is worse.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522 importance with 3811 effort. But maybe there's a better combination. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhat if I prioritize items with the highest importance first, regardless of effort? Let's try that.\n\nTop items by importance:\n\nA30 (822), B11 (783), A47 (780), C24 (808), B91 (583), A39 (668), C73 (508), A75 (484), A15 (461), A56 (389), C26 (121), B26 (215), C47 (65), A19 (138).\n\nSo start with A30 (669). Then B11 (835). Total effort 669+835=1494. Importance 822+783=1605.\n\nNext, A47 (865). 1494+865=2359. Importance 1605+780=2385.\n\nNext, C24 (549). 2359+549=2908. Importance 2385+808=3193.\n\nNext, B91 (133). 2908+133=3041. Importance 3193+583=3776.\n\nNext, A39 (719). 3041+719=3760. Importance 3776+668=4444.\n\nNext, A75 (596). 3760+596=4356>4100. Can't add. So stop here. Total effort 3760, importance 4444. Which is less than 4522. So the previous set is better.\n\nAlternatively, after A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, maybe add A19 (108). 3041+108=3149. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then add A75 (596) → 3149+596=3745. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then add A56 (533) → 3745+533=4278>4100. No. So 4398. Still less than 4522.\n\nSo the set with C73 seems better. Let me check if there's a way to include more high importance items. For example, A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, A39, C73, and maybe A15 or others. But the effort would be too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A39 and include A56. Let's see. If we remove A39 (719) and add A56 (533). Effort: 3811-719+533=3811-719=3092+533=3625. Importance: 4522-668+389=4522-668=3854+389=4243. Which is worse than 4522. So no.\n\nAnother idea: maybe include C75 (537) instead of A75. But that would be 3811-596+537=3811-596=3215+537=3752. Importance 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Which is worse.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522 importance with 3811 effort. But maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check the effort again. 3811. 4100-3811=289. Are there any items with effort <=289? Let's see:\n\nB26 is already included (31). B91 (133), C24 (549), A19 (108), A30 (669), A47 (865), A39 (719), C73 (737). The remaining items are B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), A15 (855), A56 (533). All of these have effort over 289. So no. So that's the maximum.\n\nBut wait, what about C75 (537)? 537 is over 289. So no. So no more items can be added. So this set is 3811 effort, 4522 importance.\n\nBut maybe there's another combination. Let's think of including C75 (537) and exclude some other items. For example, if I remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Which is worse than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A75 (596) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-596+537=3811-596=3215+537=3752. Importance: 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Still worse.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a different combination. Let me try another approach. Let's try to include as many high importance items as possible, even if their effort is higher, but within the limit.\n\nFor example, A30 (822) is a high importance item. Let's include that. Then B11 (783), A47 (780), C24 (808), B91 (583). That's 822+783+780+808+583= let's calculate: 822+783=1605+780=2385+808=3193+583=3776. Effort: 669+835+865+549+133= 669+835=1504+865=2369+549=2918+133=3051. Then, remaining effort: 4100-3051=1049. What can we add? A19 (108), A75 (596), A39 (719), A56 (533), C73 (737), C47 (460), C26 (573), B26 (31). Let's try adding A19 (108): 3051+108=3159. Importance 3776+138=3914. Then A75 (596): 3159+596=3755. Importance 3914+484=4398. Then A56 (533): 3755+533=4288. Importance 4398+389=4787. Then C73 (737): 4288+737=5025>4100. No. So that's 4787. Which is better than 4522. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, A19, A75, A56. Let's check the effort:\n\n669 (A30) +835 (B11) = 1494\n+865 (A47) = 2359\n+549 (C24) = 2908\n+133 (B91) = 3041\n+108 (A19) = 3149\n+596 (A75) = 3745\n+533 (A56) = 4278. Wait, 3745+533=4278. Which is over 4100. Oh no! So that's a problem. So I can't add A56. So after A75, the effort is 3745. Then adding A56 (533) would make 3745+533=4278>4100. So that's over. So I can't add A56. So the set would be up to A75: 3745 effort, 4398 importance. Then maybe add C73 (737) → 3745+737=4482>4100. No. So that's not possible. So the maximum here is 4398. Which is less than 4522. So the previous set is better.\n\nSo the set with C73 is better. So 4522 is better than 4398.\n\nAnother idea: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A75. Let's see. If I remove A75 (596) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-596+537=3811-596=3215+537=3752. Importance: 4522-484+262=4522-484=4038+262=4300. Which is worse than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537). Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Still worse.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a way to include more items. Let me check again. The current set is B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, C73. Effort 3811. What if I remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537) and B11 (835)? Wait, but B11 is already included. Wait, no. Let me think. If I remove A39 (719) and add C75 (537) and B11 (835). But B11 is already in the set. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe remove A39 and add C75 and B11. But B11 is already in the set. So that's not possible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove A39 and add C75 and B26 (but B26 is already in). No. So no.\n\nAnother thought: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A39. Let's see. Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Which is worse. So no.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522. But maybe there's a different combination. Let me try to include A56 (533) instead of something else. For example, if I remove A75 (596) and add A56 (533). Effort: 3811-596+533=3811-596=3215+533=3748. Importance: 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A75 and add C75 and A56. But that would be 3811-596+537+533=3811-596=3215+537=3752+533=4285. Which is over 4100. So no.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. Let me try another combination.\n\nWhat if I include A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, C73, and B26. That's the same as before. What if I add A15 (461) instead of something else? Let's see. If I remove A39 (719) and add A15 (855). Effort: 3811-719+855=3811-719=3092+855=3947. Importance: 4522-668+461=4522-668=3854+461=4315. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, remove A39 and add A15 and C75. Effort: 3811-719+855+537=3811-719=3092+855=3947+537=4484. Which is over 4100. So no.\n\nSo no improvement there.\n\nAnother approach: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A75. But as before, that's worse.\n\nSo the best set I can find is 4522. But I need to make sure that this set is valid. Let me check the effort again:\n\nB26:31, B91:133, C24:549, A19:108, A30:669, A47:865, A39:719, C73:737.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n31 +133 = 164\n\n+549 = 713\n\n+108 = 821\n\n+669 = 1490\n\n+865 = 2355\n\n+719 = 3074\n\n+737 = 3811. Correct. Total effort 3811 ≤4100. So that's valid.\n\nNow, the importance is 215+583+808+138+822+780+668+508. Let me add them step by step:\n\n215 +583 = 798\n\n+808 = 1606\n\n+138 = 1744\n\n+822 = 2566\n\n+780 = 3346\n\n+668 = 4014\n\n+508 = 4522. Correct.\n\nSo this set is valid and gives 4522 importance. Is there a way to get higher?\n\nWhat if I include A56 (533) instead of A75 (596)? Let's see. Effort: 3811-596+533=3811-596=3215+533=3748. Importance: 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include A56 and exclude A75. But that's worse.\n\nAnother idea: maybe include C75 (537) and exclude A39. Let's see. Effort: 3811-719+537=3811-719=3092+537=3628. Importance: 4522-668+262=4522-668=3854+262=4116. Still worse.\n\nSo no. So the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a different combination. Let me think of including C75 and B11. For example, if I have A30, B11, A47, C24, B91, C75. Let's calculate effort:\n\n669+835=1494+865=2359+549=2908+133=3041+537=3578. Importance: 822+783+780+808+583+262= let's calculate:\n\n822+783=1605+780=2385+808=3193+583=3776+262=4038. Then, can we add more? 4100-3578=522. So can add A19 (108) → 3578+108=3686. Importance 4038+138=4176. Then add A75 (596) → 3686+596=4282>4100. No. So that's 4176. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, after 3578, add A19 (108) and A75 (596). 3578+108+596=3578+704=4282>4100. No. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. But maybe there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, including C75 and B11. But I don't see a way without exceeding the limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exclude A47 (865) and include other items. Let's see. If I remove A47 (865), effort becomes 3811-865=2946. Then I can add items up to 4100-2946=1154. What items are left? B11 (835), C47 (460), C75 (537), C26 (573), A15 (855), A56 (533), A39 (719), etc. So adding B11 (835) → 2946+835=3781. Importance 4522-780+783=4522-780=3742+783=4525. Then add C47 (460) → 3781+460=4241. Importance 4525+65=4590. Then add C75 (537) → 4241+537=4778>4100. No. So that's 4590. Which is better than 4522. So that's a better set.\n\nSo the set would be A30, B11, C24, B91, C75, A19. Let's check the effort:\n\nA30 (669) + B11 (835) = 1494\n\n+ C24 (549) = 2908\n\n+ B91 (133) = 3041\n\n+ C75 (537) = 3578\n\n+ A19 (108) = 3686. Total effort 3686. Importance: 822+783+808+583+262+138= let's calculate:\n\n822+783=1605+808=2413+583=3000+262=3262+138=3399. Wait, that's not right. Wait, the items are A30 (822), B11 (783), C24 (808), B91 (583), C75 (262), A19 (138). So total importance is 822+783+808+583+262+138. Let's add:\n\n822+783=1605\n\n+808=2413\n\n+583=2996\n\n+262=3258\n\n+138=3396. So 3396. Which is less than 4522. So that's worse. So that's not better.\n\nBut earlier calculation said 4590. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. If I remove A47 (780) and add C75 (262) and B11 (783). Wait, B11 is already in the set. So the initial set without A47 would be A30, B11, C24, B91, C75, A19. Effort: 669+835+549+133+537+108= let's calculate:\n\n669+835=1494\n\n+549=2043\n\n+133=2176\n\n+537=2713\n\n+108=2821. Total effort 2821. Importance: 822+783+808+583+262+138= 822+783=1605+808=2413+583=2996+262=3258+138=3396. So 3396. Which is less than 4522. So that's worse. So my previous calculation was wrong. So that's not better.\n\nSo the initial set of 4522 is better. So I think that's the best I can do. But maybe there's another combination. Let me try including A56 (533) and exclude A75. So effort would be 3811-596+533=3811-596=3215+533=3748. Importance: 4522-484+389=4522-484=4038+389=4427. Which is less than 4522. So no.\n\nAlternatively, include A56 and exclude A39. Effort: 3811-719+533=3811-719=3092+533=3625. Importance: 4522-668+389=4522-668=3854+389=4243. Still less than 4522.\n\nSo the best set is 4522. Now, I need to propose this set. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 4100. Which it is (3811). So the proposal would be the set {B26, B91, C24, A19, A30, A47, A39, C73}.\n\nBut I should also consider that the other participant might have different importance values. Since I don't know theirs, I have to assume that they might value different items. But since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on that.\n\nNow, the next step is to make a proposal. The user's instruction says to use the PROPOSAL format. So I should propose this set. But I need to make sure that the set is valid (effort <=4100). Which it is. So the proposal would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B26', 'B91', 'C24', 'A19', 'A30', 'A47', 'A39', 'C73'}\n\nBut I should also include an ARGUMENT to defend this proposal. The argument should explain why this set is good. For example, it includes high importance items with reasonable effort, maximizing the total importance while staying under the limit.\n\nSo the message would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B26', 'B91', 'C24', 'A19', 'A30', 'A47', 'A39', 'C73'}\nARGUMENT: This proposal includes high importance items like A30 (822), B11 (783), and C24 (808) while keeping the total effort at 3811, which is well under the limit. It balances high-value items with manageable effort to maximize my total importance.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is included. Also, the user said to include the ARGUMENT format at least once. So this message includes both PROPOSAL and ARGUMENT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to negotiate, so maybe first propose a set, then argue. But according to the interaction protocol, the first message can be a proposal with an argument.\n\nSo the first message would be the proposal and the argument. Then the other participant would respond with a proposal or refusal. But since I'm the one starting, I should make the first proposal.\n\nSo the final answer is the proposal and the argument as above.\n",
