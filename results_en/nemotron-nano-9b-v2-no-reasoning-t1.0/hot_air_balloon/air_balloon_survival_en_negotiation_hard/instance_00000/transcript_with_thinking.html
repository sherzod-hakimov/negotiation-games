        <p>You are participating in a collaborative negotiation game.<br/><br/>Together with another participant, you must agree on a single set of items that will be kept. Each of you has your own view of how much each item matters to you (importance). You do not know how the other participant values the items. Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.<br/>You may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:<br/><br/>LIMIT = 3624<br/><br/>Here are the individual item effort values:<br/><br/>Item effort = {&quot;C17&quot;: 210, &quot;B41&quot;: 291, &quot;A71&quot;: 831, &quot;C00&quot;: 111, &quot;B35&quot;: 926, &quot;A77&quot;: 827, &quot;A03&quot;: 25, &quot;A04&quot;: 121, &quot;C54&quot;: 583, &quot;C01&quot;: 766, &quot;A87&quot;: 14, &quot;B32&quot;: 559, &quot;B86&quot;: 304, &quot;B33&quot;: 989, &quot;A10&quot;: 691}<br/><br/>Here is your personal view on the importance of each item:<br/><br/>Item importance values = {&quot;C17&quot;: 138, &quot;B41&quot;: 583, &quot;A71&quot;: 868, &quot;C00&quot;: 822, &quot;B35&quot;: 783, &quot;A77&quot;: 65, &quot;A03&quot;: 262, &quot;A04&quot;: 121, &quot;C54&quot;: 508, &quot;C01&quot;: 780, &quot;A87&quot;: 461, &quot;B32&quot;: 484, &quot;B86&quot;: 668, &quot;B33&quot;: 389, &quot;A10&quot;: 808}<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Your goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well.

This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>You may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>You may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.<br/>Total effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.<br/>Do NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.<br/>A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.<br/>So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}<br/>Strictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.<br/>The game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.<br/>The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.<br/>Only proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven&#x27;t been refused via REFUSE are active.<br/>You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.<br/>You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own total importance while keeping the total effort under 3624. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up the effort values:<br/><br/>C17: 210<br/>B41: 291<br/>A71: 831<br/>C00: 111<br/>B35: 926<br/>A77: 827<br/>A03: 25<br/>A04: 121<br/>C54: 583<br/>C01: 766<br/>A87: 14<br/>B32: 559<br/>B86: 304<br/>B33: 989<br/>A10: 691<br/><br/>Adding these up: 210 + 291 = 501; +831=1332; +111=1443; +926=2369; +827=3196; +25=3221; +121=3342; +583=3925; +766=4691; +14=4705; +559=5264; +304=5568; +989=6557; +691=7248. Oh, that&#x27;s way over the limit of 3624. So we can&#x27;t take all items. Need to select a subset.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize my own importance. So I should prioritize items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate a ratio of importance/effort for each item. Let&#x27;s do that:<br/><br/>C17: 138/210 ≈ 0.657<br/>B41: 583/291 ≈ 1.999<br/>A71: 868/831 ≈ 1.044<br/>C00: 822/111 ≈ 7.396<br/>B35: 783/926 ≈ 0.845<br/>A77: 65/827 ≈ 0.0786<br/>A03: 262/25 ≈ 10.48<br/>A04: 121/121 = 1<br/>C54: 508/583 ≈ 0.871<br/>C01: 780/766 ≈ 1.018<br/>A87: 461/14 ≈ 32.928<br/>B32: 484/559 ≈ 0.866<br/>B86: 668/304 ≈ 2.197<br/>B33: 389/989 ≈ 0.393<br/>A10: 808/691 ≈ 1.169<br/><br/>Looking at these ratios, A87 has the highest ratio (32.928), followed by C00 (7.396), A03 (10.48), B41 (1.999), B86 (2.197), etc. So the strategy would be to take items with the highest importance per effort first. But since the other person&#x27;s importance might differ, maybe they value some items more. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to go with my own.<br/><br/>So the initial proposal should include the highest ratio items. Let&#x27;s start with A87 (14 effort, 461 importance), then C00 (111, 822), A03 (25, 262). Let&#x27;s check the total effort so far: 14 + 111 +25 = 150. That&#x27;s under 3624. Then next high ratio is B41 (291, 583). Adding that: 150+291=441. Then B86 (304, 668): 441+304=745. Then A10 (691, 808): 745+691=1436. Then C54 (583, 508): 1436+583=2019. Then C17 (210, 138): 2019+210=2229. Then A71 (831, 868): 2229+831=3060. Then A04 (121, 121): 3060+121=3181. Then B32 (559, 484): 3181+559=3740. Oh, that&#x27;s over 3624. So can&#x27;t take B32. Next is B35 (926, 783): 3181+926=4107, which is way over. So maybe after A04, we have 3181. Then maybe take B32? No, 3181+559=3740&gt;3624. So maybe skip B32. Then check other items. What&#x27;s left? B33 (989, 389) is too high. A77 (827, 65) is low. So maybe after A04, we have 3181. Then maybe take B32? No. So perhaps the next step is to see if we can add more items without exceeding the limit. Let&#x27;s see: 3181. The remaining effort is 3624-3181=443. So items with effort &lt;=443. Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>A77: 827 (too high)<br/>B32: 559 (too high)<br/>B33: 989 (too high)<br/>C54: 583 (too high)<br/>A71: 831 (too high)<br/>B41: 291 (291 &lt;=443). So adding B41 would make 3181+291=3472. Then remaining effort is 3624-3472=152. Then maybe A04 is already included. What else? A87 is already in. A03 is in. C00 is in. So maybe B86 (304) is too high. So after B41, we have 3472. Then maybe add A77? 827 is over 152. No. So maybe that&#x27;s the maximum. But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. Alternatively, maybe not taking some items to fit more. For example, if I take A87, C00, A03, B41, B86, A10, C54, C17, A71, A04. Let&#x27;s calculate the total effort:<br/><br/>14 (A87) + 111 (C00) +25 (A03) +291 (B41) +304 (B86) +691 (A10) +583 (C54) +210 (C17) +831 (A71) +121 (A04) = let&#x27;s add step by step:<br/><br/>14 +111=125; +25=150; +291=441; +304=745; +691=1436; +583=2019; +210=2229; +831=3060; +121=3181. So total effort is 3181. That&#x27;s under 3624. So maybe we can add more items. What&#x27;s left? B32 (559), B35 (926), B33 (989), A77 (827). The remaining effort is 3624-3181=443. So B32 is 559, which is over. So no. So the current set is 3181. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items by swapping. For example, if we remove some items with lower importance but higher effort and add others. But since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, it&#x27;s hard. Alternatively, maybe the initial proposal should be the set I have so far. But I need to make a proposal. Let me check the total effort again. 3181 is under 3624. So maybe that&#x27;s a good starting point. But maybe I can add more. Let&#x27;s see: 3624-3181=443. Are there any items with effort &lt;=443 that I haven&#x27;t included? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>A77: 827 (no)<br/>B32: 559 (no)<br/>B35: 926 (no)<br/>B33: 989 (no)<br/>C54: 583 (no)<br/>A71: 831 (no)<br/>B41: 291 (already included)<br/>A04: 121 (included)<br/>A03: 25 (included)<br/>C00: 111 (included)<br/>A87: 14 (included)<br/>So no. So the current set is 3181. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if I remove some items with lower importance but higher effort and add others. For instance, if I remove A71 (831 effort, 868 importance) and add B32 (559 effort, 484 importance). But 831-559=272, so the total effort would decrease by 272, allowing adding B32. But 3181 -831 +559 = 3181-272=2909. Then adding B32 (559) would make 2909+559=3468. Then remaining effort is 3624-3468=156. Maybe add A77 (827) no. Or A04 is already in. So maybe that&#x27;s better? But the importance would be 3181 -868 +484 = 3181-384=2797. That&#x27;s worse. So not good. Alternatively, maybe remove A71 and add B32 and something else. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe take B32 instead of A71. But the importance would be 484 vs 868. So that&#x27;s worse. So the initial set is better. So the initial proposal could be the set with A87, C00, A03, B41, B86, A10, C54, C17, A71, A04. Total effort 3181. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more. Let me check if there are other items. For example, B35 (926) is too high. B33 (989) is too high. A77 (827) is too high. So no. So the initial proposal is 3181. But maybe I can add B32 if I remove some other items. For example, if I remove A71 (831) and add B32 (559), the effort would be 3181 -831 +559 = 3181-272=2909. Then remaining effort is 3624-2909=715. Then maybe add B35 (926) which is over. Or B33 (989) no. Or A77 (827) which is under 715. So adding A77 would make 2909+827=3736, which is over. So no. Alternatively, add B32 and A77? 559+827=1386. 2909+1386=4295&gt;3624. No. So that&#x27;s not helpful. So the initial set is better. So the first proposal should be that set. But maybe I can find a better combination. Let me think again. What if I take A87 (14), C00 (111), A03 (25), B41 (291), B86 (304), A10 (691), C54 (583), C17 (210), A71 (831), A04 (121). That&#x27;s 10 items. Total effort 3181. What if I remove A71 (831) and add B32 (559)? Then total effort is 3181-831+559=2909. Then remaining effort is 3624-2909=715. Can I add B35 (926)? No. B33 (989) no. A77 (827) is under 715. So adding A77 would make 2909+827=3736&gt;3624. No. So that&#x27;s not better. Alternatively, remove A71 and add B32 and A77? 559+827=1386. 2909+1386=4295&gt;3624. No. So not helpful. So the initial set is better. So the first proposal should be that set. But maybe there&#x27;s a better way. Let me check the importance of the items in the set. The total importance would be 461 (A87) +822 (C00) +262 (A03) +583 (B41) +668 (B86) +808 (A10) +508 (C54) +138 (C17) +868 (A71) +121 (A04). Let&#x27;s add these:<br/><br/>461+822=1283; +262=1545; +583=2128; +668=2796; +808=3604; +508=4112; +138=4250; +868=5118; +121=5239. So total importance is 5239. That&#x27;s pretty good. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to get more. For example, if I can include B32 (484) instead of some other item. But as before, the effort would be too high. Alternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, if I remove A71 (868) and add B32 (484) and maybe another item. But the effort would be 3181-831+559=2909. Then remaining effort is 715. Maybe add B35 (926) no. Or B33 (989) no. So no. So the initial set is better. So the first proposal should be that set. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 3624. 3181 is under. So that&#x27;s acceptable. Now, the next step is to make a proposal. But the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other person&#x27;s proposal yet. Wait, the user is asking me to generate the first message. So I need to start with a proposal. The first message should be a PROPOSAL. So I need to choose which items to propose. Based on the above analysis, the best set is the one with 3181 effort. So the proposal would be {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;}. But I need to check if that&#x27;s correct. Let me verify the effort again. 14+111=125; +25=150; +291=441; +304=745; +691=1436; +583=2019; +210=2229; +831=3060; +121=3181. Yes. So that&#x27;s correct. So the first message should be a PROPOSAL with those items. Then, the other person might respond with a REFUSE or AGREE. But since I don&#x27;t have their response, I need to proceed. However, the user is asking me to generate the first message. So the first message is a PROPOSAL. Then, in the next steps, I would need to handle the other person&#x27;s response. But for now, the first message is the PROPOSAL. Also, I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING. The STRATEGIC REASONING should be at the beginning of each message. So in the first message, I need to write the STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, then the ARGUMENT. Let me structure that. The STRATEGIC REASONING would explain that I&#x27;m selecting items with the highest importance per effort ratio to maximize my total importance. The ARGUMENT would defend the proposal, perhaps mentioning the high ratios and the total effort. So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By selecting items like A87 (high ratio) and C00 (high ratio), I aim to include as many high-value items as possible without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: This proposal includes items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios, such as A87 (461/14) and C00 (822/111), ensuring maximum personal value while keeping the total effort at 3181, which is well under the 3624 limit. This approach balances high-value items with manageable effort.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is only once per message. Also, the ARGUMENT must be included at least once. So this structure should be correct. Now, I need to format it properly with the tags. Also, the PROPOSAL must be a set. So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By selecting items like A87 (high ratio) and C00 (high ratio), I aim to include as many high-value items as possible without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, &#x27;A03&#x27;, &#x27;B41&#x27;, &#x27;B86&#x27;, &#x27;A10&#x27;, &#x27;C54&#x27;, &#x27;C17&#x27;, &#x27;A71&#x27;, &#x27;A04&#x27;}<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: This proposal includes items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios, such as A87 (461/14) and C00 (822/111), ensuring maximum personal value while keeping the total effort at 3181, which is well under the 3624 limit. This approach balances high-value items with manageable effort.<br/><br/>That should be the first message. Then, depending on the other person&#x27;s response, I would adjust. But since this is the first message, this is the correct approach.<br/></p>

        <p>Your response did not start with the proper strategic reasoning tag at the very beginning of your response. The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}. Try again.</p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING with the reasoning inside. Then follow with the other tags. Let me restructure my response. Start with the strategic reasoning, then the proposal, and the argument. Also, the argument needs to be included at least once. <br/><br/>Wait, in my first attempt, I had the strategic reasoning but maybe it wasn&#x27;t formatted correctly. Let me make sure that the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} and nothing else before that. Also, the user mentioned that the strategic reasoning is hidden, so I should keep it concise but clear.<br/><br/>Let me draft the strategic reasoning again. Maybe focus on the same approach but ensure it&#x27;s the first part. Then proceed with the proposal and argument. Also, check that the total effort is under the limit. The previous proposal was 3181, which is under 3624, so that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>I should also make sure that the AGUMENT is included. In the first response, I had it, but maybe the user wants it in every message? Wait, the rules say &quot;You must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.&quot; So as long as it&#x27;s there once, it&#x27;s okay. But since the user is asking for a new response, I need to include it again here.<br/><br/>Alright, putting it all together. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then PROPOSAL, then ARGUMENT. Make sure the formatting is correct with the tags followed by colon and whitespace. Also, the set elements should be in curly braces with commas. Let me double-check the syntax. Yes, like {&#x27;A87&#x27;, &#x27;C00&#x27;, ...}.<br/><br/>Okay, that should fix the issue. Let me write the response now.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user is pointing out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction history.<br/><br/>In the first attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting was off. The user&#x27;s error message says the very first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me look at my first response again.<br/><br/>Wait, in the first response, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: ... <br/><br/>Then PROPOSAL, then ARGUMENT. That seems correct. But the user is saying it&#x27;s not starting properly. Maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line isn&#x27;t the very first thing in the message. Let me check the exact structure.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says: &quot;The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}.&quot; So the first line of the response must be STRATEGIC REASONING. In my first response, that was the case. But perhaps the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the only thing in the first line, without any other text. Or maybe there was a formatting error in how I presented it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first and only structured tag in the message. Let me make sure that in my response, the first line is exactly STRATEGIC REASONING: followed by the content, and nothing else before it.<br/><br/>In my previous response, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritize items... <br/><br/>Then PROPOSAL: ... <br/><br/>That should be correct. But perhaps the user&#x27;s system is strict about the order. Maybe I need to ensure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first and only structured tag in the message. Let me try again, making sure that the first line is strictly STRATEGIC REASONING: ... and nothing else before it.<br/><br/>Also, the user mentioned that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be included only once at the very beginning of every message. So in each of my responses, the first thing must be STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me structure the response accordingly, ensuring that the first line is exactly that.<br/></p>
