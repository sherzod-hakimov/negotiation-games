Since C01 is highly important to me and its exclusion suggests the opponent is prioritizing different items, I should counter with a proposal that maximizes my total importance. Including C01 would significantly boost my score while staying under the LIMIT. Alternatively, adding B32 (484 importance) or A10 (262 importance) could further optimize the set. My goal is to secure high-value items like C00 (783) and C01 (389) while forcing the opponent to compromise on lower-priority additions.'}  \\ \tt \\ \tt ARGUMENT: {'A71', 'C00', 'B35', 'A04', 'C54', 'B86', 'A87', 'C01'}
