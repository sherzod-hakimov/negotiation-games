    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 3288. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make assumptions or strategies based on my own data.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up the effort values:<br/><br/>C08: 329<br/>C55: 41<br/>A43: 417<br/>A67: 75<br/>B42: 390<br/>A62: 887<br/>B19: 808<br/>C43: 151<br/>C73: 849<br/>C10: 129<br/>B36: 350<br/>A18: 118<br/>C61: 630<br/>C67: 602<br/>C42: 801<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step:<br/><br/>Start with 329 + 41 = 370<br/>+417 = 787<br/>+75 = 862<br/>+390 = 1252<br/>+887 = 2139<br/>+808 = 3047<br/>+151 = 3198<br/>+849 = 4047 (already over 3288)<br/>So, the total effort is way over the limit. So we need to select a subset.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize my importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate a ratio of importance/effort for each item. That way, items that give more importance per unit effort are better.<br/><br/>Let me compute that:<br/><br/>C08: 138 / 329 ≈ 0.419<br/>C55: 583 /41 ≈14.22<br/>A43: 868/417≈2.08<br/>A67: 822/75≈10.96<br/>B42: 783/390≈2.01<br/>A62: 65/887≈0.073<br/>B19: 262/808≈0.324<br/>C43: 121/151≈0.801<br/>C73: 508/849≈0.598<br/>C10: 780/129≈6.05<br/>B36: 461/350≈1.317<br/>A18: 484/118≈4.10<br/>C61: 668/630≈1.06<br/>C67: 389/602≈0.646<br/>C42: 808/801≈1.01<br/><br/>So the highest ratios are C55 (14.22), A67 (10.96), C10 (6.05), A18 (4.10), C43 (0.801), etc. So prioritizing items with high ratios.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure the total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 3288. Let&#x27;s try to select the top items by ratio.<br/><br/>Start with C55 (41 effort, 583 importance). Then A67 (75, 822). Then C10 (129, 780). Then A18 (118, 484). Then maybe C43 (151, 121). Then C08 (329, 138). Let&#x27;s check the total effort:<br/><br/>41 +75 = 116<br/>+129 = 245<br/>+118 = 363<br/>+151 = 514<br/>+329 = 843. That&#x27;s way under 3288. Wait, but maybe there are more items. Let me check the next highest ratios. B36 (350, 461) has a ratio of 1.317. C61 (630, 668) ratio 1.06. C42 (801, 808) ratio 1.01. B19 (808, 262) is low. A62 (887, 65) is very low. C73 (849, 508) ratio 0.598. So maybe after the initial items, adding B36, C61, C42, etc.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s calculate the total effort if we take the top items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C55 (41), A67 (75), C10 (129), A18 (118), C43 (151), C08 (329). Total effort: 41+75=116, +129=245, +118=363, +151=514, +329=843. That&#x27;s 843. Still a lot under 3288. So maybe add more items. Next is B36 (350). 843+350=1193. Then C61 (630) would make 1193+630=1823. Then C42 (801) would be 1823+801=2624. Then maybe C73 (849) would be 2624+849=3473 which is over. So maybe take C73? No, over. What about B19 (808)? 2624+808=3432, also over. So maybe after 2624, we can add some other items. Let&#x27;s see, 3288-2624=664. So items with effort &lt;=664. Let&#x27;s check which items are left. C73 is 849 (too big), B19 is 808 (too big). C67 is 602. 602 is under 664. So adding C67 (602) would make 2624+602=3226. Then remaining effort is 3288-3226=62. Are there any items with effort &lt;=62? Let&#x27;s check. C55 is 41, but already included. A67 is 75 (too big). C10 is 129 (too big). A18 is 118 (too big). C43 is 151 (too big). C08 is 329 (too big). B36 is 350 (too big). C61 is 630 (too big). C42 is 801 (too big). So no. So the total would be 3226. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replace some items. For example, instead of taking C55, A67, C10, A18, C43, C08, B36, C61, C67, maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. Let me think. The highest importance items are A43 (868), C55 (583), C10 (780), A67 (822), B42 (783), C42 (808), etc. But their effort is high. So maybe a balance between high importance and low effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe a greedy approach: sort items by importance/effort ratio descending, then add them until the limit is reached.<br/><br/>Let me list all items sorted by ratio:<br/><br/>1. C55 (14.22)<br/>2. A67 (10.96)<br/>3. C10 (6.05)<br/>4. A18 (4.10)<br/>5. C43 (0.801)<br/>6. B36 (1.317)<br/>7. C61 (1.06)<br/>8. C42 (1.01)<br/>9. C08 (0.419)<br/>10. B19 (0.324)<br/>11. C73 (0.598)<br/>12. A62 (0.073)<br/><br/>So the order is C55, A67, C10, A18, C43, B36, C61, C42, C08, B19, C73, A62.<br/><br/>Now, let&#x27;s add them in this order until the total effort is under 3288.<br/><br/>Start with C55 (41). Total effort: 41. Importance: 583.<br/><br/>Add A67 (75). Total: 116. Importance: 583+822=1405.<br/><br/>Add C10 (129). Total: 245. Importance: 1405+780=2185.<br/><br/>Add A18 (118). Total: 363. Importance: 2185+484=2669.<br/><br/>Add C43 (151). Total: 514. Importance: 2669+121=2790.<br/><br/>Add B36 (350). Total: 864. Importance: 2790+461=3251.<br/><br/>Add C61 (630). Total: 864+630=1494. Wait, no, 864+630=1494? Wait, 864+630 is 1494? No, 800+600=1400, 64+30=94, total 1494. But 1494 is under 3288. So add C61. Importance: 3251+668=3919.<br/><br/>Add C42 (801). Total: 1494+801=2295. Importance: 3919+808=4727.<br/><br/>Now, remaining effort: 3288-2295=993. Next item is C08 (329). 2295+329=2624. Importance: 4727+138=4865.<br/><br/>Next is B19 (808). 2624+808=3432 &gt;3288. Can&#x27;t add. Next is C73 (849). 2624+849=3473&gt;3288. Can&#x27;t add. A62 is 887, also over. So the total is 2624, importance 4865.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if we skip some items to add others. Let&#x27;s see. For instance, if we don&#x27;t take C61 (630) and C42 (801), but take other items. But that would lower the importance. Alternatively, maybe take C73 (849) instead of some others. But 849 is a high effort. Let&#x27;s see: if we take C73 (849) instead of C61 and C42. But 849 is more than 630+801=1431. So that&#x27;s not possible. Alternatively, maybe replace some items. But this seems complicated.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial selection is optimal. But I need to check if there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, maybe not taking C42 (801) but taking other items. But 801 is a high effort, but the importance is 808. If I can&#x27;t take it, maybe take other items. But I don&#x27;t see other items with high importance. So perhaps the initial selection is the best.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the other participant might have different importance values. So my strategy should be to propose a set that is good for me, but also consider that the other person might have different priorities. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to assume that they might have similar or different. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to focus on my own.<br/><br/>So the first step is to propose a set that maximizes my importance. The set I calculated has a total effort of 2624, which is under 3288. But maybe I can add more items. Let me check again. After adding C55, A67, C10, A18, C43, B36, C61, C42, the total is 2295. Then adding C08 (329) brings it to 2624. Then, is there any other item that can be added? Let&#x27;s check the remaining items. The remaining items are B19 (808), C73 (849), A62 (887). All of these are over 993 (3288-2624=664). So no. So the maximum I can get is 2624 effort, 4865 importance.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination. For example, if I don&#x27;t take C42 (801) but take C73 (849) and others. Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s try a different combination. Suppose I take C55 (41), A67 (75), C10 (129), A18 (118), C43 (151), B36 (350), C73 (849). Let&#x27;s calculate the total effort: 41+75=116, +129=245, +118=363, +151=514, +350=864, +849=1713. That&#x27;s under 3288. Then, can I add more? 3288-1713=1575. Let&#x27;s see. Next items: C61 (630), C42 (801), C08 (329), B19 (808), A62 (887). Let&#x27;s add C61 (630): 1713+630=2343. Then C42 (801): 2343+801=3144. Then C08 (329): 3144+329=3473&gt;3288. So can&#x27;t add. So total effort 3144, importance: 583+822+780+484+121+461+508+668+808. Let me calculate that:<br/><br/>583+822=1405, +780=2185, +484=2669, +121=2790, +461=3251, +508=3759, +668=4427, +808=5235. That&#x27;s higher than the previous 4865. So this combination is better. But the effort is 3144, which is under 3288. So maybe this is better. But why didn&#x27;t the previous approach include C73? Because in the sorted list, C73 has a lower ratio (0.598) compared to C42 (1.01). So the greedy approach would have taken C42 first. But in this case, taking C73 allows for more items. However, the total importance is higher here. So maybe this is a better combination.<br/><br/>But how to decide? The problem is that the greedy approach may not always give the optimal solution. So perhaps I need to consider different combinations. However, given the time constraints, maybe the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest importance items with manageable effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other participant&#x27;s importance values could be different. For example, if they value C73 highly, but I don&#x27;t know. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to focus on my own.<br/><br/>So, the initial proposal could be the set with C55, A67, C10, A18, C43, B36, C61, C42, C08. But that&#x27;s 2624 effort. Alternatively, the other combination with C73 instead of C42 and C61. But which is better? Let&#x27;s compare the importance. The first combination (with C42 and C61) gives 4865. The second combination (with C73) gives 5235. So the second is better. But why didn&#x27;t the greedy approach pick that? Because in the sorted list, C42 has a higher ratio than C73. So the greedy approach would take C42 first. But in reality, taking C73 allows for more items. So maybe the greedy approach isn&#x27;t optimal here.<br/><br/>This suggests that the optimal solution requires considering combinations, not just the greedy approach. However, without knowing the other person&#x27;s values, it&#x27;s hard to predict. But since I need to make a proposal, I should choose the set that maximizes my importance. So the second combination (with C73) is better. Let me check the effort again: 41+75+129+118+151+350+849= 41+75=116, +129=245, +118=363, +151=514, +350=864, +849=1713. Then adding C61 (630) would be 1713+630=2343. Then C42 (801) would be 2343+801=3144. Then C08 (329) would be 3144+329=3473&gt;3288. So can&#x27;t add. So the total is 3144, importance 5235. That&#x27;s better than the previous 4865. So this is a better set.<br/><br/>But why didn&#x27;t the greedy approach pick this? Because in the sorted list, C42 has a higher ratio than C73. So the greedy approach would take C42 first. But in this case, taking C73 allows for more items. So the greedy approach isn&#x27;t optimal here. Therefore, I need to find a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s an even better combination. Let&#x27;s try another approach. Let&#x27;s try to maximize the importance. The highest importance items are A43 (868), C55 (583), C10 (780), A67 (822), B42 (783), C42 (808), C61 (668), C73 (508), etc. So if I can include as many of these as possible within the effort limit.<br/><br/>Let me try to include A43 (417), C55 (41), C10 (129), A67 (75), B42 (390), C42 (801), C61 (630), C73 (849). Let&#x27;s calculate the total effort:<br/><br/>417+41=458, +129=587, +75=662, +390=1052, +801=1853, +630=2483, +849=3332. That&#x27;s over 3288. So need to remove some. Let&#x27;s see, 3332-3288=44. So need to reduce by 44. Maybe remove C73 (849) and add something else. But that would lower the importance. Alternatively, remove C42 (801) and add C73. Let&#x27;s see: 2483-801=1682, +849=2531. Then add C08 (329): 2531+329=2860. Then maybe add B19 (808) would be 2860+808=3668&gt;3288. No. Or add C67 (602): 2531+602=3133. Then add C08 (329): 3133+329=3462&gt;3288. No. So maybe this combination is not better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s try to include A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61. Let&#x27;s calculate effort: 417+41=458, +129=587, +75=662, +390=1052, +801=1853, +630=2483. Total effort 2483. Importance: 868+583+780+822+783+808+668. Let&#x27;s add them: 868+583=1451, +780=2231, +822=3053, +783=3836, +808=4644, +668=5312. That&#x27;s 5312 importance with 2483 effort. Then remaining effort is 3288-2483=805. Can we add more items? Let&#x27;s see. C73 (849) is over 805. C08 (329) can be added: 2483+329=2812. Then remaining 3288-2812=476. Maybe add C67 (602) is over. B19 (808) is over. C43 (151) can be added: 2812+151=2963. Then remaining 3288-2963=325. Maybe add C55 (41) again? No, already included. Or C10 (129) is already included. So maybe add C43 (151) and then C08 (329) is 2963+329=3292, which is over. So no. So the total is 2812, importance 5312+121=5433. That&#x27;s better. So this combination is better. But how to get there?<br/><br/>This shows that the optimal set requires careful selection. However, without knowing the other person&#x27;s values, it&#x27;s challenging. But since I need to propose a set, I should aim for the highest possible importance. The combination with A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, and C08 (if possible) would be good. But need to check the effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest importance items with the lowest effort. Let me try to list the items in order of importance:<br/><br/>A43 (868), C55 (583), C10 (780), A67 (822), B42 (783), C42 (808), C61 (668), C73 (508), C08 (138), B36 (461), C67 (389), C43 (121), A18 (484), B19 (262), A62 (65).<br/><br/>So the top items by importance are A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, C73, etc. Now, let&#x27;s try to include as many of these as possible within the effort limit.<br/><br/>Start with A43 (417). Then C55 (41). Total: 458. Then C10 (129): 587. Then A67 (75): 662. Then B42 (390): 1052. Then C42 (801): 1853. Then C61 (630): 2483. Then C73 (849): 2483+849=3332&gt;3288. So can&#x27;t add. So total effort 2483. Importance: 868+583+780+822+783+808+668= let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>868+583=1451, +780=2231, +822=3053, +783=3836, +808=4644, +668=5312. So 5312 importance. Now, remaining effort is 3288-2483=805. Can we add any other items? Let&#x27;s see. C08 (329) can be added: 2483+329=2812. Then remaining 3288-2812=476. Maybe add C67 (602) is over. B36 (350) can be added: 2812+350=3162. Then remaining 3288-3162=126. Maybe add C10 (129) is already included. Or C43 (151) is over. So maybe add C43 (151) would make 3162+151=3313&gt;3288. No. So the total is 3162, importance 5312+461=5773. That&#x27;s better. So this combination is better. But how to get there?<br/><br/>So the set would be A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, B36. Let&#x27;s check the effort: 417+41+129+75+390+801+630+350. Let&#x27;s add them step by step:<br/><br/>417+41=458, +129=587, +75=662, +390=1052, +801=1853, +630=2483, +350=2833. Total effort 2833. Remaining 3288-2833=455. Can we add more? C08 (329) is under 455. So add C08: 2833+329=3162. Remaining 3288-3162=126. Maybe add C10 (129) is already included. Or C43 (151) is over. So total effort 3162, importance 5312+138=5450. That&#x27;s better. So this is a better set.<br/><br/>But this requires careful selection. However, the problem is that I need to propose a set. Since I can&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s values, I have to make a proposal that is good for me. The set with A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, C08 has a total effort of 3162, which is under 3288. The importance is 5450. That&#x27;s a good set. But maybe there&#x27;s even more. Let&#x27;s see. After adding C08, remaining effort is 126. Are there any items with effort &lt;=126? Let&#x27;s check. C55 is 41, but already included. A67 is 75, included. C10 is 129 (over 126). A18 is 118. 118 is under 126. So adding A18 (118) would make 3162+118=3280. Then remaining 8. No items left. So total effort 3280, importance 5450+484=5934. That&#x27;s even better. So this set includes A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, C08, A18. Let&#x27;s check the effort: 417+41+129+75+390+801+630+329+118. Let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>417+41=458, +129=587, +75=662, +390=1052, +801=1853, +630=2483, +329=2812, +118=2930. Wait, that&#x27;s 2930. Wait, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me recheck:<br/><br/>A43:417, C55:41, C10:129, A67:75, B42:390, C42:801, C61:630, C08:329, A18:118.<br/><br/>Adding them:<br/><br/>417 +41 = 458<br/><br/>+129 = 587<br/><br/>+75 = 662<br/><br/>+390 = 1052<br/><br/>+801 = 1853<br/><br/>+630 = 2483<br/><br/>+329 = 2812<br/><br/>+118 = 2930. Total effort 2930. Remaining 3288-2930=358. Can we add more? Let&#x27;s see. C73 (849) is over. B19 (808) over. C67 (602) over. B36 (350) is 350, which is under 358. So add B36: 2930+350=3280. Remaining 8. So total effort 3280. Importance: 5450 (from previous) +461=5911. That&#x27;s better. So this set includes A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, C08, A18, B36. Total effort 3280. Importance 5911. That&#x27;s a good set.<br/><br/>But is this possible? Let me check the effort again. 417+41=458, +129=587, +75=662, +390=1052, +801=1853, +630=2483, +329=2812, +118=2930, +350=3280. Yes. So this is under 3288. So this is a valid set. The importance is 868+583+780+822+783+808+668+138+484+461. Let me add them step by step:<br/><br/>Start with 868 (A43)<br/><br/>+583 (C55) = 1451<br/><br/>+780 (C10) = 2231<br/><br/>+822 (A67) = 3053<br/><br/>+783 (B42) = 3836<br/><br/>+808 (C42) = 4644<br/><br/>+668 (C61) = 5312<br/><br/>+138 (C08) = 5450<br/><br/>+484 (A18) = 5934<br/><br/>+461 (B36) = 6395. Wait, that&#x27;s 6395. But earlier I thought it was 5911. Wait, there&#x27;s a mistake here. Let me recalculate the importance:<br/><br/>A43:868<br/><br/>C55:583 → 868+583=1451<br/><br/>C10:780 → 1451+780=2231<br/><br/>A67:822 → 2231+822=3053<br/><br/>B42:783 → 3053+783=3836<br/><br/>C42:808 → 3836+808=4644<br/><br/>C61:668 → 4644+668=5312<br/><br/>C08:138 → 5312+138=5450<br/><br/>A18:484 → 5450+484=5934<br/><br/>B36:461 → 5934+461=6395.<br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s correct. So the total importance is 6395. That&#x27;s a very high value. But is this possible? Because the effort is 3280, which is under 3288. So this is a valid set. But why didn&#x27;t the previous calculations include this? Because in the initial sorted list, B36 has a lower ratio than C42, but in this case, adding B36 allows for more items. So this shows that the optimal set requires considering combinations, not just the greedy approach.<br/><br/>Therefore, the best proposal would be this set. However, I need to make sure that the total effort is correct. Let me recheck:<br/><br/>A43:417<br/><br/>C55:41 → 417+41=458<br/><br/>C10:129 → 458+129=587<br/><br/>A67:75 → 587+75=662<br/><br/>B42:390 → 662+390=1052<br/><br/>C42:801 → 1052+801=1853<br/><br/>C61:630 → 1853+630=2483<br/><br/>C08:329 → 2483+329=2812<br/><br/>A18:118 → 2812+118=2930<br/><br/>B36:350 → 2930+350=3280. Yes, correct. So total effort 3280, which is under 3288. So this is a valid proposal. The importance is 6395. That&#x27;s a high value. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that this is the best possible. Are there any other items that can be added? The remaining effort is 8. No items with effort &lt;=8. So this is the maximum. <br/><br/>Therefore, the best proposal is this set. However, I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format. The items are A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, C08, A18, B36. <br/><br/>But I should check if there are any other combinations that could yield higher importance. For example, maybe replacing some items. For instance, if I remove B36 (350) and add C73 (849), but that would require 3280 -350 +849 = 3280-350=2930+849=3779&gt;3288. No. Alternatively, remove some other items. But it&#x27;s unlikely. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replace C42 (801) with C73 (849) and others. But 849 is more than 801, so that would increase the effort. For example, if I remove C42 (801) and add C73 (849), the effort would be 2930 -801 +849 = 2930+48=2978. Then remaining effort is 3288-2978=310. Can add C67 (602) is over. C10 is already included. So maybe add C73 and then others. But this might not be better. The importance would be 6395 -808 (C42) +508 (C73) = 6395-808=5587+508=6095. Which is less than 6395. So not better. <br/><br/>Therefore, the set I proposed is better. <br/><br/>So the first step is to propose this set. However, I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted. The items are: A43, C55, C10, A67, B42, C42, C61, C08, A18, B36. <br/><br/>But I should also consider that the other participant might have different importance values. For example, if they value C73 highly, but I don&#x27;t know. However, since I can&#x27;t know, I have to focus on my own. <br/><br/>Therefore, the first proposal should be this set. Then, depending on the other&#x27;s response, I can adjust. But since the user is asking for the first message, I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING, ARGUMENT, and the PROPOSAL. <br/><br/>The STRATEGIC REASONING should explain the reasoning behind the proposal. The ARGUMENT should defend the proposal. <br/><br/>So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I prioritized items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit. By selecting high-impact items like A43, C55, and C10, and balancing with others like B36 and C08, I aim to secure a set that offers the best value for my importance scores.<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: My proposal includes items with high importance relative to their effort, ensuring a strong personal benefit while adhering to the effort limit.<br/><br/>PROPOSAL: {&#x27;A43&#x27;, &#x27;C55&#x27;, &#x27;C10&#x27;, &#x27;A67&#x27;, &#x27;B42&#x27;, &#x27;C42&#x27;, &#x27;C61&#x27;, &#x27;C08&#x27;, &#x27;A18&#x27;, &#x27;B36&#x27;}<br/><br/>This proposal includes the highest importance items with manageable effort, maximizing my total importance while staying within the limit.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the first thing in every message must be STRATEGIC REASONING. I missed that in my first reply.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the very first line is STRATEGIC REASONING. Let me restructure my response. Start with that tag, then the argument, then the proposal. Also, the user mentioned that the strategic reasoning should be a hidden message, so I need to keep it concise but clear.<br/><br/>In my first attempt, I had the strategic reasoning but maybe it wasn&#x27;t the first thing. Let me correct that. Also, the argument needs to be included at least once. The user&#x27;s feedback was specific about the order, so I must adhere strictly.<br/><br/>Let me draft the new response. Start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT, then PROPOSAL. Make sure the sets are correctly formatted. Also, check the effort total to ensure it&#x27;s under 3288. Let me calculate the effort for the proposed items.<br/><br/>Calculating the effort: A43 (417) + C55 (41) + C10 (129) + A67 (75) + B42 (390) + C42 (801) + C61 (630) + C08 (329) + A18 (118) + B36 (350). Adding these up: 417+41=458, +129=587, +75=662, +390=1052, +801=1853, +630=2483, +329=2812, +118=2930, +350=3280. That&#x27;s under 3288, so it&#x27;s valid.<br/><br/>Okay, that works. Now, the strategic reasoning should explain the selection process. Mentioning high importance-to-effort ratio items like A43, C55, C10, and balancing with others. The argument should support the proposal&#x27;s merit. Alright, that should meet the user&#x27;s requirements.<br/></p>
