    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7868. The key is that I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.<br/><br/>First, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it&#x27;s possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Looking at the item effort dictionary:<br/><br/>B21:552, B00:560, A08:76, A27:950, B94:248, B53:871, A23:391, C65:143, A89:293, B67:208, B45:678, C34:737, C12:407, A05:366, B60:768, C92:859, B69:183, A84:231, C06:305, B12:727, A16:148, B85:357, C35:504, B10:549, C15:299, B09:91, B16:527, C81:848, A58:307, C24:214, A30:723, A66:475, B75:23, B46:298, C70:820.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step. Let me start adding:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add B21: 552 → 552<br/><br/>B00: 560 → 552+560=1112<br/><br/>A08:76 → 1188<br/><br/>A27:950 → 2138<br/><br/>B94:248 → 2386<br/><br/>B53:871 → 3257<br/><br/>A23:391 → 3648<br/><br/>C65:143 → 3791<br/><br/>A89:293 → 4084<br/><br/>B67:208 → 4292<br/><br/>B45:678 → 4970<br/><br/>C34:737 → 5707<br/><br/>C12:407 → 6114<br/><br/>A05:366 → 6480<br/><br/>B60:768 → 7248<br/><br/>C92:859 → 8107 (Wait, this is already over 7868. So the total effort of all items is 8107, which exceeds the limit. So we can&#x27;t take all items. Therefore, we need to select a subset.<br/><br/>So the challenge is to pick items that sum to &lt;=7868, and maximize my importance. Since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, I need to focus on my own. But in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. However, since I can&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should aim for a set that&#x27;s valuable to me and has a reasonable effort, leaving room for possible compromises.<br/><br/>But how to approach this? Maybe start by selecting high-importance items with lower effort. Let&#x27;s look at my importance values. For each item, I can calculate importance per effort ratio. That might help in selecting items that give the most value per unit of effort.<br/><br/>Let me compute that for each item:<br/><br/>For example, B21: importance 138, effort 552 → 138/552 ≈ 0.25<br/><br/>B00: 583/560 ≈ 1.04<br/><br/>A08: 868/76 ≈ 11.42 (very high ratio)<br/><br/>A27: 822/950 ≈ 0.865<br/><br/>B94: 783/248 ≈ 3.16<br/><br/>B53: 65/871 ≈ 0.075 (low ratio)<br/><br/>A23: 262/391 ≈ 0.67<br/><br/>C65: 121/143 ≈ 0.85<br/><br/>A89: 508/293 ≈ 1.73<br/><br/>B67: 780/208 ≈ 3.75 (high)<br/><br/>B45: 461/678 ≈ 0.68<br/><br/>C34: 484/737 ≈ 0.656<br/><br/>C12: 668/407 ≈ 1.64<br/><br/>A05: 389/366 ≈ 1.06<br/><br/>B60: 808/768 ≈ 1.05<br/><br/>C92: 215/859 ≈ 0.25<br/><br/>B69: 97/183 ≈ 0.53<br/><br/>A84: 500/231 ≈ 2.16<br/><br/>C06: 30/305 ≈ 0.098<br/><br/>B12: 915/727 ≈ 1.26<br/><br/>A16: 856/148 ≈ 5.78 (very high)<br/><br/>B85: 400/357 ≈ 1.12<br/><br/>C35: 444/504 ≈ 0.88<br/><br/>B10: 623/549 ≈ 1.13<br/><br/>C15: 781/299 ≈ 2.61<br/><br/>B09: 786/91 ≈ 8.64 (extremely high ratio)<br/><br/>B16: 3/527 ≈ 0.0057 (very low)<br/><br/>C81: 713/848 ≈ 0.84<br/><br/>A58: 457/307 ≈ 1.49<br/><br/>C24: 273/214 ≈ 1.28<br/><br/>A30: 739/723 ≈ 1.02<br/><br/>A66: 822/475 ≈ 1.73<br/><br/>B75: 235/23 ≈ 10.22 (very high)<br/><br/>B46: 606/298 ≈ 2.03<br/><br/>C70: 105/820 ≈ 0.128<br/><br/>So the items with the highest importance per effort ratio are:<br/><br/>A08 (11.42), B09 (8.64), B75 (10.22), A16 (5.78), B67 (3.75), A84 (2.16), C15 (2.61), B46 (2.03), A66 (1.73), A89 (1.73), etc.<br/><br/>So prioritizing these high ratio items would maximize my importance per effort. But since the total effort is limited, I need to select a combination that adds up to &lt;=7868.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t take all, I need to find a subset. Let&#x27;s try to build a set starting with the highest ratios.<br/><br/>Start with A08 (76 effort, 868 importance). Then B09 (91 effort, 786). Then B75 (23 effort, 235). Then A16 (148, 856). Then B67 (208, 780). Then A84 (231, 500). Then C15 (299, 781). Then B46 (298, 606). Then A66 (475, 822). Let&#x27;s add these up:<br/><br/>76 +91=167; +23=190; +148=338; +208=546; +231=777; +299=1076; +298=1374; +475=1849. Total effort so far: 1849. That&#x27;s way under 7868. Wait, but maybe I can add more items. Let&#x27;s check the next high ratios. Next could be C12 (407, 668), A05 (366, 389), B12 (727, 915), etc.<br/><br/>But maybe I should calculate the total effort of all high ratio items. Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach would work here. Let&#x27;s try to select items in order of importance per effort, adding them until the total effort is under 7868.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe a dynamic programming approach would be better, but since I&#x27;m doing this manually, I need to approximate.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s list all items sorted by importance per effort descending:<br/><br/>1. A08 (11.42)<br/>2. B09 (8.64)<br/>3. B75 (10.22)<br/>4. A16 (5.78)<br/>5. B67 (3.75)<br/>6. A84 (2.16)<br/>7. C15 (2.61)<br/>8. B46 (2.03)<br/>9. A66 (1.73)<br/>10. A89 (1.73)<br/>11. C12 (1.64)<br/>12. B12 (1.26)<br/>13. B85 (1.12)<br/>14. B10 (1.13)<br/>15. C35 (0.88)<br/>16. C34 (0.656)<br/>17. A27 (0.865)<br/>18. C65 (0.85)<br/>19. B94 (3.16) Wait, B94&#x27;s ratio is 3.16, which is higher than some others. Maybe I missed ordering.<br/><br/>Wait, let me re-sort properly. Let me list all items with their ratios:<br/><br/>A08: 11.42<br/><br/>B09: 8.64<br/><br/>B75: 10.22<br/><br/>A16: 5.78<br/><br/>B67: 3.75<br/><br/>A84: 2.16<br/><br/>C15: 2.61<br/><br/>B46: 2.03<br/><br/>A66: 1.73<br/><br/>A89: 1.73<br/><br/>C12: 1.64<br/><br/>B12: 1.26<br/><br/>B10: 1.13<br/><br/>B85: 1.12<br/><br/>C35: 0.88<br/><br/>A27: 0.865<br/><br/>C65: 0.85<br/><br/>B94: 3.16 (Wait, B94&#x27;s ratio is 783/248 ≈ 3.16, which is higher than B67&#x27;s 3.75? No, 3.16 is less than 3.75. So B67 is higher. So the order should be:<br/><br/>1. A08 (11.42)<br/><br/>2. B75 (10.22)<br/><br/>3. B09 (8.64)<br/><br/>4. A16 (5.78)<br/><br/>5. B67 (3.75)<br/><br/>6. B94 (3.16)<br/><br/>7. A84 (2.16)<br/><br/>8. C15 (2.61)<br/><br/>9. B46 (2.03)<br/><br/>10. A66 (1.73)<br/><br/>11. A89 (1.73)<br/><br/>12. C12 (1.64)<br/><br/>13. B12 (1.26)<br/><br/>14. B10 (1.13)<br/><br/>15. B85 (1.12)<br/><br/>16. C35 (0.88)<br/><br/>17. A27 (0.865)<br/><br/>18. C65 (0.85)<br/><br/>19. B60 (1.05) Wait, B60&#x27;s ratio is 808/768 ≈ 1.05, which is higher than some others. So maybe I need to adjust the order.<br/><br/>This is getting complicated. Maybe I should list all items with their ratios and sort them properly.<br/><br/>Let me create a list:<br/><br/>Item | Importance | Effort | Ratio<br/>A08 | 868 | 76 | 11.42<br/>B09 | 786 | 91 | 8.64<br/>B75 | 235 | 23 | 10.22<br/>A16 | 856 | 148 | 5.78<br/>B67 | 780 | 208 | 3.75<br/>B94 | 783 | 248 | 3.16<br/>A84 | 500 | 231 | 2.16<br/>C15 | 781 | 299 | 2.61<br/>B46 | 606 | 298 | 2.03<br/>A66 | 822 | 475 | 1.73<br/>A89 | 508 | 293 | 1.73<br/>C12 | 668 | 407 | 1.64<br/>B12 | 915 | 727 | 1.26<br/>B10 | 623 | 549 | 1.13<br/>B85 | 400 | 357 | 1.12<br/>C35 | 444 | 504 | 0.88<br/>A27 | 822 | 950 | 0.865<br/>C65 | 121 | 143 | 0.85<br/>B60 | 808 | 768 | 1.05<br/>C92 | 215 | 859 | 0.25<br/>B69 | 97 | 183 | 0.53<br/>C81 | 713 | 848 | 0.84<br/>A58 | 457 | 307 | 1.49<br/>C24 | 273 | 214 | 1.28<br/>A30 | 739 | 723 | 1.02<br/>B53 | 65 | 871 | 0.075<br/>C70 | 105 | 820 | 0.128<br/>B21 | 138 | 552 | 0.25<br/>B16 | 3 | 527 | 0.0057<br/>C06 | 30 | 305 | 0.098<br/><br/>Now sorted by ratio descending:<br/><br/>1.

C70 (0.128)<br/>26. B16 (0.0057)<br/>27. C06 (0.098)<br/><br/>So the correct order is:<br/><br/>1. A08<br/>2. B75<br/>3. B09<br/>4. A16<br/>5. B67<br/>6. B94<br/>7. C15<br/>8. A84<br/>9. B46<br/>10. A66<br/>11. A89<br/>12. C24<br/>13. B12<br/>14. B10<br/>15. B85<br/>16. C35<br/>17. A27<br/>18. C65<br/>19. C81<br/>20. B60<br/>21. B69<br/>22. B21<br/>23. C92<br/>24. C70<br/>25. B16<br/>26. C06<br/><br/>Now, let&#x27;s try to select items in this order until the total effort is under 7868.<br/><br/>Start adding:<br/><br/>A08 (76) → total 76<br/><br/>B75 (23) → 99<br/><br/>B09 (91) → 190<br/><br/>A16 (148) → 338<br/><br/>B67 (208) → 546<br/><br/>B94 (248) → 794<br/><br/>C15 (299) → 1093<br/><br/>A84 (231) → 1324<br/><br/>B46 (298) → 1622<br/><br/>A66 (475) → 2097<br/><br/>A89 (293) → 2390<br/><br/>C24 (214) → 2604<br/><br/>B12 (727) → 3331<br/><br/>B10 (549) → 3880<br/><br/>B85 (357) → 4237<br/><br/>C35 (504) → 4741<br/><br/>A27 (950) → 5691<br/><br/>C65 (143) → 5834<br/><br/>C81 (848) → 6682<br/><br/>B60 (768) → 7450<br/><br/>B69 (183) → 7633<br/><br/>B21 (552) → 8185 (over limit)<br/><br/>So up to B69, total effort is 7633. Then adding B21 would exceed. So the current set up to B69 is 7633. Let&#x27;s check if we can add more items after that. The next items after B69 in the sorted list are B21 (552), which would push over. So maybe we can skip B21 and add other items with lower effort.<br/><br/>Wait, after B69 (183), the next items are B21 (552), which is too much. But maybe there are other items with lower effort that we can add. For example, C70 (820) is too high. C92 (848) is also high. C06 (305) is 305. Adding C06 would make 7633 + 305 = 7938, which is over. So no. What about C35 (504)? 7633 + 504 = 8137, over. C81 (848) is over. So the maximum we can get is up to B69, total effort 7633. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replacing some items. For example, if we remove some lower ratio items and add higher ones. But this is getting complex. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal set is the first 15 items (up to B85) with total effort 4237, but that&#x27;s way under. But maybe we can add more items. Let me check the total effort after B85: 4237. Then adding C35 (504) → 4741. Then A27 (950) → 5691. Then C65 (143) → 5834. Then C81 (848) → 6682. Then B60 (768) → 7450. Then B69 (183) → 7633. Then B21 (552) would be over. So total is 7633. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items by adjusting.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe some items can be swapped. For example, if we remove a high effort item with low ratio and add multiple lower effort items with higher ratios. But this requires more detailed calculation.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items up to the limit. Let&#x27;s calculate the total effort of the first 15 items (up to B85) is 4237. Then adding C35 (504) → 4741. Then A27 (950) → 5691. Then C65 (143) → 5834. Then C81 (848) → 6682. Then B60 (768) → 7450. Then B69 (183) → 7633. Then B21 (552) is over. So total is 7633. But maybe we can add some other items. For example, C70 (820) is too much. C92 (848) is over. C06 (305) would make 7633+305=7938, which is over. So no. So the maximum we can get is 7633. But maybe there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe instead of taking B69 (183), which is low ratio, we can take other items. But B69 has a low ratio, so it&#x27;s better to take higher ratio items. So perhaps the set up to B69 is the best possible. But let&#x27;s check the total importance of that set.<br/><br/>Calculating the importance of the items up to B69:<br/><br/>A08:868<br/><br/>B75:235<br/><br/>B09:786<br/><br/>A16:856<br/><br/>B67:780<br/><br/>B94:783<br/><br/>C15:781<br/><br/>A84:500<br/><br/>B46:606<br/><br/>A66:822<br/><br/>A89:508<br/><br/>C24:273<br/><br/>B12:915<br/><br/>B10:623<br/><br/>B85:400<br/><br/>B69:97<br/><br/>Adding these up:<br/><br/>868 +235 = 1103<br/><br/>+786 = 1889<br/><br/>+856 = 2745<br/><br/>+780 = 3525<br/><br/>+783 = 4308<br/><br/>+781 = 5089<br/><br/>+500 = 5589<br/><br/>+606 = 6195<br/><br/>+822 = 7017<br/><br/>+508 = 7525<br/><br/>+273 = 7798<br/><br/>+915 = 8713<br/><br/>+623 = 9336<br/><br/>+400 = 9736<br/><br/>+97 = 9833.<br/><br/>So total importance is 9833. That&#x27;s a high value. But the effort is 7633, which is under 7868. So there&#x27;s still 7868 - 7633 = 235 effort left. Can we add any other items with effort &lt;=235?<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items (after B69 in the sorted list):<br/><br/>B21 (552) → too much.<br/><br/>C92 (848) → no.<br/><br/>C70 (820) → no.<br/><br/>C06 (305) → 305 &gt; 235. No.<br/><br/>B16 (527) → no.<br/><br/>So no items can be added. So the total importance is 9833. But maybe there&#x27;s a way to include more items by adjusting the selection. For example, maybe replacing some items with higher ratio ones that fit.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the initial selection is optimal. But since I can&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, I need to propose a set that&#x27;s good for me. However, in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should focus on my own.<br/><br/>So the first step is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items. Let&#x27;s propose the set up to B69, which is 7633 effort. But maybe the other person would want to add more items. However, since I can&#x27;t know their importance, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s strong for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes even more items. Let me check if there are other items with lower effort that I can add. For example, C06 (305) is 305, which would make 7633+305=7938, which is over. So no. What about C35 (504)? 7633+504=8137, over. C81 (848) is over. So no. So the maximum is 7633.<br/><br/>But maybe there&#x27;s a different combination. For example, if I exclude some lower ratio items and include others. Let&#x27;s see. Suppose I remove B69 (183) and add C06 (305). But 7633 -183 +305 = 7755. Then maybe add another item. But 7755 + any other item&#x27;s effort. For example, C70 (820) is over. C92 (848) is over. C35 (504) would make 7755+504=8259, over. So no. So that&#x27;s worse.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replace B69 with C06. But B69&#x27;s ratio is 0.53, C06&#x27;s is 0.098. So that&#x27;s worse. So the initial set is better.<br/><br/>Therefore, the best set I can propose is the one with items up to B69, total effort 7633, importance 9833. But I need to check if this is correct.<br/><br/>Wait, let me recount the items in the set:<br/><br/>A08, B75, B09, A16, B67, B94, C15, A84, B46, A66, A89, C24, B12, B10, B85, B69. That&#x27;s 16 items. Let me check the effort again:<br/><br/>76 (A08) +23 (B75) = 99<br/><br/>+91 (B09) = 190<br/><br/>+148 (A16) = 338<br/><br/>+208 (B67) = 546<br/><br/>+248 (B94) = 794<br/><br/>+299 (C15) = 1093<br/><br/>+231 (A84) = 1324<br/><br/>+298 (B46) = 1622<br/><br/>+475 (A66) = 2097<br/><br/>+293 (A89) = 2390<br/><br/>+214 (C24) = 2604<br/><br/>+727 (B12) = 3331<br/><br/>+549 (B10) = 3880<br/><br/>+357 (B85) = 4237<br/><br/>+183 (B69) = 4420? Wait, no. Wait earlier calculation said 7633. Wait, I think I made a mistake in adding. Let me re-calculate the total effort step by step.<br/><br/>Let me list all the items in the set and their efforts:<br/><br/>A08:76<br/><br/>B75:23<br/><br/>B09:91<br/><br/>A16:148<br/><br/>B67:208<br/><br/>B94:248<br/><br/>C15:299<br/><br/>A84:231<br/><br/>B46:298<br/><br/>A66:475<br/><br/>A89:293<br/><br/>C24:214<br/><br/>B12:727<br/><br/>B10:549<br/><br/>B85:357<br/><br/>B69:183<br/><br/>Now adding them in order:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add 76 → 76<br/><br/>+23 → 99<br/><br/>+91 → 190<br/><br/>+148 → 338<br/><br/>+208 → 546<br/><br/>+248 → 794<br/><br/>+299 → 1093<br/><br/>+231 → 1324<br/><br/>+298 → 1622<br/><br/>+475 → 2097<br/><br/>+293 → 2390<br/><br/>+214 → 2604<br/><br/>+727 → 3331<br/><br/>+549 → 3880<br/><br/>+357 → 4237<br/><br/>+183 → 4420.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 4420, not 7633. Oh no! I must have made a mistake earlier. That&#x27;s a big error. So the total effort is 4420, not 7633. That changes everything. So where did I go wrong?<br/><br/>Ah, I think I confused the order. Earlier, when I listed the items up to B69, I thought the total was 7633, but that was incorrect. The correct total is 4420. That&#x27;s a big difference. So I need to re-examine.<br/><br/>So the set I proposed has 4420 effort. That leaves 7868 - 4420 = 3448 effort remaining. So there&#x27;s a lot of room to add more items. So I need to find more items to add.<br/><br/>So the next items in the sorted list after B69 are B21 (552), which would bring total to 4420+552=4972. Then C92 (848) → 4972+848=5820. Then C70 (820) → 5820+820=6640. Then C06 (305) → 6640+305=6945. Then B16 (527) → 6945+527=7472. Then C35 (504) → 7472+504=7976, which is over. So up to B16, total is 7472. Then maybe add C35 (504) is over. So the maximum would be 7472. But let&#x27;s check the importance of this set.<br/><br/>But this is getting complicated. The key is that my initial calculation was wrong. So I need to re-calculate.<br/><br/>So the correct total effort for the set up to B69 is 4420. That&#x27;s way under the limit. So I can add more items. Let&#x27;s proceed.<br/><br/>So after B69, the next items in the sorted list are B21 (552), C92 (848), C70 (820), C06 (305), B16 (527), C35 (504), etc.<br/><br/>Adding B21 (552) → 4420+552=4972. Then C92 (848) → 4972+848=5820. Then C70 (820) → 5820+820=6640. Then C06 (305) → 6640+305=6945. Then B16 (527) → 6945+527=7472. Then C35 (504) → 7472+504=7976 (over). So up to B16, total is 7472. Then maybe add C35 (504) is over. So the maximum is 7472. But maybe there are other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe there are other items with lower effort that can be added. For example, C35 (504) is 504. 7472+504=7976 (over). So no. What about C81 (848)? 7472+848=8320 (over). C70 (820) is over. C06 (305) is 305. 7472+305=7777. Then maybe add another item. For example, C35 (504) would be 7777+504=8281 (over). So no. So the maximum is 7777. But that&#x27;s still under 7868. So 7777. Then maybe add another item. For example, C35 (504) is over. C81 (848) is over. C70 (820) is over. C06 (305) is already added. So maybe add C35 (504) is over. So the total is 7777. But maybe there are other items. Let me check the remaining items.<br/><br/>The remaining items after B16 in the sorted list are C35 (504), C81 (848), C70 (820), C06 (305), B16 (527) (already added?), no. Wait, B16 is in the sorted list after C35? No, in the sorted list, B16 is near the end. So after B16, the next items are C35, C81, C70, C06, etc.<br/><br/>So after adding B16 (527) to reach 7472, adding C35 (504) would be 7472+504=7976 (over). So no. So the maximum is 7472. But maybe there are other items with lower effort. For example, C06 (305) is 305. 7472+305=7777. Then maybe add another item. For example, C35 (504) is over. C81 (848) is over. C70 (820) is over. So no. So the total is 7777. But maybe there are other items. Let me check the list again.<br/><br/>Wait, the items not yet added are:<br/><br/>C35 (504), C81 (848), C70 (820), C06 (305), B16 (527) (already added?), no. Wait, in the set up to B16, we have B16 added. So the remaining items are C35, C81, C70, C06, and others.<br/><br/>So adding C06 (305) to 7472 gives 7777. Then maybe add C35 (504) is over. So 7777 is under 7868. So that&#x27;s possible. So the total effort would be 7777. Then the importance would be the sum of all items up to B16 plus C06.<br/><br/>But this is getting too time-consuming. The key point is that my initial calculation was wrong, and the actual total effort is much lower. So I need to adjust my approach.<br/><br/>So the correct approach is to select items in order of highest importance per effort, adding them until the total effort is under 7868. Let&#x27;s try that again.<br/><br/>Start with A08 (76), B75 (23), B09 (91), A16 (148), B67 (208), B94 (248), C15 (299), A84 (231), B46 (298), A66 (475), A89 (293), C24 (214), B12 (727), B10 (549), B85 (357), B69 (183), B21 (552), C92 (848), C70 (820), C06 (305), B16 (527), C35 (504), etc.<br/><br/>Let me add them step by step:<br/><br/>Start with 0.<br/><br/>Add A08 (76) → 76<br/><br/>B75 (23) → 99<br/><br/>B09 (91) → 190<br/><br/>A16 (148) → 338<br/><br/>B67 (208) → 546<br/><br/>B94 (248) → 794<br/><br/>C15 (299) → 1093<br/><br/>A84 (231) → 1324<br/><br/>B46 (298) → 1622<br/><br/>A66 (475) → 2097<br/><br/>A89 (293) → 2390<br/><br/>C24 (214) → 2604<br/><br/>B12 (727) → 3331<br/><br/>B10 (549) → 3880<br/><br/>B85 (357) → 4237<br/><br/>B69 (183) → 4420<br/><br/>B21 (552) → 4972<br/><br/>C92 (848) → 5820<br/><br/>C70 (820) → 6640<br/><br/>C06 (305) → 6945<br/><br/>B16 (527) → 7472<br/><br/>C35 (504) → 7976 (over)<br/><br/>So up to B16, total is 7472. Then adding C35 would exceed. So the maximum is 7472. But 7868 - 7472 = 396. Are there any items with effort &lt;=396 that I haven&#x27;t added yet?<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items:<br/><br/>C35 (504) → no.<br/><br/>C81 (848) → no.<br/><br/>C70 (820) → no.<br/><br/>C06 (305) → already added.<br/><br/>B16 (527) → already added.<br/><br/>What about C34 (737)? 737 &gt; 396. No. C65 (143) → 143. 7472+143=7615. Then maybe add more. 7615 + 305 (C06) is 7920. Then add C35 (504) is over. So 7920. Then maybe add C81 (848) is over. So 7920 is under 7868? No, 7920 is over. Wait, 7472 + 305 = 7777. Then adding C35 (504) would be 7777+504=8281 (over). So no. So the maximum is 7777. But 7777 is under 7868. So that&#x27;s possible. So the set would be up to B16 plus C06. Let&#x27;s check the importance of that.<br/><br/>But this is getting too involved. The main point is that the initial set I proposed (up to B69) has a total effort of 4420, which is way under the limit. So I can add more items. Therefore, my first proposal should include as many high ratio items as possible.<br/><br/>But since I need to make a proposal, I should propose a set that includes the highest ratio items. Let&#x27;s propose the set up to B16, which is 7472 effort. Then maybe add C06 (305) to reach 7777. Then maybe add C35 (504) is over. So the set would be A08, B75, B09, A16, B67, B94, C15, A84, B46, A66, A89, C24, B12, B10, B85, B69, B21, C92, C70, C06. Let&#x27;s check the total effort:<br/><br/>76+23=99; +91=190; +148=338; +208=546; +248=794; +299=1093; +231=1324; +298=1622; +475=2097; +293=2390; +214=2604; +727=3331; +549=3880; +357=4237; +183=4420; +552=4972; +848=5820; +820=6640; +305=6945; +527=7472. Then adding C06 (305) would make 7777. So total effort 7777. That&#x27;s under 7868. So this set has 7777 effort. The importance would be the sum of all these items.<br/><br/>But calculating that would take time. However, the key is that this set is better than the previous one. So I should propose this set. But since I can&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s importance, I need to propose a set that&#x27;s good for me. However, in a negotiation, the other person might have different priorities. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should focus on my own.<br/><br/>So the first step is to propose a set that includes the highest ratio items. Let&#x27;s propose the set up to B16 and C06, total effort 7777. Then, in the argument, I can explain that I&#x27;m selecting items with high importance per effort to maximize my total importance. The strategic reasoning would be to prioritize items that give the most value per unit of effort, ensuring that the total effort is within the limit while maximizing my own importance.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the proposal is valid. Let me check the total effort again. 7777 is under 7868. So that&#x27;s acceptable. So the proposal would be the set including all these items. However, the exact items need to be listed. But since the user hasn&#x27;t provided the exact list, I need to construct it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the top items. For example, A08, B75, B09, A16, B67, B94, C15, A84, B46, A66, A89, C24, B12, B10, B85, B69, B21, C92, C70, C06. That&#x27;s 20 items. Let me check the effort again:<br/><br/>76 (A08) +23 (B75) = 99<br/><br/>+91 (B09) = 190<br/><br/>+148 (A16) = 338<br/><br/>+208 (B67) = 546<br/><br/>+248 (B94) = 794<br/><br/>+299 (C15) = 1093<br/><br/>+231 (A84) = 1324<br/><br/>+298 (B46) = 1622<br/><br/>+475 (A66) = 2097<br/><br/>+293 (A89) = 2390<br/><br/>+214 (C24) = 2604<br/><br/>+727 (B12) = 3331<br/><br/>+549 (B10) = 3880<br/><br/>+357 (B85) = 4237<br/><br/>+183 (B69) = 4420<br/><br/>+552 (B21) = 4972<br/><br/>+848 (C92) = 5820<br/><br/>+820 (C70) = 6640<br/><br/>+305 (C06) = 7245<br/><br/>+527 (B16) = 7972<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 7972, which is over 7868. Oh no! So I made a mistake here. Adding B16 (527) to 7245 gives 7772, not 7972. Let me recalculate:<br/><br/>After C06 (305) → 7245. Then adding B16 (527) → 7245 + 527 = 7772. Which is under 7868. So total effort is 7772. Then there&#x27;s 7868 - 7772 = 96 left. Are there any items with effort &lt;=96? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items:<br/><br/>C35 (504) → no.<br/><br/>C81 (848) → no.<br/><br/>C70 (820) → no.<br/><br/>B16 is already added. What about C34 (737)? No. C65 (143) → 143. 7772 +143=7915. Then maybe add C35 (504) is over. So 7915. Then maybe add C81 (848) is over. So the maximum is 7915. But 7915 is under 7868? No, 7915 is over. Wait, 7772 +143=7915, which is over 7868. So that&#x27;s not allowed. So the maximum is 7772. So the set up to B16 is 7772. Then maybe add C35 (504) is over. So the maximum is 7772. But 7772 is under 7868. So that&#x27;s acceptable.<br/><br/>So the proposal would be the set including A08, B75, B09, A16, B67, B94, C15, A84, B46, A66, A89, C24, B12, B10, B85, B69, B21, C92, C70, C06, B16. Wait, but adding B16 after C06 would be 7245 +527=7772. So that&#x27;s correct. So the total effort is 7772. Then there&#x27;s 96 left. Are there any items with effort &lt;=96? Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>Looking at the items not in the set:<br/><br/>C35 (504) → no.<br/><br/>C81 (848) → no.<br/><br/>C70 (820) → no.<br/><br/>B16 is already in. What about C34 (737)? No. C65 (143) → 143. 7772 +143=7915 (over). So no. C06 is already in. B16 is in. So no. So the maximum is 7772. So the proposal would be that set. The importance would be the sum of all those items. But since I can&#x27;t calculate it exactly here, I&#x27;ll proceed.<br/><br/>So the first proposal would be this set. Then, in the argument, I can explain that I&#x27;m selecting items with the highest importance per effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit. The strategic reasoning would be to prioritize high ratio items to get the most value for the effort spent.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the proposal is valid. Let me check the effort again. 7772 is under 7868. Yes. So that&#x27;s a valid proposal. Then, the other person might propose a different set, and I would need to respond. But for the first message, I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING and ARGUMENT.<br/><br/>So the first message would be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I am prioritizing items with the highest importance per effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By selecting items like A08, B75, and B09, which offer high value for their effort, I aim to secure a set that is both efficient and valuable. This approach allows me to include as many high-value items as possible without exceeding the effort limit.<br/><br/>ARGUMENT: I propose the set {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B75&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;, &#x27;B67&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;A84&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;A89&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;B85&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;, &#x27;C92&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C06&#x27;, &#x27;B16&#x27;}. This set has a total effort of 7772, which is under the limit, and includes items with the highest importance per effort ratio to maximize my personal gain.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the set is correctly listed. However, since I can&#x27;t compute the exact importance here, the main point is the strategy. The other person might propose a different set, and I would need to respond with REFUSE or ARGUMENT. But for the first message, this is the plan.<br/></p>

        <p>STRATEGIC REASONING: I am focusing on items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. By prioritizing items like A08, B75, and B09, which offer significant value for their effort, I aim to secure a balanced set that leverages my personal priorities. This strategy ensures efficiency in effort allocation while targeting high-impact items.  <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: I propose the set {&#x27;A08&#x27;, &#x27;B75&#x27;, &#x27;B09&#x27;, &#x27;A16&#x27;, &#x27;B67&#x27;, &#x27;B94&#x27;, &#x27;C15&#x27;, &#x27;A84&#x27;, &#x27;B46&#x27;, &#x27;A66&#x27;, &#x27;A89&#x27;, &#x27;C24&#x27;, &#x27;B12&#x27;, &#x27;B10&#x27;, &#x27;B85&#x27;, &#x27;B69&#x27;, &#x27;B21&#x27;, &#x27;C92&#x27;, &#x27;C70&#x27;, &#x27;C06&#x27;, &#x27;B16&#x27;}. This set has a total effort of 7772, leaving 96 units of effort unused, which could allow for minor adjustments if needed. The selection is based on maximizing my importance per unit of effort, ensuring a strong personal benefit.</p>

        <p>Okay, the user pointed out that my previous response didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. Let me check the interaction protocol again. Oh right, the STRATEGIC REASONING must be the very first part of every message. I missed that in my first attempt.<br/><br/>So I need to make sure that the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING: followed by my reasoning. Then proceed with the other tags like ARGUMENT. Let me restructure my response accordingly. <br/><br/>In the previous response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING after the ARGUMENT. That&#x27;s incorrect. The correct order is STRATEGIC REASONING first, then ARGUMENT. Also, the user mentioned that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be hidden from the other player, so I need to keep that in mind when formulating it.<br/><br/>Let me draft the STRATEGIC REASONING again. Maybe something like: &quot;I will prioritize items with high importance-to-effort ratios to maximize my total importance within the limit. Starting with A08, B75, and B09, which offer significant value for their effort. Then adding other high-impact items while monitoring the total effort to stay under 7868.&quot;<br/><br/>Then the ARGUMENT should follow. Also, need to ensure that the set proposed is valid and the effort is under the limit. Let me calculate the effort for the previous set to confirm. The previous set had 7772, which is under 7868. So that&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Wait, but maybe I can include more items if possible. However, the user&#x27;s goal is to maximize their own importance, so even if there&#x27;s some effort left, it&#x27;s better to include items that give the most importance per effort. <br/><br/>Another thing: the user&#x27;s importance values are hidden, so I can&#x27;t reveal them. The strategic reasoning should be about the approach, not the specific numbers. <br/><br/>So the corrected response should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT. Also, need to make sure that the set is properly formatted as a Python set. <br/><br/>Let me put it all together. The first line is STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT with the set. Also, check that all other rules are followed, like not revealing importance scores, using the correct tags, etc.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let me figure out what&#x27;s going wrong here. The user is pointing out that my previous responses didn&#x27;t start with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag at the very beginning. In my last attempt, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the formatting wasn&#x27;t correct. Let me check the exact structure required.<br/><br/>The user specified that the first structured format must be STRATEGIC REASONING: {...} and that it should be the very first part of the response. In my previous message, I had STRATEGIC REASONING: followed by the reasoning, then ARGUMENT. But perhaps the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING tag wasn&#x27;t the absolute first thing in the message. Maybe there was some leading whitespace or it wasn&#x27;t properly formatted as the first line.<br/><br/>Wait, looking at the user&#x27;s error message, they said &quot;The very first structured format must be of the form STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}.&quot; So the first thing in the response should be that tag. In my last response, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize... <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {...}<br/><br/>But maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line wasn&#x27;t the first line. Let me check the exact structure. The user&#x27;s example in the initial prompt shows that the STRATEGIC REASONING should be the first part. So perhaps in my response, the STRATEGIC REASONING line was correctly placed, but maybe the user&#x27;s system is expecting it to be the very first thing without any other text before it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a separate line, not part of a paragraph. Let me make sure that in my response, the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, followed by the ARGUMENT. <br/><br/>In my last attempt, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items... <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {&#x27;A08&#x27;, ...}<br/><br/>That should be correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line wasn&#x27;t properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax. The user said: &quot;A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings. So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}&quot;<br/><br/>So the STRATEGIC REASONING should be &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {...}&quot; where the ... is the reasoning text. In my previous response, I had &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...&quot; which is correct. But perhaps the user&#x27;s system is not recognizing it because of some formatting issue, like missing quotes or incorrect structure. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a separate message, but the user&#x27;s instruction says that each message must start with STRATEGIC REASONING. So each message from me should start with that tag. <br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s interaction protocol says: &quot;You must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often.&quot; So each message I send must start with STRATEGIC REASONING. <br/><br/>In my previous response, I did start with STRATEGIC REASONING, but maybe the user&#x27;s system is not parsing it correctly. Let me try to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first line, with no other text before it. <br/><br/>So, the correct structure should be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: [reasoning text here]<br/><br/>Then the ARGUMENT or other tags. <br/><br/>In my last response, I had:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items... <br/><br/>ARGUMENT: {...}<br/><br/>That should be correct. But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the problem is that the STRATEGIC REASONING line is not properly formatted. Let me check the exact syntax again. The user said: &quot;A tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings. So, it must be of the form TAG: {...}&quot;<br/><br/>So for STRATEGIC REASONING, the format is &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {reasoning text}&quot;. The reasoning text is a string, not a set. So in my previous response, I had &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...&quot; which is correct. <br/><br/>But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the issue is that the reasoning text is not properly enclosed in quotes or something. Wait, no, the STRATEGIC REASONING is a tag followed by a colon and then the reasoning text. The reasoning text is just a string, not a set. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a separate line, and the ARGUMENT to be on the next line. But in my response, I have both in the same message. <br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s example in the initial prompt shows that the STRATEGIC REASONING is a hidden message, and the other tags are visible. So each message from me should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then other tags. <br/><br/>Perhaps the problem is that in my previous response, the STRATEGIC REASONING line was not the first line. Let me check. In the last response, the first line was &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize...&quot; which is correct. <br/><br/>But the user is still getting an error. Maybe the issue is that the STRATEGIC REASONING is not properly formatted. Let me try to reformat it exactly as required. <br/><br/>So, the correct first line should be:<br/><br/>STRATEGIC REASONING: [reasoning text]<br/><br/>Then the ARGUMENT or other tags. <br/><br/>In my previous response, I had that. But maybe the user&#x27;s system is not recognizing it because of some missing or extra characters. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the STRATEGIC REASONING to be a separate message, but the user&#x27;s instruction says that each message must start with it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is using a system that requires the STRATEGIC REASONING to be the first thing in the message, with no other text before it. <br/><br/>In any case, to comply with the user&#x27;s requirement, I need to make sure that the first line of my response is exactly &quot;STRATEGIC REASONING: {reasoning text}&quot; with no other content before it. <br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll adjust my response to ensure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the very first line, properly formatted, and then proceed with the ARGUMENT or other tags.<br/></p>
