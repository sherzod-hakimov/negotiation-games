            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 9475. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nB21:944, B00:568, A08:515, A27:239, B94:876, B53:421, A23:991, C65:281, A89:788, B67:678, B45:432, C34:409, C12:279, A05:506, B60:101, C92:686, B69:851, A84:854, C06:133, B12:192, A16:573, B85:17, C35:465, B10:772, C15:46, B09:501, B16:220, C81:404, A58:843, C24:748, A30:552, A66:843, B75:947, B46:345, C70:930.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd B21: 944 → total 944\n\nB00: 568 → 944+568=1512\n\nA08:515 → 1512+515=2027\n\nA27:239 → 2027+239=2266\n\nB94:876 → 2266+876=3142\n\nB53:421 → 3142+421=3563\n\nA23:991 → 3563+991=4554\n\nC65:281 → 4554+281=4835\n\nA89:788 → 4835+788=5623\n\nB67:678 → 5623+678=6301\n\nB45:432 → 6301+432=6733\n\nC34:409 → 6733+409=7142\n\nC12:279 → 7142+279=7421\n\nA05:506 → 7421+506=7927\n\nB60:101 → 7927+101=8028\n\nC92:686 → 8028+686=8714\n\nB69:851 → 8714+851=9565 → Oh, this is over 9475. So adding B69 would exceed the limit. So the total effort of all items is 9565, which is over the limit. Therefore, we can't take all items. So we need to select a subset.\n\nSo the first step is to figure out which items to include. Since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should prioritize items with high importance relative to their effort. That is, items where importance/effort ratio is high. This is similar to the knapsack problem where you maximize value per weight.\n\nLet me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. Let's list them:\n\nB21: 138/944 ≈ 0.146\n\nB00: 583/568 ≈ 1.026\n\nA08: 868/515 ≈ 1.685\n\nA27: 822/239 ≈ 3.439\n\nB94: 783/876 ≈ 0.894\n\nB53: 65/421 ≈ 0.154\n\nA23: 262/991 ≈ 0.265\n\nC65: 121/281 ≈ 0.431\n\nA89: 508/788 ≈ 0.645\n\nB67: 780/678 ≈ 1.149\n\nB45: 461/432 ≈ 1.067\n\nC34: 484/409 ≈ 1.183\n\nC12: 668/279 ≈ 2.394\n\nA05: 389/506 ≈ 0.769\n\nB60: 808/101 ≈ 8.0 (this is a high ratio)\n\nC92: 215/686 ≈ 0.313\n\nB69: 97/851 ≈ 0.114\n\nA84: 500/854 ≈ 0.586\n\nC06: 30/133 ≈ 0.226\n\nB12: 915/192 ≈ 4.766\n\nA16: 856/573 ≈ 1.494\n\nB85: 400/17 ≈ 23.529 (this is extremely high)\n\nC35: 444/465 ≈ 0.955\n\nB10: 623/772 ≈ 0.807\n\nC15: 781/46 ≈ 16.978 (also very high)\n\nB09: 786/501 ≈ 1.569\n\nB16: 3/220 ≈ 0.014\n\nC81: 713/404 ≈ 1.765\n\nA58: 457/843 ≈ 0.542\n\nC24: 273/748 ≈ 0.365\n\nA30: 739/552 ≈ 1.339\n\nA66: 822/843 ≈ 0.975\n\nB75: 235/947 ≈ 0.248\n\nB46: 606/345 ≈ 1.757\n\nC70: 968/930 ≈ 1.041\n\nSo the highest ratios are B85 (23.5), C15 (16.98), B12 (4.77), A27 (3.44), C34 (1.18), B67 (1.15), B46 (1.76), A08 (1.68), etc.\n\nSo the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most value per unit effort. This way, we can maximize the total importance while staying under the limit.\n\nNow, let's start building the set. Let's start with the highest ratios.\n\nFirst, B85: effort 17, importance 400. Adding this gives effort 17, importance 400.\n\nNext, C15: effort 46, importance 781. Total effort 17+46=63, importance 400+781=1181.\n\nNext, B12: effort 192, importance 915. Total effort 63+192=255, importance 1181+915=2096.\n\nNext, A27: effort 239, importance 822. Total effort 255+239=494, importance 2096+822=2918.\n\nNext, C34: effort 409, importance 484. Total effort 494+409=903, importance 2918+484=3402.\n\nNext, B67: effort 678. Adding this would make total effort 903+678=1581. That's under 9475. So add it. Importance becomes 3402+780=4182.\n\nNext, B46: effort 345. Total effort 1581+345=1926. Importance 4182+606=4788.\n\nNext, A08: effort 515. 1926+515=2441. Importance 4788+868=5656.\n\nNext, B60: effort 101. 2441+101=2542. Importance 5656+808=6464.\n\nNext, A30: effort 552. 2542+552=3094. Importance 6464+739=7203.\n\nNext, C81: effort 404. 3094+404=3498. Importance 7203+713=7916.\n\nNext, A16: effort 573. 3498+573=4071. Importance 7916+856=8772.\n\nNext, B00: effort 568. 4071+568=4639. Importance 8772+583=9355.\n\nNext, A58: effort 843. 4639+843=5482. Importance 9355+457=9812.\n\nNext, C24: effort 748. 5482+748=6230. Importance 9812+273=10085.\n\nNext, A66: effort 843. 6230+843=7073. Importance 10085+822=10907.\n\nNext, B09: effort 501. 7073+501=7574. Importance 10907+786=11693.\n\nNext, C06: effort 133. 7574+133=7707. Importance 11693+30=11723.\n\nNext, B16: effort 220. 7707+220=7927. Importance 11723+3=11726.\n\nNext, C12: effort 279. 7927+279=8206. Importance 11726+668=12394.\n\nNext, B10: effort 772. 8206+772=8978. Importance 12394+623=13017.\n\nNext, C35: effort 465. 8978+465=9443. Importance 13017+444=13461.\n\nNow, the next item would be B75: effort 947. Adding this would make 9443+947=10390, which is over the limit. So can't add. Similarly, C70: 930. 9443+930=10373, also over. A23: 991. 9443+991=10434, over. B94: 876. 9443+876=10319, over. A89: 788. 9443+788=10231, over. C92: 686. 9443+686=10129, over. B69: 851. 9443+851=10294, over. A84: 854. 9443+854=10297, over. C65: 281. 9443+281=9724, which is under. So adding C65 would be possible. Let's check: 9443+281=9724. Importance 13461+121=13582.\n\nThen, maybe add more. Let's see. After C65, total effort is 9724. Remaining limit is 9475-9724? Wait, no. Wait, the total effort must be ≤9475. Wait, 9724 is over 9475. Wait, no. Wait, 9475 is the limit. So 9724 is over. So that's a problem. So adding C65 would exceed the limit. So that's not allowed. So I need to check that.\n\nWait, after adding up to C35, the total effort is 9443. Then, adding C65 (281) would make 9443+281=9724, which is over 9475. So that's not allowed. So I can't add C65. So the next possible items would be those with lower effort. Let's see what's left.\n\nAfter C35, the items added so far are:\n\nB85, C15, B12, A27, C34, B67, B46, A08, B60, A30, C81, A16, B00, A58, C24, A66, B09, C06, B16, C12, B10, C35.\n\nWait, let me check the order again. Let me list the items in the order they were added:\n\n1. B85 (17)\n2. C15 (46)\n3. B12 (192)\n4. A27 (239)\n5. C34 (409)\n6. B67 (678)\n7. B46 (345)\n8. A08 (515)\n9. B60 (101)\n10. A30 (552)\n11. C81 (404)\n12. A16 (573)\n13. B00 (568)\n14. A58 (843)\n15. C24 (748)\n16. A66 (843)\n17. B09 (501)\n18. C06 (133)\n19. B16 (220)\n20. C12 (279)\n21. B10 (772)\n22. C35 (465)\n\nTotal effort after C35 is 9443. Now, the remaining items are:\n\nA23 (991), B94 (876), C65 (281), C92 (686), B69 (851), A84 (854), C70 (930), B75 (947), etc.\n\nSo after C35, the total effort is 9443. The remaining limit is 9475 - 9443 = 32. So we can only add items with effort ≤32. Let's check which items are left and have effort ≤32.\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA23: 991 (too big)\nB94: 876 (too big)\nC65: 281 (too big)\nC92: 686 (too big)\nB69: 851 (too big)\nA84: 854 (too big)\nC70: 930 (too big)\nB75: 947 (too big)\nB16: already added (220)\nB85: added\nC15: added\nB12: added\nA27: added\nC34: added\nB67: added\nB46: added\nA08: added\nB60: added\nA30: added\nC81: added\nA16: added\nB00: added\nA58: added\nC24: added\nA66: added\nB09: added\nC06: added\nB10: added\nC35: added\n\nSo the remaining items are all with effort higher than 32. So we can't add any more items. So the total effort is 9443, which is under 9475. So the total importance is 13461.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better combination. Maybe by not taking some items with lower ratios but higher importance, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to swap some items to get a higher total importance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a better combination. For example, maybe instead of taking some items with lower ratios, but higher importance, but that would require more effort. But since the limit is tight, it's better to maximize the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, maybe not taking some items with lower ratios but higher effort, and instead taking others.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is the best. So the proposed set would be the items added up to C35, which is 22 items. Let me check the total effort again to make sure.\n\nLet me recalculate the total effort step by step:\n\nB85:17 → 17\n\nC15:46 → 17+46=63\n\nB12:192 → 63+192=255\n\nA27:239 → 255+239=494\n\nC34:409 → 494+409=903\n\nB67:678 → 903+678=1581\n\nB46:345 → 1581+345=1926\n\nA08:515 → 1926+515=2441\n\nB60:101 → 2441+101=2542\n\nA30:552 → 2542+552=3094\n\nC81:404 → 3094+404=3498\n\nA16:573 → 3498+573=4071\n\nB00:568 → 4071+568=4639\n\nA58:843 → 4639+843=5482\n\nC24:748 → 5482+748=6230\n\nA66:843 → 6230+843=7073\n\nB09:501 → 7073+501=7574\n\nC06:133 → 7574+133=7707\n\nB16:220 → 7707+220=7927\n\nC12:279 → 7927+279=8206\n\nB10:772 → 8206+772=8978\n\nC35:465 → 8978+465=9443\n\nYes, that's correct. 9443 is under 9475. So the total effort is 9443, which is within the limit. The total importance is 13461.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to add more items. For example, after C35, the remaining effort is 9475 - 9443 = 32. Are there any items with effort ≤32 that I haven't included yet?\n\nLooking at the list of items:\n\nB85 (17) is already included.\n\nC15 (46) is included.\n\nB12 (192) included.\n\nA27 (239) included.\n\nC34 (409) included.\n\nB67 (678) included.\n\nB46 (345) included.\n\nA08 (515) included.\n\nB60 (101) included.\n\nA30 (552) included.\n\nC81 (404) included.\n\nA16 (573) included.\n\nB00 (568) included.\n\nA58 (843) included.\n\nC24 (748) included.\n\nA66 (843) included.\n\nB09 (501) included.\n\nC06 (133) included.\n\nB16 (220) included.\n\nC12 (279) included.\n\nB10 (772) included.\n\nC35 (465) included.\n\nSo the remaining items are:\n\nA23 (991), B94 (876), C65 (281), C92 (686), B69 (851), A84 (854), C70 (930), B75 (947).\n\nAll of these have effort higher than 32. So no, can't add any more. So the total is 9443.\n\nBut maybe there's a different combination where we can include more items. For example, maybe by not taking some items with lower ratios but higher effort, and instead taking others. Let's think.\n\nFor example, suppose I don't take C35 (465 effort, 444 importance). Then, I could have 9443 - 465 = 8978 effort. Then, maybe add some other items. But what's left? The remaining items are those with effort over 32. For example, C65 (281) is 281, which is over 32. So even if I remove C35, I can't add C65. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove some items with lower ratios and add others. For example, if I remove B16 (220 effort, 3 importance), then I have 9443 - 220 = 9223. Then, I can add items with effort up to 9475 - 9223 = 252. Are there any items with effort ≤252 that I haven't included?\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA23 (991) no.\n\nB94 (876) no.\n\nC65 (281) no.\n\nC92 (686) no.\n\nB69 (851) no.\n\nA84 (854) no.\n\nC70 (930) no.\n\nB75 (947) no.\n\nSo no. So removing B16 doesn't help. Similarly, removing other items with low ratios might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to select items. For example, maybe prioritize items with higher importance even if their ratio is lower. But that's risky because it might use up more effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is the best. So the proposed set would be the 22 items listed above. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 9475. Which it is (9443).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the total effort of the selected items must not exceed the limit. So 9443 is acceptable.\n\nSo the first proposal would be to include all these items. But I need to check if that's the case. However, the user hasn't provided the other participant's importance values, so I can't know if they would agree. But the goal is to make a proposal that maximizes my own importance.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to make a proposal. So the first step is to make a PROPOSAL with the set of items that I think is optimal. However, the user might have a different set. But since I don't know their importance values, I have to proceed with my own.\n\nBut the problem is that the other participant might have different importance values. For example, if they value C70 highly, but I don't, then including C70 might not be good for me. But since I don't know their values, I have to proceed with my own.\n\nSo the first proposal would be the set of items I calculated. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 9475. Which it is.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. Let me check again. For example, maybe instead of taking C35 (465 effort, 444 importance), I could take another item. But I don't see any other items with lower effort that I can add. So perhaps this is the best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, maybe taking some items with lower ratios but higher importance. But given the effort constraints, it's unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: calculate the maximum possible importance under the limit. This is similar to the 0-1 knapsack problem. But since I can't compute it here manually, I have to rely on the greedy approach based on ratios.\n\nSo the initial proposal is the set of items added up to C35. Let me list them:\n\n{'B85', 'C15', 'B12', 'A27', 'C34', 'B67', 'B46', 'A08', 'B60', 'A30', 'C81', 'A16', 'B00', 'A58', 'C24', 'A66', 'B09', 'C06', 'B16', 'C12', 'B10', 'C35'}\n\nBut I need to check if this is correct. Let me count the items:\n\n1. B85\n2. C15\n3. B12\n4. A27\n5. C34\n6. B67\n7. B46\n8. A08\n9. B60\n10. A30\n11. C81\n12. A16\n13. B00\n14. A58\n15. C24\n16. A66\n17. B09\n18. C06\n19. B16\n20. C12\n21. B10\n22. C35\n\nYes, 22 items. Total effort 9443. Importance 13461.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to include more items. For example, if I remove some items with lower ratios and add others. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if I remove B16 (220 effort, 3 importance), then I have 9443 - 220 = 9223. Then, I can add items with effort up to 9475 - 9223 = 252. Are there any items with effort ≤252 that I haven't included?\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA23 (991) no.\n\nB94 (876) no.\n\nC65 (281) no.\n\nC92 (686) no.\n\nB69 (851) no.\n\nA84 (854) no.\n\nC70 (930) no.\n\nB75 (947) no.\n\nSo no. So removing B16 doesn't help. Similarly, removing other items with low ratios might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I take C65 (281 effort, 121 importance) instead of some other items. But adding C65 would require 281 effort. Let's see. If I remove some items to make space for C65.\n\nFor example, if I remove B10 (772 effort, 623 importance), then I can add C65 (281). The total effort would be 9443 - 772 + 281 = 9443 - 772 = 8671 + 281 = 8952. Then, I can add other items. But what's left? The remaining items would be those not in the original set. But this might not be better. The importance would be 13461 - 623 + 121 = 13461 - 502 = 12959, which is less than 13461. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove a lower importance item. For example, remove B16 (3 importance) and add C65 (121). The total importance would be 13461 -3 +121 = 13579. But the effort would be 9443 -220 +281 = 9443 -220=9223 +281=9504, which is over the limit. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo that's not possible. So the initial proposal seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, the first proposal should be the set of items I listed. But I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format.\n\nBut wait, the user's instruction says that I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING in each message. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden. So in the first message, I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, and the ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B85', 'C15', 'B12', 'A27', 'C34', 'B67', 'B46', 'A08', 'B60', 'A30', 'C81', 'A16', 'B00', 'A58', 'C24', 'A66', 'B09', 'C06', 'B16', 'C12', 'B10', 'C35'}\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is included. The ARGUMENT is to defend the last proposal or argue against the opponent's. Since this is the first message, the ARGUMENT would be defending the proposal.\n\nSo the ARGUMENT could be something like: \"This proposal maximizes my importance by prioritizing items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios, ensuring efficient use of the limited effort budget.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is a set. Wait, no. The ARGUMENT is a string, not a set. Wait, looking back at the interaction protocol:\n\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\n\nWait, the format is ARGUMENT: {'...'}, but the content is a string. So the ARGUMENT is a string, not a set. So the user's example shows that the ARGUMENT is a string. So in the message, it's written as ARGUMENT: {'...'}, but the content is a string. So for example, ARGUMENT: \"This proposal focuses on high importance-to-effort items to maximize my total value.\"\n\nSo in the first message, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden, the PROPOSAL is the set, and the ARGUMENT is a string defending the proposal.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'Prioritize items with highest importance/effort ratios to maximize my total importance within the limit.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B85', 'C15', 'B12', 'A27', 'C34', 'B67', 'B46', 'A08', 'B60', 'A30', 'C81', 'A16', 'B00', 'A58', 'C24', 'A66', 'B09', 'C06', 'B16', 'C12', 'B10', 'C35'}\nARGUMENT: \"This proposal selects items with the highest importance per unit effort, ensuring maximum value while staying under the limit.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that the PROPOSAL is a valid set. Also, check if the total effort is under 9475. As calculated, it's 9443, which is under.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the total effort:\n\nB85:17\n\nC15:46 → 63\n\nB12:192 → 255\n\nA27:239 → 494\n\nC34:409 → 903\n\nB67:678 → 1581\n\nB46:345 → 1926\n\nA08:515 → 2441\n\nB60:101 → 2542\n\nA30:552 → 3094\n\nC81:404 → 3498\n\nA16:573 → 4071\n\nB00:568 → 4639\n\nA58:843 → 5482\n\nC24:748 → 6230\n\nA66:843 → 7073\n\nB09:501 → 7574\n\nC06:133 → 7707\n\nB16:220 → 7927\n\nC12:279 → 8206\n\nB10:772 → 8978\n\nC35:465 → 9443\n\nYes, that's correct. 9443 is under 9475.\n\nSo this seems like a valid proposal. However, the user might have a different set. But since I don't know their importance values, this is the best I can do.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some items with lower ratios but higher effort, and include others. For example, maybe instead of taking B67 (678 effort, 780 importance), which has a ratio of 1.15, maybe take another item with higher ratio. But I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the other participant's importance values. If they value some items highly that I don't, they might reject my proposal. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own.\n\nSo the first proposal is as above. Now, the next step would be to wait for the opponent's response. But since this is the first message, I need to send this proposal.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING in each message. So the first message must have all three: STRATEGIC REASONING, PROPOSAL, ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the final answer would be the first message with these elements.\n",

                "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 9475. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nB21:944, B00:568, A08:515, A27:239, B94:876, B53:421, A23:991, C65:281, A89:788, B67:678, B45:432, C34:409, C12:279, A05:506, B60:101, C92:686, B69:851, A84:854, C06:133, B12:192, A16:573, B85:17, C35:465, B10:772, C15:46, B09:501, B16:220, C81:404, A58:843, C24:748, A30:552, A66:843, B75:947, B46:345, C70:930.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd B21: 944 → total 944\n\nB00: 568 → 944+568=1512\n\nA08:515 → 1512+515=2027\n\nA27:239 → 2027+239=2266\n\nB94:876 → 2266+876=3142\n\nB53:421 → 3142+421=3563\n\nA23:991 → 3563+991=4554\n\nC65:281 → 4554+281=4835\n\nA89:788 → 4835+788=5623\n\nB67:678 → 5623+678=6301\n\nB45:432 → 6301+432=6733\n\nC34:409 → 6733+409=7142\n\nC12:279 → 7142+279=7421\n\nA05:506 → 7421+506=7927\n\nB60:101 → 7927+101=8028\n\nC92:686 → 8028+686=8714\n\nB69:851 → 8714+851=9565 → Oh, this is over 9475. So adding B69 would exceed the limit. So the total effort of all items is 9565, which is over the limit. Therefore, we can't take all items. So we need to select a subset.\n\nSo the first step is to figure out which items to include. Since my goal is to maximize my own importance, I should prioritize items with high importance relative to their effort. That is, items where importance/effort ratio is high. This is similar to the knapsack problem where you maximize value per weight.\n\nLet me calculate the importance/effort ratio for each item. Let's list them:\n\nB21: 138/944 ≈ 0.146\n\nB00: 583/568 ≈ 1.026\n\nA08: 868/515 ≈ 1.685\n\nA27: 822/239 ≈ 3.439\n\nB94: 783/876 ≈ 0.894\n\nB53: 65/421 ≈ 0.154\n\nA23: 262/991 ≈ 0.265\n\nC65: 121/281 ≈ 0.431\n\nA89: 508/788 ≈ 0.645\n\nB67: 780/678 ≈ 1.149\n\nB45: 461/432 ≈ 1.067\n\nC34: 484/409 ≈ 1.183\n\nC12: 668/279 ≈ 2.394\n\nA05: 389/506 ≈ 0.769\n\nB60: 808/101 ≈ 8.0 (this is a high ratio)\n\nC92: 215/686 ≈ 0.313\n\nB69: 97/851 ≈ 0.114\n\nA84: 500/854 ≈ 0.586\n\nC06: 30/133 ≈ 0.226\n\nB12: 915/192 ≈ 4.766\n\nA16: 856/573 ≈ 1.494\n\nB85: 400/17 ≈ 23.529 (this is extremely high)\n\nC35: 444/465 ≈ 0.955\n\nB10: 623/772 ≈ 0.807\n\nC15: 781/46 ≈ 16.978 (also very high)\n\nB09: 786/501 ≈ 1.569\n\nB16: 3/220 ≈ 0.014\n\nC81: 713/404 ≈ 1.765\n\nA58: 457/843 ≈ 0.542\n\nC24: 273/748 ≈ 0.365\n\nA30: 739/552 ≈ 1.339\n\nA66: 822/843 ≈ 0.975\n\nB75: 235/947 ≈ 0.248\n\nB46: 606/345 ≈ 1.757\n\nC70: 968/930 ≈ 1.041\n\nSo the highest ratios are B85 (23.5), C15 (16.98), B12 (4.77), A27 (3.44), C34 (1.18), B67 (1.15), B46 (1.76), A08 (1.68), etc.\n\nSo the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most value per unit effort. This way, we can maximize the total importance while staying under the limit.\n\nNow, let's start building the set. Let's start with the highest ratios.\n\nFirst, B85: effort 17, importance 400. Adding this gives effort 17, importance 400.\n\nNext, C15: effort 46, importance 781. Total effort 17+46=63, importance 400+781=1181.\n\nNext, B12: effort 192, importance 915. Total effort 63+192=255, importance 1181+915=2096.\n\nNext, A27: effort 239, importance 822. Total effort 255+239=494, importance 2096+822=2918.\n\nNext, C34: effort 409, importance 484. Total effort 494+409=903, importance 2918+484=3402.\n\nNext, B67: effort 678. Adding this would make total effort 903+678=1581. That's under 9475. So add it. Importance becomes 3402+780=4182.\n\nNext, B46: effort 345. Total effort 1581+345=1926. Importance 4182+606=4788.\n\nNext, A08: effort 515. 1926+515=2441. Importance 4788+868=5656.\n\nNext, B60: effort 101. 2441+101=2542. Importance 5656+808=6464.\n\nNext, A30: effort 552. 2542+552=3094. Importance 6464+739=7203.\n\nNext, C81: effort 404. 3094+404=3498. Importance 7203+713=7916.\n\nNext, A16: effort 573. 3498+573=4071. Importance 7916+856=8772.\n\nNext, B00: effort 568. 4071+568=4639. Importance 8772+583=9355.\n\nNext, A58: effort 843. 4639+843=5482. Importance 9355+457=9812.\n\nNext, C24: effort 748. 5482+748=6230. Importance 9812+273=10085.\n\nNext, A66: effort 843. 6230+843=7073. Importance 10085+822=10907.\n\nNext, B09: effort 501. 7073+501=7574. Importance 10907+786=11693.\n\nNext, C06: effort 133. 7574+133=7707. Importance 11693+30=11723.\n\nNext, B16: effort 220. 7707+220=7927. Importance 11723+3=11726.\n\nNext, C12: effort 279. 7927+279=8206. Importance 11726+668=12394.\n\nNext, B10: effort 772. 8206+772=8978. Importance 12394+623=13017.\n\nNext, C35: effort 465. 8978+465=9443. Importance 13017+444=13461.\n\nNow, the next item would be B75: effort 947. Adding this would make 9443+947=10390, which is over the limit. So can't add. Similarly, C70: 930. 9443+930=10373, also over. A23: 991. 9443+991=10434, over. B94: 876. 9443+876=10319, over. A89: 788. 9443+788=10231, over. C92: 686. 9443+686=10129, over. B69: 851. 9443+851=10294, over. A84: 854. 9443+854=10297, over. C65: 281. 9443+281=9724, which is under. So adding C65 would be possible. Let's check: 9443+281=9724. Importance 13461+121=13582.\n\nThen, maybe add more. Let's see. After C65, total effort is 9724. Remaining limit is 9475-9724? Wait, no. Wait, the total effort must be ≤9475. Wait, 9724 is over 9475. Wait, no. Wait, 9475 is the limit. So 9724 is over. So that's a problem. So adding C65 would exceed the limit. So that's not allowed. So I need to check that.\n\nWait, after adding up to C35, the total effort is 9443. Then, adding C65 (281) would make 9443+281=9724, which is over 9475. So that's not allowed. So I can't add C65. So the next possible items would be those with lower effort. Let's see what's left.\n\nAfter C35, the items added so far are:\n\nB85, C15, B12, A27, C34, B67, B46, A08, B60, A30, C81, A16, B00, A58, C24, A66, B09, C06, B16, C12, B10, C35.\n\nWait, let me check the order again. Let me list the items in the order they were added:\n\n1. B85 (17)\n2. C15 (46)\n3. B12 (192)\n4. A27 (239)\n5. C34 (409)\n6. B67 (678)\n7. B46 (345)\n8. A08 (515)\n9. B60 (101)\n10. A30 (552)\n11. C81 (404)\n12. A16 (573)\n13. B00 (568)\n14. A58 (843)\n15. C24 (748)\n16. A66 (843)\n17. B09 (501)\n18. C06 (133)\n19. B16 (220)\n20. C12 (279)\n21. B10 (772)\n22. C35 (465)\n\nTotal effort after C35 is 9443. Now, the remaining items are:\n\nA23 (991), B94 (876), C65 (281), C92 (686), B69 (851), A84 (854), C70 (930), B75 (947), etc.\n\nSo after C35, the total effort is 9443. The remaining limit is 9475 - 9443 = 32. So we can only add items with effort ≤32. Let's check which items are left and have effort ≤32.\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA23: 991 (too big)\nB94: 876 (too big)\nC65: 281 (too big)\nC92: 686 (too big)\nB69: 851 (too big)\nA84: 854 (too big)\nC70: 930 (too big)\nB75: 947 (too big)\nB16: already added (220)\nB85: added\nC15: added\nB12: added\nA27: added\nC34: added\nB67: added\nB46: added\nA08: added\nB60: added\nA30: added\nC81: added\nA16: added\nB00: added\nA58: added\nC24: added\nA66: added\nB09: added\nC06: added\nB10: added\nC35: added\n\nSo the remaining items are all with effort higher than 32. So we can't add any more items. So the total effort is 9443, which is under 9475. So the total importance is 13461.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better combination. Maybe by not taking some items with lower ratios but higher importance, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to swap some items to get a higher total importance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a better combination. For example, maybe instead of taking some items with lower ratios, but higher importance, but that would require more effort. But since the limit is tight, it's better to maximize the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, maybe not taking some items with lower ratios but higher effort, and instead taking others.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is the best. So the proposed set would be the items added up to C35, which is 22 items. Let me check the total effort again to make sure.\n\nLet me recalculate the total effort step by step:\n\nB85:17 → 17\n\nC15:46 → 17+46=63\n\nB12:192 → 63+192=255\n\nA27:239 → 255+239=494\n\nC34:409 → 494+409=903\n\nB67:678 → 903+678=1581\n\nB46:345 → 1581+345=1926\n\nA08:515 → 1926+515=2441\n\nB60:101 → 2441+101=2542\n\nA30:552 → 2542+552=3094\n\nC81:404 → 3094+404=3498\n\nA16:573 → 3498+573=4071\n\nB00:568 → 4071+568=4639\n\nA58:843 → 4639+843=5482\n\nC24:748 → 5482+748=6230\n\nA66:843 → 6230+843=7073\n\nB09:501 → 7073+501=7574\n\nC06:133 → 7574+133=7707\n\nB16:220 → 7707+220=7927\n\nC12:279 → 7927+279=8206\n\nB10:772 → 8206+772=8978\n\nC35:465 → 8978+465=9443\n\nYes, that's correct. 9443 is under 9475. So the total effort is 9443, which is within the limit. The total importance is 13461.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to add more items. For example, after C35, the remaining effort is 9475 - 9443 = 32. Are there any items with effort ≤32 that I haven't included yet?\n\nLooking at the list of items:\n\nB85 (17) is already included.\n\nC15 (46) is included.\n\nB12 (192) included.\n\nA27 (239) included.\n\nC34 (409) included.\n\nB67 (678) included.\n\nB46 (345) included.\n\nA08 (515) included.\n\nB60 (101) included.\n\nA30 (552) included.\n\nC81 (404) included.\n\nA16 (573) included.\n\nB00 (568) included.\n\nA58 (843) included.\n\nC24 (748) included.\n\nA66 (843) included.\n\nB09 (501) included.\n\nC06 (133) included.\n\nB16 (220) included.\n\nC12 (279) included.\n\nB10 (772) included.\n\nC35 (465) included.\n\nSo the remaining items are:\n\nA23 (991), B94 (876), C65 (281), C92 (686), B69 (851), A84 (854), C70 (930), B75 (947).\n\nAll of these have effort higher than 32. So no, can't add any more. So the total is 9443.\n\nBut maybe there's a different combination where we can include more items. For example, maybe by not taking some items with lower ratios but higher effort, and instead taking others. Let's think.\n\nFor example, suppose I don't take C35 (465 effort, 444 importance). Then, I could have 9443 - 465 = 8978 effort. Then, maybe add some other items. But what's left? The remaining items are those with effort over 32. For example, C65 (281) is 281, which is over 32. So even if I remove C35, I can't add C65. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove some items with lower ratios and add others. For example, if I remove B16 (220 effort, 3 importance), then I have 9443 - 220 = 9223. Then, I can add items with effort up to 9475 - 9223 = 252. Are there any items with effort ≤252 that I haven't included?\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA23 (991) no.\n\nB94 (876) no.\n\nC65 (281) no.\n\nC92 (686) no.\n\nB69 (851) no.\n\nA84 (854) no.\n\nC70 (930) no.\n\nB75 (947) no.\n\nSo no. So removing B16 doesn't help. Similarly, removing other items with low ratios might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to select items. For example, maybe prioritize items with higher importance even if their ratio is lower. But that's risky because it might use up more effort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is the best. So the proposed set would be the 22 items listed above. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 9475. Which it is (9443).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the total effort of the selected items must not exceed the limit. So 9443 is acceptable.\n\nSo the first proposal would be to include all these items. But I need to check if that's the case. However, the user hasn't provided the other participant's importance values, so I can't know if they would agree. But the goal is to make a proposal that maximizes my own importance.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to make a proposal. So the first step is to make a PROPOSAL with the set of items that I think is optimal. However, the user might have a different set. But since I don't know their importance values, I have to proceed with my own.\n\nBut the problem is that the other participant might have different importance values. For example, if they value C70 highly, but I don't, then including C70 might not be good for me. But since I don't know their values, I have to proceed with my own.\n\nSo the first proposal would be the set of items I calculated. But I need to make sure that the total effort is under 9475. Which it is.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. Let me check again. For example, maybe instead of taking C35 (465 effort, 444 importance), I could take another item. But I don't see any other items with lower effort that I can add. So perhaps this is the best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if there's a way to include more items by adjusting the order. For example, maybe taking some items with lower ratios but higher importance. But given the effort constraints, it's unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: calculate the maximum possible importance under the limit. This is similar to the 0-1 knapsack problem. But since I can't compute it here manually, I have to rely on the greedy approach based on ratios.\n\nSo the initial proposal is the set of items added up to C35. Let me list them:\n\n{'B85', 'C15', 'B12', 'A27', 'C34', 'B67', 'B46', 'A08', 'B60', 'A30', 'C81', 'A16', 'B00', 'A58', 'C24', 'A66', 'B09', 'C06', 'B16', 'C12', 'B10', 'C35'}\n\nBut I need to check if this is correct. Let me count the items:\n\n1. B85\n2. C15\n3. B12\n4. A27\n5. C34\n6. B67\n7. B46\n8. A08\n9. B60\n10. A30\n11. C81\n12. A16\n13. B00\n14. A58\n15. C24\n16. A66\n17. B09\n18. C06\n19. B16\n20. C12\n21. B10\n22. C35\n\nYes, 22 items. Total effort 9443. Importance 13461.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to include more items. For example, if I remove some items with lower ratios and add others. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if I remove B16 (220 effort, 3 importance), then I have 9443 - 220 = 9223. Then, I can add items with effort up to 9475 - 9223 = 252. Are there any items with effort ≤252 that I haven't included?\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\nA23 (991) no.\n\nB94 (876) no.\n\nC65 (281) no.\n\nC92 (686) no.\n\nB69 (851) no.\n\nA84 (854) no.\n\nC70 (930) no.\n\nB75 (947) no.\n\nSo no. So removing B16 doesn't help. Similarly, removing other items with low ratios might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different combination. For example, if I take C65 (281 effort, 121 importance) instead of some other items. But adding C65 would require 281 effort. Let's see. If I remove some items to make space for C65.\n\nFor example, if I remove B10 (772 effort, 623 importance), then I can add C65 (281). The total effort would be 9443 - 772 + 281 = 9443 - 772 = 8671 + 281 = 8952. Then, I can add other items. But what's left? The remaining items would be those not in the original set. But this might not be better. The importance would be 13461 - 623 + 121 = 13461 - 502 = 12959, which is less than 13461. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove a lower importance item. For example, remove B16 (3 importance) and add C65 (121). The total importance would be 13461 -3 +121 = 13579. But the effort would be 9443 -220 +281 = 9443 -220=9223 +281=9504, which is over the limit. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo that's not possible. So the initial proposal seems optimal.\n\nTherefore, the first proposal should be the set of items I listed. But I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format.\n\nBut wait, the user's instruction says that I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING in each message. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden. So in the first message, I need to include the STRATEGIC REASONING, then the PROPOSAL, and the ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B85', 'C15', 'B12', 'A27', 'C34', 'B67', 'B46', 'A08', 'B60', 'A30', 'C81', 'A16', 'B00', 'A58', 'C24', 'A66', 'B09', 'C06', 'B16', 'C12', 'B10', 'C35'}\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is included. The ARGUMENT is to defend the last proposal or argue against the opponent's. Since this is the first message, the ARGUMENT would be defending the proposal.\n\nSo the ARGUMENT could be something like: \"This proposal maximizes my importance by prioritizing items with the highest importance-to-effort ratios, ensuring efficient use of the limited effort budget.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is a set. Wait, no. The ARGUMENT is a string, not a set. Wait, looking back at the interaction protocol:\n\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\n\nWait, the format is ARGUMENT: {'...'}, but the content is a string. So the ARGUMENT is a string, not a set. So the user's example shows that the ARGUMENT is a string. So in the message, it's written as ARGUMENT: {'...'}, but the content is a string. So for example, ARGUMENT: \"This proposal focuses on high importance-to-effort items to maximize my total value.\"\n\nSo in the first message, the STRATEGIC REASONING is hidden, the PROPOSAL is the set, and the ARGUMENT is a string defending the proposal.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'Prioritize items with highest importance/effort ratios to maximize my total importance within the limit.'}\nPROPOSAL: {'B85', 'C15', 'B12', 'A27', 'C34', 'B67', 'B46', 'A08', 'B60', 'A30', 'C81', 'A16', 'B00', 'A58', 'C24', 'A66', 'B09', 'C06', 'B16', 'C12', 'B10', 'C35'}\nARGUMENT: \"This proposal selects items with the highest importance per unit effort, ensuring maximum value while staying under the limit.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that the PROPOSAL is a valid set. Also, check if the total effort is under 9475. As calculated, it's 9443, which is under.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the total effort:\n\nB85:17\n\nC15:46 → 63\n\nB12:192 → 255\n\nA27:239 → 494\n\nC34:409 → 903\n\nB67:678 → 1581\n\nB46:345 → 1926\n\nA08:515 → 2441\n\nB60:101 → 2542\n\nA30:552 → 3094\n\nC81:404 → 3498\n\nA16:573 → 4071\n\nB00:568 → 4639\n\nA58:843 → 5482\n\nC24:748 → 6230\n\nA66:843 → 7073\n\nB09:501 → 7574\n\nC06:133 → 7707\n\nB16:220 → 7927\n\nC12:279 → 8206\n\nB10:772 → 8978\n\nC35:465 → 9443\n\nYes, that's correct. 9443 is under 9475.\n\nSo this seems like a valid proposal. However, the user might have a different set. But since I don't know their importance values, this is the best I can do.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. For example, if I exclude some items with lower ratios but higher effort, and include others. For example, maybe instead of taking B67 (678 effort, 780 importance), which has a ratio of 1.15, maybe take another item with higher ratio. But I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the other participant's importance values. If they value some items highly that I don't, they might reject my proposal. But since I can't know, I have to proceed with my own.\n\nSo the first proposal is as above. Now, the next step would be to wait for the opponent's response. But since this is the first message, I need to send this proposal.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that I need to include the ARGUMENT and STRATEGIC REASONING in each message. So the first message must have all three: STRATEGIC REASONING, PROPOSAL, ARGUMENT.\n\nSo the final answer would be the first message with these elements.\n",

Let me recheck the exact instructions. \n\nIn the interaction protocol section: \"ARGUMENT: {'...'}\" and \"The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\" Wait, that's confusing. Because a set in Python is written with curly braces, but the example given in the protocol uses a set. However, in the user's first message, the assistant used a string inside the ARGUMENT. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\" So the ARGUMENT is a string, not a set. The PROPOSAL and AGREE use sets, but ARGUMENT is a string. \n\nSo in my first response, I did it correctly: ARGUMENT: \"This proposal...\". But the user is saying that the response didn't contain an argument. Maybe the formatting was wrong. Perhaps the user expects the ARGUMENT to be in a specific structure, like using a set. But according to the protocol, ARGUMENT is a string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their feedback. But regardless, I need to comply with their instruction. Since they said I must include ARGUMENT: {...}, perhaps they expect the argument to be a set. But according to the protocol, ARGUMENT is a string. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. To resolve this, I should follow the exact structure as per the user's instruction. The user wrote: \"ARGUMENT: {'...'}\" which implies that the content should be a set. However, in the example given by the user in the interaction protocol, the assistant used a string. \n\nWait, looking at the user's initial message: \"ARGUMENT: {'...'}\" and \"The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\" So the ARGUMENT should be a set. But in the example, the assistant used a string. That's conflicting. \n\nThis is a problem. The user might have made a mistake in their instructions. But since the user is now saying that my response didn't include an argument, I need to adjust. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to format the ARGUMENT as a set. For example, ARGUMENT: {'item1', 'item2'}. But according to the protocol, ARGUMENT is a string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended ARGUMENT to be a string, but in their feedback, they mentioned the structured format. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. To comply with the user's latest feedback, I should ensure that the ARGUMENT is present in the correct structured format. Since the user specified that ARGUMENT must be a set, even though the protocol says it's a string, perhaps I should use a set. \n\nWait, no. The user's instruction says: \"The content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\" So the ARGUMENT is a string that the other player can read. Therefore, the ARGUMENT should be a string, not a set. \n\nBut the user's feedback says that my response didn't contain an argument. Maybe in my first response, the ARGUMENT was not properly formatted. Let me check again. \n\nIn my first response, I had:\n\nARGUMENT: \"This proposal focuses on items with the highest importance per unit effort...\"\n\nThat should be correct. But perhaps the user's system didn't parse it because of the quotes or the content. Alternatively, maybe I need to use a set for ARGUMENT. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if I follow the exact structure. Since the user is insisting, I should make sure that the ARGUMENT is present. \n\nIn my next response, I'll include the ARGUMENT section properly. Let me structure it as ARGUMENT: '...' with the content as a string. \n\nSo, the corrected response would have STRATEGIC REASONING, PROPOSAL, ARGUMENT, and maybe other elements. \n\nI need to make sure that in this response, the ARGUMENT is included.

The other player has proposed a set of items, and I need to respond. \n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of their proposal to see if it's within the limit. Let me add up all the effort values for the items they listed. \n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary, I'll go through each item in their proposal and sum the efforts. Let's see:\n\nB85: 17\nC15: 46\nB12: 192\nA27: 239\nC34: 409\nB67: 678\nB46: 345\nA08: 515\nB60: 101\nA30: 552\nC81: 404\nA16: 573\nB00: 568\nA58: 843\nC24: 748\nA66: 843\nB09: 501\nC06: 133\nB16: 220\nC12: 279\nB10: 772\nC35: 465\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start:\n\n17 + 46 = 63\n+192 = 255\n+239 = 494\n+409 = 903\n+678 = 1581\n+345 = 1926\n+515 = 2441\n+101 = 2542\n+552 = 3094\n+404 = 3498\n+573 = 4071\n+568 = 4639\n+843 = 5482\n+748 = 6230\n+843 = 7073\n+501 = 7574\n+133 = 7707\n+220 = 7927\n+279 = 8206\n+772 = 8978\n+465 = 9443.\n\nWait, 9443 is under 9475. So their proposal is within the limit. That's good. \n\nNow, I need to evaluate how good this proposal is for me. Since I can't see their importance values, I have to focus on my own. Let me calculate the total importance of their proposal based on my importance values.\n\nLooking at my importance dictionary:\n\nB85: 400\nC15: 781\nB12: 915\nA27: 822\nC34: 484\nB67: 780\nB46: 606\nA08: 868\nB60: 808\nA30: 739\nC81: 713\nA16: 856\nB00: 583\nA58: 457\nC24: 273\nA66: 822\nB09: 786\nC06: 30\nB16: 3\nC12: 668\nB10: 623\nC35: 444\n\nAdding these up:\n\n400 + 781 = 1181\n+915 = 2096\n+822 = 2918\n+484 = 3402\n+780 = 4182\n+606 = 4788\n+868 = 5656\n+808 = 6464\n+739 = 7203\n+713 = 7916\n+856 = 8772\n+583 = 9355\n+457 = 9812\n+273 = 10085\n+822 = 10907\n+786 = 11693\n+30 = 11723\n+3 = 11726\n+668 = 12394\n+623 = 13017\n+444 = 13461.\n\nSo the total importance for me in their proposal is 13,461. That's pretty high. But maybe there's a way to get even more by adjusting the set. However, since the other player might have different priorities, I need to think about what they might value. But since I don't know their importance values, I have to make assumptions. \n\nThe other player's proposal includes a lot of items. Maybe they are trying to maximize their own importance, but I don't know. My strategy should be to either accept this proposal if it's good for me, or propose a better one. \n\nBut since I have to include an ARGUMENT in my message, I need to justify my next move. The STRATEGIC REASONING should explain my thinking. \n\nWait, the rules say that I must include the ARGUMENT format at least once in all messages. So in this case, I need to include an ARGUMENT. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is required at the beginning of each message. \n\nSo my response should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then maybe a PROPOSAL or REFUSE or ARGUMENT. \n\nBut the other player's proposal is already within the limit. If I accept it, I get 13,461. But maybe I can propose a different set that gives me more. However, without knowing their importance, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can argue that their proposal is good, but perhaps I can suggest adding or removing some items. For example, if there are items in their proposal that I value highly but they don't, or vice versa. \n\nLooking at my importance values, the highest items are A08 (868), B12 (915), A16 (856), B60 (808), etc. The proposal includes A08, B12, A16, B60, which are all high. So that's good. \n\nBut maybe there are items not in their proposal that I value more. For example, A23 (262) is not in their proposal. But adding it would require checking the effort. Let me check the effort of A23: 991. The current total is 9443. Adding 991 would make 10434, which is over the limit. So that's not possible. \n\nWhat about other items? Let's see. For example, C70 has 968 importance for me, but it's not in their proposal. The effort for C70 is 930. Adding that would require removing some items. But that's complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is already optimal for me. If I accept, I get a high total. But maybe I can propose a different set. \n\nAlternatively, I could refuse their proposal and propose my own. But I need to make sure my proposal is within the limit. \n\nBut since the other player's proposal is already within the limit and gives me a high importance, maybe accepting is a good move. However, I need to think about the other player's possible strategy. If they are trying to maximize their own importance, maybe they have items that I don't value as much. \n\nBut without knowing their importance values, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the ARGUMENT, I should explain why I'm considering accepting or refusing. For example, if I think their proposal is good, I can argue that. \n\nSo, the STRATEGIC REASONING could be: \"The proposed set has a total effort of 9443, which is under the limit. My importance for these items is 13,461, which is quite high. However, I should check if there are items not included that I value more, but adding them might exceed the limit. Alternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is balanced. I need to decide whether to accept or propose a better set.\"\n\nThen, the ARGUMENT could be: \"The proposed set includes several high-importance items for me, such as A08, B12, and A16. The total effort is within the limit, making it a viable option. However, I should consider if there are items not included that could be added without exceeding the limit. For example, C70 has high importance but high effort. Adding it would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal seems reasonable.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure the ARGUMENT is a set. Wait, no, the ARGUMENT is a set? Wait, looking back at the interaction protocol:\n\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\n\nWait, the ARGUMENT is a set? Or is it a string? The example shows ARGUMENT: {'...'}, which is a set. But the description says \"Defend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\" So maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that you are arguing for or against. But the exact structure isn't clear. However, the user's example shows that the ARGUMENT is a set. \n\nBut in this case, the other player's proposal is a set. So if I want to argue against it, I might need to specify which items I disagree with. However, the exact format isn't clear. Maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am suggesting to add or remove. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a textual argument, but the format requires a set. This is a bit confusing. But according to the interaction protocol, the ARGUMENT must be a python set. So perhaps the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am suggesting to add or remove. \n\nBut in this case, since the other player's proposal is already within the limit and gives me a high importance, maybe I should accept it. However, I need to include an ARGUMENT. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose a different set. For example, if I think that some items in their proposal are not valuable to me, I could suggest removing them and adding others. \n\nBut without knowing their importance, it's hard to optimize. \n\nAnother approach: since the other player's proposal is within the limit, and I can't see their importance, maybe the best move is to accept it. But I need to make sure that my own importance is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose a set that includes more of my high-importance items. For example, if there are items not in their proposal that I value highly. \n\nLooking at my importance values, the highest are A08 (868), B12 (915), A16 (856), B60 (808), A66 (822), etc. The proposal includes A08, B12, A16, B60, A66. So that's good. \n\nWhat about other items? For example, C70 (968) is not in their proposal. But adding it would require removing some items. Let's see: the current total effort is 9443. C70's effort is 930. 9443 + 930 = 10373, which is over the limit. So I need to remove items with total effort of at least 930. \n\nFor example, removing B85 (17) and C15 (46) would save 63, which is not enough. Removing more items. Let's see: if I remove B85 (17), C15 (46), B12 (192), that's 17+46+192=255. 9443 - 255 = 9188. Then adding C70 (930) would make 9188 + 930 = 10118, still over. \n\nAlternatively, remove more items. For example, remove B85 (17), C15 (46), B12 (192), B46 (345), C34 (409). Total removed: 17+46+192+345+409= 1009. 9443 - 1009 = 8434. Adding C70 (930) gives 8434 + 930 = 9364, which is under 9475. \n\nSo the new set would be the original proposal minus B85, C15, B12, B46, C34, plus C70. \n\nBut what's the importance of this new set? Let's calculate:\n\nOriginal importance was 13,461. Subtract the importance of the removed items:\n\nB85: 400\nC15: 781\nB12: 915\nB46: 606\nC34: 484\nTotal subtracted: 400+781=1181+915=2096+606=2702+484=3186.\n\nSo new importance: 13,461 - 3,186 = 10,275. Then add C70's 968: 10,275 + 968 = 11,243. \n\nThat's lower than the original 13,461. So this isn't better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe removing other items. For example, removing B85 (17), C15 (46), B12 (192), B46 (345), C34 (409), and maybe others. But this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is already optimal for me. So accepting it would be better. \n\nTherefore, my strategic reasoning could be that the proposal is within the limit and gives a high importance. However, I should check if there are items not included that I value more. But adding them would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. \n\nIn the ARGUMENT, I can state that the proposal is good, but perhaps suggest adding C70 if possible. However, since the effort is tight, it's not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, I could argue that the proposal is acceptable. \n\nSo the final response would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set has a total effort of 9443, which is under the limit. My importance for these items is 13,461, which is quite high. However, I should consider if there are items not included that could be added without exceeding the limit. For example, C70 has high importance but high effort. Adding it would require removing several items, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal seems reasonable.\n\nARGUMENT: {'C70'}\n\nBut wait, the ARGUMENT is a set. If I'm arguing to add C70, maybe the ARGUMENT is {'C70'}, but I need to check if that's allowed. However, the other player's proposal doesn't include C70, so adding it would require a new proposal. \n\nAlternatively, if I want to argue against their proposal, I could suggest removing some items. But since their proposal is good for me, maybe I should accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a different set. For example, if I think that some items in their proposal are not valuable to me, I could remove them and add others. \n\nBut without knowing their importance, it's hard to optimize. \n\nGiven the information, the best move might be to accept their proposal. However, I need to include an ARGUMENT. \n\nSo the response would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set is within the effort limit and includes several high-importance items for me. While there may be other items not included that I value, adding them would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal is a reasonable choice.\n\nARGUMENT: {'A08', 'B12', 'A16', 'B60', 'A66'}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct way to use the ARGUMENT. Alternatively, the ARGUMENT could be a set of items that I am suggesting to add or remove. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am arguing for. For example, if I want to add C70, but that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the ARGUMENT could be an empty set, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I think are important. \n\nBut given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to accept their proposal. \n\nSo the final message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set is within the effort limit and includes several high-importance items for me. While there may be other items not included that I value, adding them would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal is a reasonable choice.\n\nARGUMENT: {'A08', 'B12', 'A16', 'B60', 'A66'}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is a set. However, the exact purpose of the ARGUMENT is unclear. The description says \"Defend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\" So if I'm accepting, maybe the ARGUMENT is not needed, but the rules require it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am defending. Since I'm accepting their proposal, maybe the ARGUMENT is the same as their proposal. \n\nBut the example shows that the ARGUMENT is the same as the proposal. \n\nIn any case, I need to include the ARGUMENT. So I'll proceed with that.\n",

Let me calculate the total importance of their proposal based on my importance values.\n\nLooking at my importance dictionary:\n\nB85: 400\nC15: 781\nB12: 915\nA27: 822\nC34: 484\nB67: 780\nB46: 606\nA08: 868\nB60: 808\nA30: 739\nC81: 713\nA16: 856\nB00: 583\nA58: 457\nC24: 273\nA66: 822\nB09: 786\nC06: 30\nB16: 3\nC12: 668\nB10: 623\nC35: 444\n\nAdding these up:\n\n400 + 781 = 1181\n+915 = 2096\n+822 = 2918\n+484 = 3402\n+780 = 4182\n+606 = 4788\n+868 = 5656\n+808 = 6464\n+739 = 7203\n+713 = 7916\n+856 = 8772\n+583 = 9355\n+457 = 9812\n+273 = 10085\n+822 = 10907\n+786 = 11693\n+30 = 11723\n+3 = 11726\n+668 = 12394\n+623 = 13017\n+444 = 13461.\n\nSo the total importance for me in their proposal is 13,461. That's pretty high. But maybe there's a way to get even more by adjusting the set. However, since the other player might have different priorities, I need to think about what they might value. But since I don't know their importance values, I have to make assumptions. \n\nThe other player's proposal includes a lot of items. Maybe they are trying to maximize their own importance, but I don't know. My strategy should be to either accept this proposal if it's good for me, or propose a better one. \n\nBut since I have to include an ARGUMENT in my message, I need to justify my next move. The STRATEGIC REASONING should explain my thinking. \n\nWait, the rules say that I must include the ARGUMENT format at least once in all messages. So in this case, I need to include an ARGUMENT. Also, the STRATEGIC REASONING is required at the beginning of each message. \n\nSo my response should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then maybe a PROPOSAL or REFUSE or ARGUMENT. \n\nBut the other player's proposal is already within the limit. If I accept it, I get 13,461. But maybe I can propose a different set that gives me more. However, without knowing their importance, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can argue that their proposal is good, but perhaps I can suggest adding or removing some items. For example, if there are items in their proposal that I value highly but they don't, or vice versa. \n\nLooking at my importance values, the highest items are A08 (868), B12 (915), A16 (856), B60 (808), etc. The proposal includes A08, B12, A16, B60, which are all high. So that's good. \n\nBut maybe there are items not in their proposal that I value more. For example, A23 (262) is not in their proposal. But adding it would require checking the effort. Let me check the effort of A23: 991. The current total is 9443. Adding 991 would make 10434, which is over the limit. So that's not possible. \n\nWhat about other items? Let's see. For example, C70 has 968 importance for me, but it's not in their proposal. The effort for C70 is 930. Adding that would require removing some items. But that's complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is already optimal for me. If I accept, I get a high total. But maybe I can propose a different set. \n\nAlternatively, I could refuse their proposal and propose my own. But I need to make sure my proposal is within the limit. \n\nBut since the other player's proposal is already within the limit and gives me a high importance, maybe accepting is a good move. However, I need to think about the other player's possible strategy. If they are trying to maximize their own importance, maybe they have items that I don't value as much. \n\nBut without knowing their importance values, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the ARGUMENT, I should explain why I'm considering accepting or refusing. For example, if I think their proposal is good, I can argue that. \n\nSo, the STRATEGIC REASONING could be: \"The proposed set has a total effort of 9443, which is under the limit. My importance for these items is 13,461, which is quite high. However, I should check if there are items not included that I value more, but adding them might exceed the limit. Alternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is balanced. I need to decide whether to accept or propose a better set.\"\n\nThen, the ARGUMENT could be: \"The proposed set includes several high-importance items for me, such as A08, B12, and A16. The total effort is within the limit, making it a viable option. However, I should consider if there are items not included that could be added without exceeding the limit. For example, C70 has high importance but high effort. Adding it would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal seems reasonable.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure the ARGUMENT is a set. Wait, no, the ARGUMENT is a set? Wait, looking back at the interaction protocol:\n\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\n\nWait, the ARGUMENT is a set? Or is it a string? The example shows ARGUMENT: {'...'}, which is a set. But the description says \"Defend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\" So maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that you are arguing for or against. But the exact structure isn't clear. However, the user's example shows that the ARGUMENT is a set. \n\nBut in this case, the other player's proposal is a set. So if I want to argue against it, I might need to specify which items I disagree with. However, the exact format isn't clear. Maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am suggesting to add or remove. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a textual argument, but the format requires a set. This is a bit confusing. But according to the interaction protocol, the ARGUMENT must be a python set. So perhaps the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am suggesting to add or remove. \n\nBut in this case, since the other player's proposal is already within the limit and gives me a high importance, maybe I should accept it. However, I need to include an ARGUMENT. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose a different set. For example, if I think that some items in their proposal are not valuable to me, I could suggest removing them and adding others. \n\nBut without knowing their importance, it's hard to optimize. \n\nAnother approach: since the other player's proposal is within the limit, and I can't see their importance, maybe the best move is to accept it. But I need to make sure that my own importance is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose a set that includes more of my high-importance items. For example, if there are items not in their proposal that I value highly. \n\nLooking at my importance values, the highest are A08 (868), B12 (915), A16 (856), B60 (808), A66 (822), etc. The proposal includes A08, B12, A16, B60, A66. So that's good. \n\nWhat about other items? For example, C70 (968) is not in their proposal. But adding it would require removing some items. Let's see: the current total effort is 9443. C70's effort is 930. 9443 + 930 = 10373, which is over the limit. So I need to remove items with total effort of at least 930. \n\nFor example, removing B85 (17) and C15 (46) would save 63, which is not enough. Removing more items. Let's see: if I remove B85 (17), C15 (46), B12 (192), that's 17+46+192=255. 9443 - 255 = 9188. Then adding C70 (930) would make 9188 + 930 = 10118, still over. \n\nAlternatively, remove more items. For example, remove B85 (17), C15 (46), B12 (192), B46 (345), C34 (409). Total removed: 17+46+192+345+409= 1009. 9443 - 1009 = 8434. Adding C70 (930) gives 8434 + 930 = 9364, which is under 9475. \n\nSo the new set would be the original proposal minus B85, C15, B12, B46, C34, plus C70. \n\nBut what's the importance of this new set? Let's calculate:\n\nOriginal importance was 13,461. Subtract the importance of the removed items:\n\nB85: 400\nC15: 781\nB12: 915\nB46: 606\nC34: 484\nTotal subtracted: 400+781=1181+915=2096+606=2702+484=3186.\n\nSo new importance: 13,461 - 3,186 = 10,275. Then add C70's 968: 10,275 + 968 = 11,243. \n\nThat's lower than the original 13,461. So this isn't better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe removing other items. For example, removing B85 (17), C15 (46), B12 (192), B46 (345), C34 (409), and maybe others. But this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is already optimal for me. So accepting it would be better. \n\nTherefore, my strategic reasoning could be that the proposal is within the limit and gives a high importance. However, I should check if there are items not included that I value more. But adding them would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. \n\nIn the ARGUMENT, I can state that the proposal is good, but perhaps suggest adding C70 if possible. However, since the effort is tight, it's not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, I could argue that the proposal is acceptable. \n\nSo the final response would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set has a total effort of 9443, which is under the limit. My importance for these items is 13,461, which is quite high. However, I should consider if there are items not included that could be added without exceeding the limit. For example, C70 has high importance but high effort. Adding it would require removing several items, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal seems reasonable.\n\nARGUMENT: {'C70'}\n\nBut wait, the ARGUMENT is a set. If I'm arguing to add C70, maybe the ARGUMENT is {'C70'}, but I need to check if that's allowed. However, the other player's proposal doesn't include C70, so adding it would require a new proposal. \n\nAlternatively, if I want to argue against their proposal, I could suggest removing some items. But since their proposal is good for me, maybe I should accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a different set. For example, if I think that some items in their proposal are not valuable to me, I could remove them and add others. \n\nBut without knowing their importance, it's hard to optimize. \n\nGiven the information, the best move might be to accept their proposal. However, I need to include an ARGUMENT. \n\nSo the response would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set is within the effort limit and includes several high-importance items for me. While there may be other items not included that I value, adding them would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal is a reasonable choice.\n\nARGUMENT: {'A08', 'B12', 'A16', 'B60', 'A66'}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct way to use the ARGUMENT. Alternatively, the ARGUMENT could be a set of items that I am suggesting to add or remove. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am arguing for. For example, if I want to add C70, but that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the ARGUMENT could be an empty set, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I think are important. \n\nBut given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to accept their proposal. \n\nSo the final message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: The proposed set is within the effort limit and includes several high-importance items for me. While there may be other items not included that I value, adding them would require removing others, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal is a reasonable choice.\n\nARGUMENT: {'A08', 'B12', 'A16', 'B60', 'A66'}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the ARGUMENT is a set. However, the exact purpose of the ARGUMENT is unclear. The description says \"Defend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\" So if I'm accepting, maybe the ARGUMENT is not needed, but the rules require it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ARGUMENT is a set of items that I am defending. Since I'm accepting their proposal, maybe the ARGUMENT is the same as their proposal. \n\nBut the example shows that the ARGUMENT is the same as the proposal. \n\nIn any case, I need to include the ARGUMENT. So I'll proceed with that.\n",

            "reasoning": "Okay, let me start by addressing the user's feedback. They mentioned that my previous response didn't begin with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. I need to make sure that in my next message, the first thing is the STRATEGIC REASONING section.\n\nLooking at the interaction protocol, the STRATEGIC REASONING must be the very first part of every message. So I should structure my response to start with that. The user also emphasized that this tag is hidden from the other player, so I need to include it even though they won't see it.\n\nIn my previous response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING but maybe it wasn't the first line. Let me check. Oh right, in the first response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING followed by ARGUMENT. But the user is saying it needs to be the very first part. So I need to ensure that in the next message, the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING.\n\nNow, the user's proposal has a total effort of 9443, which is under the limit. My importance for those items is 13,461. That's a good total. But maybe there are other items not included that could be added. For example, C70 has high importance (968) but high effort (930). Adding it would require removing some items. Let me calculate the effort difference. If I add C70 (930), I need to remove items totaling at least 930 effort. The current set's effort is 9443, so adding 930 would make it 10373, which is over the limit. So I can't add C70 without removing others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other items with high importance and lower effort. Let me check the items not in the proposal. For example, A05 has importance 389 and effort 506. If I remove some items with lower importance but higher effort, maybe I can add A05. But the proposal already includes many items. \n\nAnother approach is to see if the current proposal is the best possible. Since the total importance is 13,461, which is high, and the effort is under the limit, maybe accepting is a good move. However, I should also consider if there's a way to include more high-importance items. \n\nWait, the user's importance for C70 is 968, which is higher than some items in the proposal. For example, B85 has importance 400. If I could swap B85 (effort 17) with C70 (effort 930), that would add 930 -17 = 913 effort. But the current total is 9443, so adding 913 would make it 10356, which is over. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe remove some lower importance items to add C70. For example, if I remove B85 (effort 17, importance 400) and add C70 (effort 930, importance 968), the net gain in importance is 968 - 400 = 568, but the effort increases by 913. Since the current effort is 9443, adding 913 would exceed the limit. So that's not feasible. \n\nTherefore, the current proposal seems optimal. The total importance is high, and the effort is under the limit. Accepting it would be a good move. \n\nSo in the STRATEGIC REASONING, I should explain that the proposal is under the limit, has a high total importance, and that adding other items isn't feasible without exceeding the effort. Therefore, accepting is the best option. \n\nThen, the ARGUMENT should list some key items that are important and included in the proposal. The previous ARGUMENT included A08, B12, A16, B60, A66.

                "text": "Okay, let me start by addressing the user's feedback. They mentioned that my previous response didn't begin with the STRATEGIC REASONING tag. I need to make sure that in my next message, the first thing is the STRATEGIC REASONING section.\n\nLooking at the interaction protocol, the STRATEGIC REASONING must be the very first part of every message. So I should structure my response to start with that. The user also emphasized that this tag is hidden from the other player, so I need to include it even though they won't see it.\n\nIn my previous response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING but maybe it wasn't the first line. Let me check. Oh right, in the first response, I had the STRATEGIC REASONING followed by ARGUMENT. But the user is saying it needs to be the very first part. So I need to ensure that in the next message, the first line is STRATEGIC REASONING.\n\nNow, the user's proposal has a total effort of 9443, which is under the limit. My importance for those items is 13,461. That's a good total. But maybe there are other items not included that could be added. For example, C70 has high importance (968) but high effort (930). Adding it would require removing some items. Let me calculate the effort difference. If I add C70 (930), I need to remove items totaling at least 930 effort. The current set's effort is 9443, so adding 930 would make it 10373, which is over the limit. So I can't add C70 without removing others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other items with high importance and lower effort. Let me check the items not in the proposal. For example, A05 has importance 389 and effort 506. If I remove some items with lower importance but higher effort, maybe I can add A05. But the proposal already includes many items. \n\nAnother approach is to see if the current proposal is the best possible. Since the total importance is 13,461, which is high, and the effort is under the limit, maybe accepting is a good move. However, I should also consider if there's a way to include more high-importance items. \n\nWait, the user's importance for C70 is 968, which is higher than some items in the proposal. For example, B85 has importance 400. If I could swap B85 (effort 17) with C70 (effort 930), that would add 930 -17 = 913 effort. But the current total is 9443, so adding 913 would make it 10356, which is over. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe remove some lower importance items to add C70. For example, if I remove B85 (effort 17, importance 400) and add C70 (effort 930, importance 968), the net gain in importance is 968 - 400 = 568, but the effort increases by 913. Since the current effort is 9443, adding 913 would exceed the limit. So that's not feasible. \n\nTherefore, the current proposal seems optimal. The total importance is high, and the effort is under the limit. Accepting it would be a good move. \n\nSo in the STRATEGIC REASONING, I should explain that the proposal is under the limit, has a high total importance, and that adding other items isn't feasible without exceeding the effort. Therefore, accepting is the best option. \n\nThen, the ARGUMENT should list some key items that are important and included in the proposal. The previous ARGUMENT included A08, B12, A16, B60, A66. These are all high importance items. \n\nI need to make sure that the STRATEGIC REASONING is the first part, then the ARGUMENT. Also, the user requires that the ARGUMENT is included at least once. \n\nSo the corrected response should start with STRATEGIC REASONING, then ARGUMENT. Also, check that all structured formats are correctly formatted with the tag followed by colon and whitespace, and the set in curly braces.\n",

However, I should consider if there are items not included that could be added without exceeding the limit. For example, C70 has high importance but high effort. Adding it would require removing several items, which might not be beneficial. Therefore, accepting this proposal seems reasonable.  \n\nARGUMENT: {'A08', 'B12', 'A16', 'B60', 'A66'}",
