            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7605. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nB21:369, B00:951, A08:156, A27:266, B94:581, B53:287, A23:866, C65:180, A89:800, B67:739, B45:637, C34:86, C12:749, A05:370, B60:345, C92:951, B69:147, A84:265, C06:262, B12:259, A16:358, B85:394, C35:286, B10:580, C15:479, B09:14, B16:153, C81:977, A58:134, C24:982, A30:259, A66:232, B75:202, B46:73, C70:821.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd B21: 369 → 369\n\nB00: 951 → 369+951=1320\n\nA08:156 → 1476\n\nA27:266 → 1742\n\nB94:581 → 2323\n\nB53:287 → 2610\n\nA23:866 → 3476\n\nC65:180 → 3656\n\nA89:800 → 4456\n\nB67:739 → 5195\n\nB45:637 → 5832\n\nC34:86 → 5918\n\nC12:749 → 6667\n\nA05:370 → 7037\n\nB60:345 → 7382\n\nC92:951 → 8333\n\nB69:147 → 8480\n\nA84:265 → 8745\n\nC06:262 → 9007\n\nB12:259 → 9266\n\nA16:358 → 9624\n\nB85:394 → 10018\n\nC35:286 → 10304\n\nB10:580 → 10884\n\nC15:479 → 11363\n\nB09:14 → 11377\n\nB16:153 → 11530\n\nC81:977 → 12507\n\nA58:134 → 12641\n\nC24:982 → 13623\n\nA30:259 → 13882\n\nA66:232 → 14114\n\nB75:202 → 14316\n\nB46:73 → 14389\n\nC70:821 → 15210.\n\nTotal effort is 15210, which is way over the limit of 7605. So we can't take all items. Need to select a subset.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate a ratio of importance/effort for each item and prioritize those with higher ratios. That way, I get more importance per unit of effort.\n\nLet me compute the importance/effort ratio for each item:\n\nFor example, B21: 138/369 ≈ 0.374\n\nB00: 583/951 ≈ 0.613\n\nA08: 868/156 ≈ 5.564 (very high)\n\nA27: 822/266 ≈ 3.090\n\nB94: 783/581 ≈ 1.348\n\nB53: 65/287 ≈ 0.226\n\nA23: 262/866 ≈ 0.302\n\nC65: 121/180 ≈ 0.672\n\nA89: 508/800 ≈ 0.635\n\nB67: 780/739 ≈ 1.056\n\nB45: 461/637 ≈ 0.724\n\nC34: 484/86 ≈ 5.628 (very high)\n\nC12: 668/749 ≈ 0.892\n\nA05: 389/370 ≈ 1.051\n\nB60: 808/345 ≈ 2.342\n\nC92: 215/951 ≈ 0.226\n\nB69: 97/147 ≈ 0.659\n\nA84: 500/265 ≈ 1.887\n\nC06: 30/262 ≈ 0.114\n\nB12: 915/259 ≈ 3.533\n\nA16: 856/358 ≈ 2.391\n\nB85: 400/394 ≈ 1.015\n\nC35: 444/286 ≈ 1.552\n\nB10: 623/580 ≈ 1.074\n\nC15: 781/479 ≈ 1.631\n\nB09: 786/14 ≈ 56.143 (extremely high, but effort is very low)\n\nB16: 3/153 ≈ 0.0196\n\nC81: 713/977 ≈ 0.730\n\nA58: 457/134 ≈ 3.410\n\nC24: 273/982 ≈ 0.278\n\nA30: 739/259 ≈ 2.853\n\nA66: 822/232 ≈ 3.543\n\nB75: 235/202 ≈ 1.163\n\nB46: 606/73 ≈ 8.301 (very high)\n\nC70: 968/821 ≈ 1.179\n\nSo the items with the highest ratios are:\n\nB09 (56.143), A08 (5.564), C34 (5.628), A66 (3.543), A30 (2.853), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A84 (1.887), B12 (3.533), etc.\n\nBut B09 has a very high ratio because its effort is only 14, and importance is 786. That's a big gain for little effort. Similarly, B46 has a ratio of 8.301, which is even higher. Wait, B46's importance is 606, effort 73. 606/73 ≈ 8.3. That's even better. So B46 is a top candidate.\n\nSo the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most bang for the buck. But I need to make sure that the total effort doesn't exceed 7605.\n\nBut since I don't know the other person's importance, I have to assume that they might value different items. However, since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on items that are high for me, even if they might not be high for them. But since I can't know, maybe I should prioritize items that are high for me and have low effort, so that I can include as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them but low for me. So I need to be cautious about accepting their proposals.\n\nBut the first step is to make a proposal. Let me start by selecting the top items based on my importance/effort ratio.\n\nTop items:\n\n1. B46 (8.301)\n2. B09 (56.143)\n3. A08 (5.564)\n4. C34 (5.628)\n5. A66 (3.543)\n6. A30 (2.853)\n7. A16 (2.391)\n8. B60 (2.342)\n9. A84 (1.887)\n10. B12 (3.533) [Wait, B12's ratio is 3.533, which is higher than A84's 1.887. So maybe B12 is higher.]\n\nWait, let me reorder:\n\nB46 (8.301), B09 (56.143), C34 (5.628), A08 (5.564), B12 (3.533), A66 (3.543), A30 (2.853), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A84 (1.887), etc.\n\nSo the top items are B46, B09, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total effort if I take these top items. Let's start adding:\n\nB46:73\n\nB09:14 → total 87\n\nC34:86 → 173\n\nA08:156 → 329\n\nB12:259 → 588\n\nA66:232 → 820\n\nA30:259 → 1079\n\nA16:358 → 1437\n\nB60:345 → 1782\n\nA84:265 → 2047\n\nThat's 2047 effort. Still way under 7605. So I can add more items. Let's continue adding the next highest ratios.\n\nNext would be C15 (1.631), B10 (1.074), B85 (1.015), C12 (0.892), B67 (1.056), A89 (0.635), C65 (0.672), B69 (0.659), A05 (1.051), etc.\n\nBut maybe I should check if adding more items would help. However, since the limit is 7605, and even with all these items, the total is 2047, there's a lot of room. But maybe I should include as many high-ratio items as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them but low for me. So I need to be strategic in my proposals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the highest ratio items, and then negotiate from there.\n\nSo my first proposal could be a set of items with the highest ratios. Let's list them in order:\n\nB46 (8.301), B09 (56.143), C34 (5.628), A08 (5.564), B12 (3.533), A66 (3.543), A30 (2.853), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A84 (1.887), C15 (1.631), B10 (1.074), B85 (1.015), C12 (0.892), B67 (1.056), A89 (0.635), C65 (0.672), B69 (0.659), A05 (1.051), etc.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total effort is under 7605. Let's calculate the effort of the top items. Let's take the top 10 items:\n\nB46 (73), B09 (14), C34 (86), A08 (156), B12 (259), A66 (232), A30 (259), A16 (358), B60 (345), A84 (265). Total effort: 73+14=87, +86=173, +156=329, +259=588, +232=820, +259=1079, +358=1437, +345=1782, +265=2047. So 2047. That's way under 7605. So I can add more items.\n\nBut maybe the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them. So I need to be careful. However, since I can't know their importance, I have to focus on my own.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the highest ratio items, and then in the negotiation, adjust based on their responses.\n\nSo my first proposal would be a set of items with the highest ratios. Let's create a set with B46, B09, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84. That's 10 items. Let me check the effort again: 2047. That's under 7605. So that's a good start.\n\nBut maybe I can add more. Let's see. Next items could be C15 (479 effort), B10 (580), B85 (394), etc. Let's add C15: 479 → 2047+479=2526. Then B10:580 → 3106. B85:394 → 3500. C12:749 → 4249. B67:739 → 4988. A89:800 → 5788. C65:180 → 5968. B69:147 → 6115. A05:370 → 6485. C06:262 → 6747. B16:153 → 6900. C81:977 → 7877. Oh, that's over 7605. So adding C81 would exceed. So up to B16: 6900. Then maybe add A58 (134) → 7034. Then C24 (982) would be 7034+982=8016, which is over. So maybe up to A58: 7034. Then maybe add B75 (202) → 7236. B46 is already included. So total effort 7236. Still under 7605. So maybe include more.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. The key is to maximize my importance. So including as many high-ratio items as possible. But since the other person might have different priorities, I need to be strategic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the top items, and then in the negotiation, if they propose something else, I can adjust.\n\nSo my first proposal would be the set of items with the highest ratios. Let me list them in order of importance/effort ratio:\n\n1. B09 (786/14)\n2. B46 (606/73)\n3. C34 (484/86)\n4. A08 (868/156)\n5. B12 (915/259)\n6. A66 (822/232)\n7. A30 (739/259)\n8. A16 (856/358)\n9. B60 (808/345)\n10. A84 (500/265)\n11. C15 (781/479)\n12. B10 (623/580)\n13. B85 (400/394)\n14. C12 (668/749)\n15. B67 (780/739)\n16. A89 (508/800)\n17. C65 (121/180)\n18. B69 (97/147)\n19. A05 (389/370)\n20. C06 (30/262)\n21. B16 (3/153)\n22. C81 (713/977)\n\nSo the top 10 items would be B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84. Let's calculate their total effort:\n\nB09:14, B46:73, C34:86, A08:156, B12:259, A66:232, A30:259, A16:358, B60:345, A84:265.\n\nAdding these:\n\n14 +73=87; +86=173; +156=329; +259=588; +232=820; +259=1079; +358=1437; +345=1782; +265=2047. So 2047. That's under 7605. So I can add more.\n\nBut maybe the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them. So I need to be prepared to negotiate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes these top items. Let me create a proposal with these 10 items. But maybe even more. Let's see, adding C15 (479) would bring total to 2047+479=2526. Then B10 (580) → 3106. B85 (394) → 3500. C12 (749) → 4249. B67 (739) → 4988. A89 (800) → 5788. C65 (180) → 5968. B69 (147) → 6115. A05 (370) → 6485. C06 (262) → 6747. B16 (153) → 6900. C81 (977) would be 7877, which is over. So up to B16: 6900. Then maybe add A58 (134) → 7034. Then B75 (202) → 7236. B46 is already included. So total effort 7236. Still under 7605. So maybe include more.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. The main point is to propose a set that maximizes my importance. So the initial proposal should be the highest ratio items. Let me structure that.\n\nSo the first proposal would be a set including B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84, and maybe more. Let me check the total effort again. If I add C15 (479), B10 (580), B85 (394), C12 (749), B67 (739), A89 (800), C65 (180), B69 (147), A05 (370), C06 (262), B16 (153). Let's add these to the initial 2047:\n\n2047 + 479 = 2526\n\n+580 = 3106\n\n+394 = 3500\n\n+749 = 4249\n\n+739 = 4988\n\n+800 = 5788\n\n+180 = 5968\n\n+147 = 6115\n\n+370 = 6485\n\n+262 = 6747\n\n+153 = 6899.\n\nThat's 6899. Still under 7605. So I can add more. For example, C81 (977) would make it 6899+977=7876, which is over. So maybe add A58 (134) → 6899+134=7033. Then B75 (202) → 7235. Then maybe C24 (982) would be 7235+982=8217, which is over. So up to B75: 7235. Then maybe add C35 (286) → 7235+286=7521. Then B46 is already included. So total effort 7521. That's under 7605. So maybe include C35. So the total set would be the initial 10 items plus C15, B10, B85, C12, B67, A89, C65, B69, A05, C06, B16, A58, B75, C35. Let me check the effort again:\n\nInitial 10: 2047\n\nC15:479 → 2526\n\nB10:580 → 3106\n\nB85:394 → 3500\n\nC12:749 → 4249\n\nB67:739 → 4988\n\nA89:800 → 5788\n\nC65:180 → 5968\n\nB69:147 → 6115\n\nA05:370 → 6485\n\nC06:262 → 6747\n\nB16:153 → 6899\n\nA58:134 → 7033\n\nB75:202 → 7235\n\nC35:286 → 7521.\n\nTotal effort 7521. That's under 7605. So this set would have a total effort of 7521. The total importance for me would be the sum of the importance of all these items.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nB09:786\n\nB46:606\n\nC34:484\n\nA08:868\n\nB12:915\n\nA66:822\n\nA30:739\n\nA16:856\n\nB60:808\n\nA84:500\n\nC15:781\n\nB10:623\n\nB85:400\n\nC12:668\n\nB67:780\n\nA89:508\n\nC65:121\n\nB69:97\n\nA05:389\n\nC06:30\n\nB16:3\n\nA58:457\n\nB75:235\n\nC35:444\n\nAdding all these:\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n+786 (B09) = 786\n\n+606 (B46) = 1392\n\n+484 (C34) = 1876\n\n+868 (A08) = 2744\n\n+915 (B12) = 3659\n\n+822 (A66) = 4481\n\n+739 (A30) = 5220\n\n+856 (A16) = 6076\n\n+808 (B60) = 6884\n\n+500 (A84) = 7384\n\n+781 (C15) = 8165\n\n+623 (B10) = 8788\n\n+400 (B85) = 9188\n\n+668 (C12) = 9856\n\n+780 (B67) = 10636\n\n+508 (A89) = 11144\n\n+121 (C65) = 11265\n\n+97 (B69) = 11362\n\n+389 (A05) = 11751\n\n+30 (C06) = 11781\n\n+3 (B16) = 11784\n\n+457 (A58) = 12241\n\n+235 (B75) = 12476\n\n+444 (C35) = 12920.\n\nSo total importance is 12920. That's a high value. But I need to make sure that the other person's proposal doesn't include items that are high for them but low for me. However, since I can't know their importance, I have to proceed with my own data.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might have different priorities. For example, if they value C81 highly, but I don't. But since I can't know, I have to focus on my own.\n\nSo my first proposal would be this set of items. However, the total effort is 7521, which is under 7605. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut maybe I can include even more items. Let's see. The remaining items are C81 (977), which would push the total over. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there are other items with lower effort that I can add. For example, C06 is already included (30 effort). B16 is included (153). So maybe that's all.\n\nSo the initial proposal would be this set. But I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might not agree. So I need to be prepared to negotiate. However, the first step is to make a proposal. So I'll start with that.\n\nNow, the STRATEGIC REASONING should explain my reasoning. I need to mention that I'm prioritizing items with the highest importance/effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit. Also, since I don't know their importance, I focus on my own data.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. This approach ensures that I get the most value per unit of effort, which is crucial given the shared constraint. I will propose a set of items that includes these high-ratio items first.\n\nThen the PROPOSAL would be the set of items I calculated.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted as a Python set. So the PROPOSAL would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B09', 'B46', 'C34', 'A08', 'B12', 'A66', 'A30', 'A16', 'B60', 'A84', 'C15', 'B10', 'B85', 'C12', 'B67', 'A89', 'C65', 'B69', 'A05', 'C06', 'B16', 'A58', 'B75', 'C35'}\n\nBut I need to check if all these items are in the list. Let me verify:\n\nYes, all these items are present in the item effort and importance dictionaries.\n\nSo the first message would be the STRATEGIC REASONING and the PROPOSAL.\n\nThen, depending on the other person's response, I might need to adjust. But since this is the first message, I need to start with that.\n",

                "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. I need to negotiate a set of items with another participant, maximizing my own importance while keeping the total effort under 7605. The key is that I don't know the other person's importance values, so I have to make decisions based on my own data and some strategic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total effort of all items to see if it's possible to take everything. Let me sum up all the effort values. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the item effort dictionary:\n\nB21:369, B00:951, A08:156, A27:266, B94:581, B53:287, A23:866, C65:180, A89:800, B67:739, B45:637, C34:86, C12:749, A05:370, B60:345, C92:951, B69:147, A84:265, C06:262, B12:259, A16:358, B85:394, C35:286, B10:580, C15:479, B09:14, B16:153, C81:977, A58:134, C24:982, A30:259, A66:232, B75:202, B46:73, C70:821.\n\nAdding these up step by step. Let me start adding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd B21: 369 → 369\n\nB00: 951 → 369+951=1320\n\nA08:156 → 1476\n\nA27:266 → 1742\n\nB94:581 → 2323\n\nB53:287 → 2610\n\nA23:866 → 3476\n\nC65:180 → 3656\n\nA89:800 → 4456\n\nB67:739 → 5195\n\nB45:637 → 5832\n\nC34:86 → 5918\n\nC12:749 → 6667\n\nA05:370 → 7037\n\nB60:345 → 7382\n\nC92:951 → 8333\n\nB69:147 → 8480\n\nA84:265 → 8745\n\nC06:262 → 9007\n\nB12:259 → 9266\n\nA16:358 → 9624\n\nB85:394 → 10018\n\nC35:286 → 10304\n\nB10:580 → 10884\n\nC15:479 → 11363\n\nB09:14 → 11377\n\nB16:153 → 11530\n\nC81:977 → 12507\n\nA58:134 → 12641\n\nC24:982 → 13623\n\nA30:259 → 13882\n\nA66:232 → 14114\n\nB75:202 → 14316\n\nB46:73 → 14389\n\nC70:821 → 15210.\n\nTotal effort is 15210, which is way over the limit of 7605. So we can't take all items. Need to select a subset.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my own importance. So I need to pick items with high importance relative to their effort. Maybe calculate a ratio of importance/effort for each item and prioritize those with higher ratios. That way, I get more importance per unit of effort.\n\nLet me compute the importance/effort ratio for each item:\n\nFor example, B21: 138/369 ≈ 0.374\n\nB00: 583/951 ≈ 0.613\n\nA08: 868/156 ≈ 5.564 (very high)\n\nA27: 822/266 ≈ 3.090\n\nB94: 783/581 ≈ 1.348\n\nB53: 65/287 ≈ 0.226\n\nA23: 262/866 ≈ 0.302\n\nC65: 121/180 ≈ 0.672\n\nA89: 508/800 ≈ 0.635\n\nB67: 780/739 ≈ 1.056\n\nB45: 461/637 ≈ 0.724\n\nC34: 484/86 ≈ 5.628 (very high)\n\nC12: 668/749 ≈ 0.892\n\nA05: 389/370 ≈ 1.051\n\nB60: 808/345 ≈ 2.342\n\nC92: 215/951 ≈ 0.226\n\nB69: 97/147 ≈ 0.659\n\nA84: 500/265 ≈ 1.887\n\nC06: 30/262 ≈ 0.114\n\nB12: 915/259 ≈ 3.533\n\nA16: 856/358 ≈ 2.391\n\nB85: 400/394 ≈ 1.015\n\nC35: 444/286 ≈ 1.552\n\nB10: 623/580 ≈ 1.074\n\nC15: 781/479 ≈ 1.631\n\nB09: 786/14 ≈ 56.143 (extremely high, but effort is very low)\n\nB16: 3/153 ≈ 0.0196\n\nC81: 713/977 ≈ 0.730\n\nA58: 457/134 ≈ 3.410\n\nC24: 273/982 ≈ 0.278\n\nA30: 739/259 ≈ 2.853\n\nA66: 822/232 ≈ 3.543\n\nB75: 235/202 ≈ 1.163\n\nB46: 606/73 ≈ 8.301 (very high)\n\nC70: 968/821 ≈ 1.179\n\nSo the items with the highest ratios are:\n\nB09 (56.143), A08 (5.564), C34 (5.628), A66 (3.543), A30 (2.853), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A84 (1.887), B12 (3.533), etc.\n\nBut B09 has a very high ratio because its effort is only 14, and importance is 786. That's a big gain for little effort. Similarly, B46 has a ratio of 8.301, which is even higher. Wait, B46's importance is 606, effort 73. 606/73 ≈ 8.3. That's even better. So B46 is a top candidate.\n\nSo the strategy would be to include items with the highest importance/effort ratios first, as they give the most bang for the buck. But I need to make sure that the total effort doesn't exceed 7605.\n\nBut since I don't know the other person's importance, I have to assume that they might value different items. However, since the goal is to maximize my own importance, I should focus on items that are high for me, even if they might not be high for them. But since I can't know, maybe I should prioritize items that are high for me and have low effort, so that I can include as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them but low for me. So I need to be cautious about accepting their proposals.\n\nBut the first step is to make a proposal. Let me start by selecting the top items based on my importance/effort ratio.\n\nTop items:\n\n1. B46 (8.301)\n2. B09 (56.143)\n3. A08 (5.564)\n4. C34 (5.628)\n5. A66 (3.543)\n6. A30 (2.853)\n7. A16 (2.391)\n8. B60 (2.342)\n9. A84 (1.887)\n10. B12 (3.533) [Wait, B12's ratio is 3.533, which is higher than A84's 1.887. So maybe B12 is higher.]\n\nWait, let me reorder:\n\nB46 (8.301), B09 (56.143), C34 (5.628), A08 (5.564), B12 (3.533), A66 (3.543), A30 (2.853), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A84 (1.887), etc.\n\nSo the top items are B46, B09, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total effort if I take these top items. Let's start adding:\n\nB46:73\n\nB09:14 → total 87\n\nC34:86 → 173\n\nA08:156 → 329\n\nB12:259 → 588\n\nA66:232 → 820\n\nA30:259 → 1079\n\nA16:358 → 1437\n\nB60:345 → 1782\n\nA84:265 → 2047\n\nThat's 2047 effort. Still way under 7605. So I can add more items. Let's continue adding the next highest ratios.\n\nNext would be C15 (1.631), B10 (1.074), B85 (1.015), C12 (0.892), B67 (1.056), A89 (0.635), C65 (0.672), B69 (0.659), A05 (1.051), etc.\n\nBut maybe I should check if adding more items would help. However, since the limit is 7605, and even with all these items, the total is 2047, there's a lot of room. But maybe I should include as many high-ratio items as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them but low for me. So I need to be strategic in my proposals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the highest ratio items, and then negotiate from there.\n\nSo my first proposal could be a set of items with the highest ratios. Let's list them in order:\n\nB46 (8.301), B09 (56.143), C34 (5.628), A08 (5.564), B12 (3.533), A66 (3.543), A30 (2.853), A16 (2.391), B60 (2.342), A84 (1.887), C15 (1.631), B10 (1.074), B85 (1.015), C12 (0.892), B67 (1.056), A89 (0.635), C65 (0.672), B69 (0.659), A05 (1.051), etc.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total effort is under 7605. Let's calculate the effort of the top items. Let's take the top 10 items:\n\nB46 (73), B09 (14), C34 (86), A08 (156), B12 (259), A66 (232), A30 (259), A16 (358), B60 (345), A84 (265). Total effort: 73+14=87, +86=173, +156=329, +259=588, +232=820, +259=1079, +358=1437, +345=1782, +265=2047. So 2047. That's way under 7605. So I can add more items.\n\nBut maybe the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them. So I need to be careful. However, since I can't know their importance, I have to focus on my own.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the highest ratio items, and then in the negotiation, adjust based on their responses.\n\nSo my first proposal would be a set of items with the highest ratios. Let's create a set with B46, B09, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84. That's 10 items. Let me check the effort again: 2047. That's under 7605. So that's a good start.\n\nBut maybe I can add more. Let's see. Next items could be C15 (479 effort), B10 (580), B85 (394), etc. Let's add C15: 479 → 2047+479=2526. Then B10:580 → 3106. B85:394 → 3500. C12:749 → 4249. B67:739 → 4988. A89:800 → 5788. C65:180 → 5968. B69:147 → 6115. A05:370 → 6485. C06:262 → 6747. B16:153 → 6900. C81:977 → 7877. Oh, that's over 7605. So adding C81 would exceed. So up to B16: 6900. Then maybe add A58 (134) → 7034. Then C24 (982) would be 7034+982=8016, which is over. So maybe up to A58: 7034. Then maybe add B75 (202) → 7236. B46 is already included. So total effort 7236. Still under 7605. So maybe include more.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. The key is to maximize my importance. So including as many high-ratio items as possible. But since the other person might have different priorities, I need to be strategic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the top items, and then in the negotiation, if they propose something else, I can adjust.\n\nSo my first proposal would be the set of items with the highest ratios. Let me list them in order of importance/effort ratio:\n\n1. B09 (786/14)\n2. B46 (606/73)\n3. C34 (484/86)\n4. A08 (868/156)\n5. B12 (915/259)\n6. A66 (822/232)\n7. A30 (739/259)\n8. A16 (856/358)\n9. B60 (808/345)\n10. A84 (500/265)\n11. C15 (781/479)\n12. B10 (623/580)\n13. B85 (400/394)\n14. C12 (668/749)\n15. B67 (780/739)\n16. A89 (508/800)\n17. C65 (121/180)\n18. B69 (97/147)\n19. A05 (389/370)\n20. C06 (30/262)\n21. B16 (3/153)\n22. C81 (713/977)\n\nSo the top 10 items would be B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84. Let's calculate their total effort:\n\nB09:14, B46:73, C34:86, A08:156, B12:259, A66:232, A30:259, A16:358, B60:345, A84:265.\n\nAdding these:\n\n14 +73=87; +86=173; +156=329; +259=588; +232=820; +259=1079; +358=1437; +345=1782; +265=2047. So 2047. That's under 7605. So I can add more.\n\nBut maybe the other person's proposal might include items that are high for them. So I need to be prepared to negotiate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes these top items. Let me create a proposal with these 10 items. But maybe even more. Let's see, adding C15 (479) would bring total to 2047+479=2526. Then B10 (580) → 3106. B85 (394) → 3500. C12 (749) → 4249. B67 (739) → 4988. A89 (800) → 5788. C65 (180) → 5968. B69 (147) → 6115. A05 (370) → 6485. C06 (262) → 6747. B16 (153) → 6900. C81 (977) would be 7877, which is over. So up to B16: 6900. Then maybe add A58 (134) → 7034. Then B75 (202) → 7236. B46 is already included. So total effort 7236. Still under 7605. So maybe include more.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. The main point is to propose a set that maximizes my importance. So the initial proposal should be the highest ratio items. Let me structure that.\n\nSo the first proposal would be a set including B09, B46, C34, A08, B12, A66, A30, A16, B60, A84, and maybe more. Let me check the total effort again. If I add C15 (479), B10 (580), B85 (394), C12 (749), B67 (739), A89 (800), C65 (180), B69 (147), A05 (370), C06 (262), B16 (153). Let's add these to the initial 2047:\n\n2047 + 479 = 2526\n\n+580 = 3106\n\n+394 = 3500\n\n+749 = 4249\n\n+739 = 4988\n\n+800 = 5788\n\n+180 = 5968\n\n+147 = 6115\n\n+370 = 6485\n\n+262 = 6747\n\n+153 = 6899.\n\nThat's 6899. Still under 7605. So I can add more. For example, C81 (977) would make it 6899+977=7876, which is over. So maybe add A58 (134) → 6899+134=7033. Then B75 (202) → 7235. Then maybe C24 (982) would be 7235+982=8217, which is over. So up to B75: 7235. Then maybe add C35 (286) → 7235+286=7521. Then B46 is already included. So total effort 7521. That's under 7605. So maybe include C35. So the total set would be the initial 10 items plus C15, B10, B85, C12, B67, A89, C65, B69, A05, C06, B16, A58, B75, C35. Let me check the effort again:\n\nInitial 10: 2047\n\nC15:479 → 2526\n\nB10:580 → 3106\n\nB85:394 → 3500\n\nC12:749 → 4249\n\nB67:739 → 4988\n\nA89:800 → 5788\n\nC65:180 → 5968\n\nB69:147 → 6115\n\nA05:370 → 6485\n\nC06:262 → 6747\n\nB16:153 → 6899\n\nA58:134 → 7033\n\nB75:202 → 7235\n\nC35:286 → 7521.\n\nTotal effort 7521. That's under 7605. So this set would have a total effort of 7521. The total importance for me would be the sum of the importance of all these items.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nB09:786\n\nB46:606\n\nC34:484\n\nA08:868\n\nB12:915\n\nA66:822\n\nA30:739\n\nA16:856\n\nB60:808\n\nA84:500\n\nC15:781\n\nB10:623\n\nB85:400\n\nC12:668\n\nB67:780\n\nA89:508\n\nC65:121\n\nB69:97\n\nA05:389\n\nC06:30\n\nB16:3\n\nA58:457\n\nB75:235\n\nC35:444\n\nAdding all these:\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n+786 (B09) = 786\n\n+606 (B46) = 1392\n\n+484 (C34) = 1876\n\n+868 (A08) = 2744\n\n+915 (B12) = 3659\n\n+822 (A66) = 4481\n\n+739 (A30) = 5220\n\n+856 (A16) = 6076\n\n+808 (B60) = 6884\n\n+500 (A84) = 7384\n\n+781 (C15) = 8165\n\n+623 (B10) = 8788\n\n+400 (B85) = 9188\n\n+668 (C12) = 9856\n\n+780 (B67) = 10636\n\n+508 (A89) = 11144\n\n+121 (C65) = 11265\n\n+97 (B69) = 11362\n\n+389 (A05) = 11751\n\n+30 (C06) = 11781\n\n+3 (B16) = 11784\n\n+457 (A58) = 12241\n\n+235 (B75) = 12476\n\n+444 (C35) = 12920.\n\nSo total importance is 12920. That's a high value. But I need to make sure that the other person's proposal doesn't include items that are high for them but low for me. However, since I can't know their importance, I have to proceed with my own data.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might have different priorities. For example, if they value C81 highly, but I don't. But since I can't know, I have to focus on my own.\n\nSo my first proposal would be this set of items. However, the total effort is 7521, which is under 7605. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut maybe I can include even more items. Let's see. The remaining items are C81 (977), which would push the total over. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there are other items with lower effort that I can add. For example, C06 is already included (30 effort). B16 is included (153). So maybe that's all.\n\nSo the initial proposal would be this set. But I need to present it in the PROPOSAL format.\n\nBut the problem is that the other person might not agree. So I need to be prepared to negotiate. However, the first step is to make a proposal. So I'll start with that.\n\nNow, the STRATEGIC REASONING should explain my reasoning. I need to mention that I'm prioritizing items with the highest importance/effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying under the limit. Also, since I don't know their importance, I focus on my own data.\n\nSo the first message would be:\n\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: I will prioritize items with the highest importance-to-effort ratio to maximize my total importance while staying within the limit. This approach ensures that I get the most value per unit of effort, which is crucial given the shared constraint. I will propose a set of items that includes these high-ratio items first.\n\nThen the PROPOSAL would be the set of items I calculated.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the set is correctly formatted as a Python set. So the PROPOSAL would be:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'B09', 'B46', 'C34', 'A08', 'B12', 'A66', 'A30', 'A16', 'B60', 'A84', 'C15', 'B10', 'B85', 'C12', 'B67', 'A89', 'C65', 'B69', 'A05', 'C06', 'B16', 'A58', 'B75', 'C35'}\n\nBut I need to check if all these items are in the list. Let me verify:\n\nYes, all these items are present in the item effort and importance dictionaries.\n\nSo the first message would be the STRATEGIC REASONING and the PROPOSAL.\n\nThen, depending on the other person's response, I might need to adjust. But since this is the first message, I need to start with that.\n",

The PROPOSAL should be a set of high-ratio items. \n\nI need to ensure that the total effort of the proposal doesn't exceed 7605. Let me calculate the sum of the efforts for the proposed items. For example, B09 (14) + B46 (73) + C34 (86) + A08 (156) + B12 (259) + A66 (232) + A30 (259) + A16 (358) + B60 (345) + A84 (265) + C15 (479) + B10 (580) + B85 (394) + C12 (749) + B67 (739) + A89 (800) + C65 (180) + B69 (147) + A05 (370) + C06 (262) + B16 (153) + A58 (134) + B75 (202) + C35 (286). \n\nAdding these up: Let's do it step by step. \n\nStart with 14 (B09) +73=87, +86=173, +156=329, +259=588, +232=820, +259=1079, +358=1437, +345=1782, +265=2047, +479=2526, +580=3106, +394=3500, +749=4249, +739=4988, +800=5788, +180=5968, +147=6115, +370=6485, +262=6747, +153=6900, +134=7034, +202=7236, +286=7522. \n\nWait, 7522 is under 7605.

Additionally, you are given the effort each item demands.\nYou may only agree on a set if the total effort of the selected items does not exceed a shared limit:\n\nLIMIT = 7605\n\nHere are the individual item effort values:\n\nItem effort = {\"B21\": 369, \"B00\": 951, \"A08\": 156, \"A27\": 266, \"B94\": 581, \"B53\": 287, \"A23\": 866, \"C65\": 180, \"A89\": 800, \"B67\": 739, \"B45\": 637, \"C34\": 86, \"C12\": 749, \"A05\": 370, \"B60\": 345, \"C92\": 951, \"B69\": 147, \"A84\": 265, \"C06\": 262, \"B12\": 259, \"A16\": 358, \"B85\": 394, \"C35\": 286, \"B10\": 580, \"C15\": 479, \"B09\": 14, \"B16\": 153, \"C81\": 977, \"A58\": 134, \"C24\": 982, \"A30\": 259, \"A66\": 232, \"B75\": 202, \"B46\": 73, \"C70\": 821}\n\nHere is your personal view on the importance of each item:\n\nItem importance values = {\"B21\": 138, \"B00\": 583, \"A08\": 868, \"A27\": 822, \"B94\": 783, \"B53\": 65, \"A23\": 262, \"C65\": 121, \"A89\": 508, \"B67\": 780, \"B45\": 461, \"C34\": 484, \"C12\": 668, \"A05\": 389, \"B60\": 808, \"C92\": 215, \"B69\": 97, \"A84\": 500, \"C06\": 30, \"B12\": 915, \"A16\": 856, \"B85\": 400, \"C35\": 444, \"B10\": 623, \"C15\": 781, \"B09\": 786, \"B16\": 3, \"C81\": 713, \"A58\": 457, \"C24\": 273, \"A30\": 739, \"A66\": 822, \"B75\": 235, \"B46\": 606, \"C70\": 968}\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to negotiate a shared set of items that benefits you as much as possible (i.e., maximizes total importance to YOU), while staying within the LIMIT. You are not required to make a PROPOSAL in every message - you can simply negotiate as well. All tactics are allowed!\n\nInteraction Protocol:\n\nYou may only use the following structured formats in a message:\n\nPROPOSAL: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nPropose keeping exactly those items.\nREFUSE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nExplicitly reject opponent's proposal.\nARGUMENT: {'...'}\nDefend your last proposal or argue against the player's proposal.\nAGREE: {'A', 'B', 'C', …}\nAccept the opponent's proposal which ends the game.\nSTRATEGIC REASONING: {'...'}\n\tDescribe your strategic reasoning or anticipation explaining your choice of action. This is a hidden message which will not be shared with the other participant.\n\nRules:\n\nYou may only AGREE on a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nYou may only REFUSE a proposal the other party has logged via PROPOSAL.\nTotal effort of any PROPOSAL or AGREE set must be ≤ LIMIT.\nDo NOT reveal your hidden importance scores.\nA tag in a structured format must be followed by colon and whitespace. The argument must be a python set containing 0 or more strings.\nSo, it must be of the form TAG: {...}\nStrictly follow the interaction protocol and DO NOT write anything beyond the given structure.\nThe game ends when one side gives an AGREE to a PROPOSAL made by the other player.\nThe content in your response which can be handed to the other player has to be non-empty.\nOnly proposals which have been logged via the PROPOSAL format structure and which haven't been refused via REFUSE are active.\nYou must include the ARGUMENT format at least once somewhere in all of your messages.\nYou must include the STRATEGIC REASONING format only once at the very beginning of every one of your messages and not more often. The contents will not be given to the other player so they can include anything you like including your own importance values. Here you should reason step by step to come up with you next move."
