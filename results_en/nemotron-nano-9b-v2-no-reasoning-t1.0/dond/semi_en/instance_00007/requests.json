            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, and 2 cups. My value function is wire:1, glass:0, needle:0, cup:4. So I really value cups a lot, and wires a little. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's complementary to theirs.\n\nThe goal is to maximize my score. Since cups are worth 4 each, I should try to get as many cups as possible. But I can only get up to 2 cups. However, if I take both cups, maybe the other player might not have enough items to make their proposal complementary. Wait, but the other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they'll ask for. Hmm.\n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, even if the other player's proposal is different, there's a chance that together they can cover all items. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should focus on items I value and leave others for them.\n\nWait, but if I take both cups, that's 2 cups. Then the other player might need some items. But if they take, say, both wires and both glasses, then maybe there's enough. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and maybe some wires. Since wires are worth 1 each, but cups are 4 each. So getting both cups would give me 8 points. If I can get both cups, that's better than anything else.\n\nBut how to propose that. The secret proposal format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to send a message with my proposal. Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just send the secret proposal first. But the other player might not have a complementary proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and maybe some other items. But if I take both cups, that's 2 cups. The other player might need to take the rest. But if they take, say, both wires, both glasses, and both needles, then total items would be 2+2+2+2=8, which is all items. So that would be complementary. But if they take some items that I also need, then maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and maybe some wires. But since I value cups more, maybe I should just take both cups. Let me think. If I propose [Proposal: 2 cups], then the other player's proposal would need to take the remaining items. But if they take, say, 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that's 6 items. But the total items are 8. So 2 cups + 6 items = 8. So that would be complementary. But if the other player's proposal is, say, 2 cups and 2 wires, then that's 4 items, and my proposal is 2 cups, which would overlap. So that's not complementary. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be taken by them. Since I value cups, maybe I should take both cups. Then the other player would have to take the rest. But if they take, say, 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that's 6 items. So total 2+6=8. That works. But if they take some cups, then it's a problem. But since I don't know their values, maybe they might not want cups. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and some wires. But if I take 2 cups and 2 wires, that's 4 items. Then the other player would need to take 4 items. But if they take 2 glasses, 2 needles, that's 4. So total 8. That would work. But if they take some cups, then it's a problem. But again, I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and leave the rest for them. But how to structure the proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. But the other player's proposal is also secret. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with theirs.\n\nSince I value cups the most, I should prioritize getting both cups. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 cups]. Then, if the other player's proposal is, say, 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that's 6 items. So total 2+6=8. That's complementary. So I get 2 cups (8 points) and they get 6 items. But if their proposal includes cups, then it's not complementary. But since I don't know their values, maybe they would not want cups. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 cups and 2 wires. That's 4 items. Then the other player would need to take 4 items. If they take 2 glasses and 2 needles, that's 4. So total 8. That works. But if they take some cups, then it's a problem. But again, I don't know.\n\nBut since I can only send one secret proposal, maybe I should go with the safest option. Taking both cups. Because that's the highest value for me. Even if the other player takes some items, as long as they don't take cups, it's okay. But if they do take cups, then it's a problem. But maybe the other player's value function is different. For example, if they value wires more, they might take them. But I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 cups and 2 wires. That way, I get 2 cups (8) and 2 wires (2), total 10. But if the other player's proposal is, say, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that's 4 items. So total 4+4=8. That's complementary. So I get 10. But if their proposal includes cups or wires, then it's not. But again, I don't know.\n\nBut since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the one that maximizes my expected value. Since cups are worth 4 each, getting both is better. So I think the best move is to propose [Proposal: 2 cups]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include cups, I get both. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's value function doesn't value cups as much. For example, if they value wires more, they might take them. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 cups and 2 wires. But that's 4 items. Then the other player would need to take 4 items. If they take 2 glasses and 2 needles, that's 4. So that's good. But if they take 2 cups, then it's a conflict. But again, I don't know.\n\nBut since I can't know their proposal, maybe the best is to take both cups. So I'll go with that. So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 2 cups]. That's the best I can do given my value function.\n",
