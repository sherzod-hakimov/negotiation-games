    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, and 2 cups. My value function is wire:1, glass:0, needle:0, cup:4. So I really value cups a lot, and wires a little. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary to theirs.<br/><br/>The goal is to maximize my score. Since cups are worth 4 each, I should try to get as many cups as possible. But I can only get up to 2 cups. However, if I take both cups, maybe the other player might not have enough items to make their proposal complementary. Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ll ask for. Hmm.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, even if the other player&#x27;s proposal is different, there&#x27;s a chance that together they can cover all items. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should focus on items I value and leave others for them.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take both cups, that&#x27;s 2 cups. Then the other player might need some items. But if they take, say, both wires and both glasses, then maybe there&#x27;s enough. But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and maybe some wires. Since wires are worth 1 each, but cups are 4 each. So getting both cups would give me 8 points. If I can get both cups, that&#x27;s better than anything else.<br/><br/>But how to propose that. The secret proposal format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to send a message with my proposal. Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just send the secret proposal first. But the other player might not have a complementary proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and maybe some other items. But if I take both cups, that&#x27;s 2 cups. The other player might need to take the rest. But if they take, say, both wires, both glasses, and both needles, then total items would be 2+2+2+2=8, which is all items. So that would be complementary. But if they take some items that I also need, then maybe not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and maybe some wires. But since I value cups more, maybe I should just take both cups. Let me think. If I propose [Proposal: 2 cups], then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to take the remaining items. But if they take, say, 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that&#x27;s 6 items. But the total items are 8. So 2 cups + 6 items = 8. So that would be complementary. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 cups and 2 wires, then that&#x27;s 4 items, and my proposal is 2 cups, which would overlap. So that&#x27;s not complementary. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be taken by them. Since I value cups, maybe I should take both cups. Then the other player would have to take the rest. But if they take, say, 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that&#x27;s 6 items. So total 2+6=8. That works. But if they take some cups, then it&#x27;s a problem. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe they might not want cups. But I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and some wires. But if I take 2 cups and 2 wires, that&#x27;s 4 items. Then the other player would need to take 4 items. But if they take 2 glasses, 2 needles, that&#x27;s 4. So total 8. That would work. But if they take some cups, then it&#x27;s a problem. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both cups and leave the rest for them. But how to structure the proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. But the other player&#x27;s proposal is also secret. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with theirs.<br/><br/>Since I value cups the most, I should prioritize getting both cups. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 cups]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that&#x27;s 6 items. So total 2+6=8. That&#x27;s complementary. So I get 2 cups (8 points) and they get 6 items. But if their proposal includes cups, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe they would not want cups. But I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 cups and 2 wires. That&#x27;s 4 items. Then the other player would need to take 4 items. If they take 2 glasses and 2 needles, that&#x27;s 4. So total 8. That works. But if they take some cups, then it&#x27;s a problem. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>But since I can only send one secret proposal, maybe I should go with the safest option. Taking both cups. Because that&#x27;s the highest value for me. Even if the other player takes some items, as long as they don&#x27;t take cups, it&#x27;s okay. But if they do take cups, then it&#x27;s a problem. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is different. For example, if they value wires more, they might take them. But I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 cups and 2 wires. That way, I get 2 cups (8) and 2 wires (2), total 10. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 glasses, 2 needles, then that&#x27;s 4 items. So total 4+4=8. That&#x27;s complementary. So I get 10. But if their proposal includes cups or wires, then it&#x27;s not. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the one that maximizes my expected value. Since cups are worth 4 each, getting both is better. So I think the best move is to propose [Proposal: 2 cups]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include cups, I get both. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function doesn&#x27;t value cups as much. For example, if they value wires more, they might take them. But I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 cups and 2 wires. But that&#x27;s 4 items. Then the other player would need to take 4 items. If they take 2 glasses and 2 needles, that&#x27;s 4. So that&#x27;s good. But if they take 2 cups, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to take both cups. So I&#x27;ll go with that. So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 2 cups]. That&#x27;s the best I can do given my value function.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. The items available are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 needles, 2 cups. My values are wire:1, glass:2, needle:2, cup:0. So I don&#x27;t care about cups at all.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since I have to make my own proposal, I need to think about what to offer. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, which are glasses and needles. But I have to make sure that if their proposal is compatible, we both get points. If not, we both get zero. So I need to propose something that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are in high demand. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should just propose the items I value most. Let me think. If I propose two glasses and two needles, that&#x27;s 4 items. But the other player might have proposed something else. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a combination that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible for me. Since I value glasses and needles, I should propose those. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Since I have 2 glasses and 2 needles, maybe I can propose both. But if the other player also proposes those, then we both get them. But if they proposed something else, maybe we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a subset that&#x27;s likely to be compatible. For example, if I propose 1 glass and 1 needle, that&#x27;s 2 items. But maybe that&#x27;s too little. Or maybe propose 2 glasses and 1 needle. But I need to maximize my own value. Since each glass is worth 2 and needle 2, maybe proposing two glasses and two needles would give me 2*2 + 2*2 = 8 points. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is also 2 glasses and 2 needles, then we both get that. But if they proposed something else, like 2 wires and 2 cups, then we can&#x27;t both get our items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a best guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. For example, if I propose 2 glasses and 2 needles, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is also 2 glasses and 2 needles, then we both get them. But if their proposal is different, maybe we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a different combination. But given that I value glasses and needles, that&#x27;s the best I can do. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>
