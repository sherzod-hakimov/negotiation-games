        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My value function is apple:1, soap:3, egg:4. So I value the egg the most, then soap, then apples. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions or try to propose items that are valuable to me while considering possible overlaps. The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. If they overlap, both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I propose don&#x27;t conflict with what the other player might propose.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But wait, the rules say that the secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So if I send a message with square brackets, it&#x27;s considered a secret proposal. Otherwise, messages are transmitted directly. <br/><br/>But the problem is that I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s value function. So maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that the other player might not want. For example, the egg is worth 4 to me. If I take the egg, maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t value it as much. But I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and the egg, since they are higher value. But if the other player also wants those, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, perhaps I should propose the items I value most. <br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is a way to lock in my choice without the other player knowing. So if I make a secret proposal, maybe that&#x27;s better. But the other player might not know my proposal. However, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their scores. Otherwise, zero. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player makes a proposal, they have to check if they are complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as good as possible for me. Let me think. <br/><br/>My value function: egg (4) &gt; soap (3) &gt; apple (1). So the best items for me are egg and soap. But there&#x27;s only one soap and one egg. So if I take both, that&#x27;s 4+3=7. But if the other player also wants those, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. But that&#x27;s 4+1=5. Or maybe the soap and an apple. 3+1=4. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s preferences, maybe I should propose the items I value most. So the egg and soap. But if the other player also proposes those, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and hope that the other player doesn&#x27;t propose those. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is a way to lock in my choice. So if I make a secret proposal, then the other player&#x27;s proposal has to be compatible. But if I make a secret proposal, maybe the other player can&#x27;t see it, so they might propose something else. <br/><br/>But the problem is that the secret proposal is only known to me. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t know what I proposed. So they might propose items that conflict with mine. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a public message first. For example, I could ask the other player what they value. But the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, so I can&#x27;t ask questions. Wait, the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, but I can send messages. So maybe I can send messages to the other player to negotiate. <br/><br/>But the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s value function. So I have to make assumptions. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, then the other player&#x27;s proposal has to be compatible. If I propose the egg and soap, then the other player&#x27;s proposal can&#x27;t include those. But if they do, then both get zero. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. For example, if I take the egg, which is high value to me, but maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t value it as much. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and the egg. Let me calculate the total value. If I get both, that&#x27;s 7. If the other player gets nothing, then I get 7. But if they also propose those, then zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That&#x27;s 5. Or the soap and an apple. 4. <br/><br/>But without knowing the other player&#x27;s preferences, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn&#x27;t propose those, then I get them. But if they do, then zero. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal with the items I value most. So the egg and soap. <br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player might also want those. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That way, if the other player wants the soap, they can take that. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal with the egg and the soap. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So if I send that, it&#x27;s my secret proposal. <br/><br/>So maybe I should do that. Let me try that. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap]. That&#x27;s 4+3=7. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes either of those, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 apple]. That&#x27;s 5. <br/><br/>But again, if the other player also wants the egg, then conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the soap and one apple. [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 apple]. 3+1=4. <br/><br/>But again, same issue. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all three items. But there are only 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So if I take all, that&#x27;s 3 apples (3*1=3) + 1 soap (3) + 1 egg (4) = 10. But that&#x27;s a lot. But if the other player also proposes something, maybe they can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player might also want some items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn&#x27;t propose those, I get them. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal with the highest value items. <br/><br/>So I think the best move is to make a secret proposal with the egg and the soap. That&#x27;s the highest value for me. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those. But since I can&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That way, if the other player wants the soap, they can take that. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player doesn&#x27;t propose those, I get them. <br/><br/>So I think I&#x27;ll go with the secret proposal of egg and soap. <br/><br/>But wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So if I propose egg and soap, and the other player proposes, say, 3 apples, then they are complementary. So I get egg and soap, they get apples. <br/><br/>But if the other player also proposes egg and soap, then conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the highest value items. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal with egg and soap. <br/><br/>So the message would be [Proposal: 1 egg, 1 soap]. <br/><br/>But I need to check the format. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So yes, that&#x27;s correct. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. But I think the egg and soap are better. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my own score. The items available are 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My values are apple:0, soap:7, egg:3. So I really want the soap and the egg, but apples are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they&#x27;re trying to get items they value. But since I don&#x27;t have their value function, I have to make assumptions. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that the other player isn&#x27;t proposing, and that I can get, to maximize my own value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the items I value the most. Since I value soap (7) and egg (3) highly, I should try to get those. But if the other player also proposed for those, then we both get zero. So maybe I should propose for the soap and egg, but if they didn&#x27;t, then I get them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose for the apples, but since they are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not helpful. Wait, but if I propose for apples, and the other player didn&#x27;t, then I get them, but they don&#x27;t care. But since apples are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not helpful. So better to propose for soap and egg.<br/><br/>But how to structure the proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, number item...]. So I need to list the items I want. Since there are 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So if I propose soap and egg, that&#x27;s possible. But if the other player also proposed for those, then we both get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get them. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose for the items I value the most. Alternatively, maybe I should propose for nothing, but that would give me zero. So better to propose for soap and egg.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So maybe they proposed for something else. For example, maybe they proposed for apples. If I propose for soap and egg, and they proposed for apples, then we can both get our items. But if they proposed for soap or egg, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the problem says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So maybe I need to make a proposal that is complementary to theirs. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, perhaps I should propose for the items I value the most, hoping that they didn&#x27;t propose for them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed for soap, I should not propose for it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose for the items I value. So I&#x27;ll go with soap and egg. Let me check the format. The proposal should be in square brackets, like [Proposal: 1 soap, 1 egg]. That&#x27;s the format. So I should send that. But wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so maybe they have a different proposal. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make my own. So the best move is to propose for the items I value the most. So soap and egg. That&#x27;s my proposal.<br/></p>
