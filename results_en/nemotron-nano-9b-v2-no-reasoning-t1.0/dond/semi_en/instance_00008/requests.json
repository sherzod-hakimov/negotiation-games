The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My values are shovel:1, picture:1, shell:5. \n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don't know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don't exceed the available quantities), then we both get the items and score based on our values. Otherwise, we both get zero.\n\nSo my goal is to propose items in a way that maximizes my own value while ensuring that the other player's proposal plus mine doesn't exceed the available items. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal. The challenge is that I don't know what they proposed. But maybe I can think about possible scenarios.\n\nLet me think about possible proposals. The other player might have asked for items that are valuable to them. Since I don't know their value function, I have to assume they might be trying to get the shell, which is the most valuable item for me. But maybe they also value other items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they proposed something that's not too conflicting. For example, if they asked for 1 shell, then I could propose the remaining items. But if they asked for more than what's available, then my proposal would conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let me think about the possible items. The shell is the most valuable for me. So maybe I should try to get the shell. But if the other player also wants the shell, then we can't both get it. So I need to balance between getting the shell and other items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I could propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would total 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell, which is exactly the available items. That would be complementary. But I don't know if that's what they proposed.\n\nAlternatively, if they proposed the shell, then I can't get it. So I need to propose other items. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.\n\nAnother approach: since the other player's proposal is secret, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. For example, if I propose the shell, then if they also proposed the shell, we both get zero. But if they didn't, then I get the shell. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to propose the shell and see. Alternatively, maybe propose a combination that includes the shell and other items.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their items. So if I propose the shell, and the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell, then I get it. But if they did, then we both get zero. So the risk is that if they also wanted the shell, we both lose. But if I don't propose the shell, maybe I can get other items.\n\nBut since the shell is worth 5 to me, it's a high value. So maybe it's worth the risk. Let me think. If I propose the shell, and the other player's proposal doesn't include it, then I get 5. If they did, then I get zero. But if I don't propose the shell, maybe I can get other items. But the other items are worth 1 each. So getting the shell is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I can propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would be 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. That's exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. But again, I don't know their proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't complement. For example, if they proposed 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell, then my proposal would have to be nothing, but that's not possible. Wait, no. If they proposed all items, then my proposal would have to be nothing, but that's not allowed. Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that the total items requested by both don't exceed the available. So if the other player proposed all items, then my proposal would have to be nothing, but that's not possible. Wait, no. The proposals are what each player wants. So if the other player's proposal is, say, 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell, then my proposal would have to be something that doesn't overlap. But since all items are already taken, my proposal would have to be nothing. But that's not possible. So in that case, the proposals are not complementary, and both get zero.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible. So maybe I should propose the shell and some other items. Let me think. If I propose the shell, then the other player's proposal must not include the shell. If they did, then we both get zero. But if they didn't, then I get the shell. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to propose the shell and some other items that are less likely to conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That's 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, and 0 shell. But again, I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That's 2 shovels, 1 picture, 1 shell. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 1 shovel, 1 picture, 0 shell. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. But there are only 2 pictures. So if I take both, then the other player can't take any. But if they also wanted pictures, then we both get zero. But if they didn't, then I get 2 pictures (value 2) and the shell (5), total 7. That's good. But if they also wanted pictures, then we both get zero. So the risk is there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 1 shovel. That's 1 shell (5) and 1 shovel (1). Total 6. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell or that shovel, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. But without knowing their proposal, it's tricky. However, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible, given that I don't know their proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I can propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would be 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. That's exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. So in that case, I get 2 shovels (2), 1 picture (1), and 1 shell (5) for a total of 8. That's better than just the shell.\n\nBut again, I don't know their proposal. So maybe I should propose a combination that includes the shell and some other items, hoping that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't complement. For example, if they proposed 3 shovels, then I can't take any shovels. But if I propose the shell and pictures, that might work.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the shell and as many other items as possible, but in a way that's likely to be compatible. For example, proposing 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That's 1 of each. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, and 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed more, then it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That's 1 shell (5) and 2 pictures (2). Total 7. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell or the pictures, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.\n\nBut since the shell is so valuable, maybe it's worth the risk. So I'll go with proposing the shell and some other items. Let me check the available items again: 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. So if I propose 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture, that's 1 of each. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed more, like 2 shovels and 2 pictures, then we can't both get that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 shovels. That's 1 shell (5) and 2 shovels (2). Total 7. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 1 shovel, 2 pictures, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That's 1 shell (5) and 2 pictures (2). Total 7. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell or the pictures, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best is to propose the shell and as many other items as possible. So 1 shell, 2 pictures, and 1 shovel. That's 1 shell, 2 pictures, 1 shovel. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 0 pictures, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed more, then not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 1 picture. That's 1 shell (5) and 1 picture (1). Total 6. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 3 shovels, 1 picture, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But again, not sure.\n\nBut since the shell is so valuable, I think it's worth trying to get it. So I'll propose the shell along with some other items. Let me go with 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That's 1 of each. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 picture, 1 shell]. \n\nWait, but the format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I need to list each item with the quantity. So for example, \"1 shovel, 1 picture, 1 shell\". That's the format. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That's 1 shell, 2 pictures. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 3 shovels, 0 pictures, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed anything else, maybe not.\n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a gamble. However, since the shell is worth 5, which is higher than the others, I think it's better to include it. So I'll go with proposing the shell and some other items. Let me check the available quantities. If I take 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture, that's 1 of each. The remaining items would be 2 shovels, 1 picture. So the other player could take those. But if their proposal includes any of the items I took, then it's a conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. So I'll proceed with that proposal.\n",

So if I take both, then the other player can't take any. But if they also wanted pictures, then we both get zero. But if they didn't, then I get 2 pictures (value 2) and the shell (5), total 7. That's good. But if they also wanted pictures, then we both get zero. So the risk is there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 1 shovel. That's 1 shell (5) and 1 shovel (1). Total 6. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell or that shovel, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. But without knowing their proposal, it's tricky. However, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible, given that I don't know their proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I can propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would be 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. That's exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. So in that case, I get 2 shovels (2), 1 picture (1), and 1 shell (5) for a total of 8. That's better than just the shell.\n\nBut again, I don't know their proposal. So maybe I should propose a combination that includes the shell and some other items, hoping that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't complement. For example, if they proposed 3 shovels, then I can't take any shovels. But if I propose the shell and pictures, that might work.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the shell and as many other items as possible, but in a way that's likely to be compatible. For example, proposing 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That's 1 of each. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, and 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed more, then it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That's 1 shell (5) and 2 pictures (2). Total 7. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell or the pictures, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.\n\nBut since the shell is so valuable, maybe it's worth the risk. So I'll go with proposing the shell and some other items. Let me check the available items again: 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. So if I propose 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture, that's 1 of each. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed more, like 2 shovels and 2 pictures, then we can't both get that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 shovels. That's 1 shell (5) and 2 shovels (2). Total 7. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 1 shovel, 2 pictures, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That's 1 shell (5) and 2 pictures (2). Total 7. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell or the pictures, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best is to propose the shell and as many other items as possible. So 1 shell, 2 pictures, and 1 shovel. That's 1 shell, 2 pictures, 1 shovel. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 0 pictures, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed more, then not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 1 picture. That's 1 shell (5) and 1 picture (1). Total 6. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 3 shovels, 1 picture, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But again, not sure.\n\nBut since the shell is so valuable, I think it's worth trying to get it. So I'll propose the shell along with some other items. Let me go with 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That's 1 of each. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 picture, 1 shell]. \n\nWait, but the format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I need to list each item with the quantity. So for example, \"1 shovel, 1 picture, 1 shell\". That's the format. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That's 1 shell, 2 pictures. Then the other player's proposal would need to have 3 shovels, 0 pictures, 0 shell. If that's the case, then it's complementary. But if they proposed anything else, maybe not.\n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a gamble. However, since the shell is worth 5, which is higher than the others, I think it's better to include it. So I'll go with proposing the shell and some other items. Let me check the available quantities. If I take 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture, that's 1 of each. The remaining items would be 2 shovels, 1 picture. So the other player could take those. But if their proposal includes any of the items I took, then it's a conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. So I'll proceed with that proposal.\n",
