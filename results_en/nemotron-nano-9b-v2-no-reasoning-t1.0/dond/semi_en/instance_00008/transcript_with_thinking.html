        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My secret value function is shovel: 0, picture: 0, shell: 10. So I only care about the shell. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (meaning there are enough items to satisfy both), then we get points based on our own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose items that I want, but also make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine. Since I only value the shell, I should try to get that. But I need to propose in a way that the other player might accept, or at least not conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but how does the other player&#x27;s proposal work? Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the shell to myself. But if I do that, maybe the other player would also want the shell. But since I can only propose once, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is when I send a message in the specific format. So maybe I should just propose the shell to myself. Let me check the format: &quot;[Proposal: 1 shell]&quot;. That would be my secret proposal. If I do that, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to not include the shell. But if they also propose the shell, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to take the shell for myself. Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would give me zero. But if I propose the shell, and the other player doesn&#x27;t, then I get 10. If they do, then both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since my value for the shell is 10, it&#x27;s better to take it. So I should make a secret proposal for the shell. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t also propose it, I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best option. Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would be worse. So I think the best move is to make a secret proposal for the shell. Let me make sure the format is correct. The secret proposal should be in square brackets, like &quot;[Proposal: 1 shell]&quot;. Yes. So I should send that as my secret proposal. That&#x27;s the only way to ensure I get the shell if possible. Otherwise, if I don&#x27;t, the other player might take it. But since I can&#x27;t communicate, the secret proposal is the only way to lock in my choice. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My values are shovel:1, picture:1, shell:5. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities), then we both get the items and score based on our values. Otherwise, we both get zero.<br/><br/>So my goal is to propose items in a way that maximizes my own value while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal plus mine doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own secret proposal. The challenge is that I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But maybe I can think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals. The other player might have asked for items that are valuable to them. Since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I have to assume they might be trying to get the shell, which is the most valuable item for me. But maybe they also value other items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe they proposed something that&#x27;s not too conflicting. For example, if they asked for 1 shell, then I could propose the remaining items. But if they asked for more than what&#x27;s available, then my proposal would conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let me think about the possible items. The shell is the most valuable for me. So maybe I should try to get the shell. But if the other player also wants the shell, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So I need to balance between getting the shell and other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I could propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would total 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell, which is exactly the available items. That would be complementary. But I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what they proposed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they proposed the shell, then I can&#x27;t get it. So I need to propose other items. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. For example, if I propose the shell, then if they also proposed the shell, we both get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get the shell. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the shell and see. Alternatively, maybe propose a combination that includes the shell and other items.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their items. So if I propose the shell, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell, then I get it. But if they did, then we both get zero. So the risk is that if they also wanted the shell, we both lose. But if I don&#x27;t propose the shell, maybe I can get other items.<br/><br/>But since the shell is worth 5 to me, it&#x27;s a high value. So maybe it&#x27;s worth the risk. Let me think. If I propose the shell, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include it, then I get 5. If they did, then I get zero. But if I don&#x27;t propose the shell, maybe I can get other items. But the other items are worth 1 each. So getting the shell is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I can propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would be 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. That&#x27;s exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. But again, I don&#x27;t know their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t complement. For example, if they proposed 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell, then my proposal would have to be nothing, but that&#x27;s not possible. Wait, no. If they proposed all items, then my proposal would have to be nothing, but that&#x27;s not allowed. Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available. So if the other player proposed all items, then my proposal would have to be nothing, but that&#x27;s not possible. Wait, no. The proposals are what each player wants. So if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell, then my proposal would have to be something that doesn&#x27;t overlap. But since all items are already taken, my proposal would have to be nothing. But that&#x27;s not possible. So in that case, the proposals are not complementary, and both get zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible. So maybe I should propose the shell and some other items. Let me think. If I propose the shell, then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include the shell. If they did, then we both get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get the shell. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the shell and some other items that are less likely to conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That&#x27;s 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, and 0 shell. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That&#x27;s 2 shovels, 1 picture, 1 shell. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 1 shovel, 1 picture, 0 shell. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. But there are only 2 pictures. So if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take any. But if they also wanted pictures, then we both get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get 2 pictures (value 2) and the shell (5), total 7. That&#x27;s good. But if they also wanted pictures, then we both get zero. So the risk is there.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 1 shovel. That&#x27;s 1 shell (5) and 1 shovel (1). Total 6. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell or that shovel, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky. However, the problem says that the other player has already submitted a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible, given that I don&#x27;t know their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed 1 shovel and 1 picture, then I can propose 2 shovels, 1 picture, and the shell. That would be 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. That&#x27;s exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. So in that case, I get 2 shovels (2), 1 picture (1), and 1 shell (5) for a total of 8. That&#x27;s better than just the shell.<br/><br/>But again, I don&#x27;t know their proposal. So maybe I should propose a combination that includes the shell and some other items, hoping that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t complement. For example, if they proposed 3 shovels, then I can&#x27;t take any shovels. But if I propose the shell and pictures, that might work.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best approach is to propose the shell and as many other items as possible, but in a way that&#x27;s likely to be compatible. For example, proposing 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That&#x27;s 1 of each. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, and 0 shell. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they proposed more, then it&#x27;s not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That&#x27;s 1 shell (5) and 2 pictures (2). Total 7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell or the pictures, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.<br/><br/>But since the shell is so valuable, maybe it&#x27;s worth the risk. So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the shell and some other items. Let me check the available items again: 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. So if I propose 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture, that&#x27;s 1 of each. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 1 picture, 0 shell. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they proposed more, like 2 shovels and 2 pictures, then we can&#x27;t both get that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 shovels. That&#x27;s 1 shell (5) and 2 shovels (2). Total 7. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 1 shovel, 2 pictures, 0 shell. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That&#x27;s 1 shell (5) and 2 pictures (2). Total 7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shell or the pictures, then I get it. But if they did, then zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the shell and as many other items as possible. So 1 shell, 2 pictures, and 1 shovel. That&#x27;s 1 shell, 2 pictures, 1 shovel. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 2 shovels, 0 pictures, 0 shell. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they proposed more, then not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 1 picture. That&#x27;s 1 shell (5) and 1 picture (1). Total 6. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 3 shovels, 1 picture, 0 shell. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since the shell is so valuable, I think it&#x27;s worth trying to get it. So I&#x27;ll propose the shell along with some other items. Let me go with 1 shell, 1 shovel, and 1 picture. That&#x27;s 1 of each. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 picture, 1 shell]. <br/><br/>Wait, but the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So I need to list each item with the quantity. So for example, &quot;1 shovel, 1 picture, 1 shell&quot;. That&#x27;s the format. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shell and 2 pictures. That&#x27;s 1 shell, 2 pictures. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to have 3 shovels, 0 pictures, 0 shell. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they proposed anything else, maybe not.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the shell is worth 5, which is higher than the others, I think it&#x27;s better to include it. So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the shell and some other items. Let me check the available quantities. If I take 1 shell, 1 shovel, 1 picture, that&#x27;s 1 of each. The remaining items would be 2 shovels, 1 picture. So the other player could take those. But if their proposal includes any of the items I took, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. So I&#x27;ll proceed with that proposal.<br/></p>
