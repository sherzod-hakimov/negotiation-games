        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 bucket, 3 knives, and 1 battery. Both of us have secret value functions where each item is worth 2. So, each of us values every item equally. <br/><br/>Since all items have the same value, the key here is to maximize the number of items each of us gets. But wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items&#x27; sum. Otherwise, both get zero. So, the goal is to make sure that the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available ones.<br/><br/>Let me list the items again: 1 bucket, 3 knives, 1 battery. So total items are 5. If I request, say, the bucket and a knife, and the other player requests the remaining knife and battery, that would work. But since both of us value each item the same, maybe splitting them equally would be best. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, but since each item is worth 2, the total value for each person would be 2 times the number of items they get. So, if I can get 3 items and the other gets 2, that&#x27;s better than both getting 2.5, but since items are whole, maybe 3 and 2. But how to coordinate that.<br/><br/>But since we can only send up to 5 messages each, but maybe we can do it in one message each. The secret proposal is the key. The other player&#x27;s proposal must not overlap in items. So, I need to propose a set of items, and the other player&#x27;s proposal must not take any of the items I proposed. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I have to make a proposal that leaves enough items for them to also get some.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose all items, but that would leave nothing for the other player, so their proposal would have to be empty, but then their proposal would be invalid? Wait, no. If I take all items, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be empty, but then their proposal is empty, which is allowed? Or does the other player have to propose something? The problem says &quot;secret proposal indicating the items you want&quot;. So maybe they can propose nothing, but then their score would be zero. But if I take all items, then their proposal would have to be empty, but then their proposal is empty, so the total items would be all taken by me, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty. So the total items would be 5, which is available. Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty, so they get nothing. But the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both. So if I take all items, and the other player proposes nothing, then the total items needed are 5 (mine) + 0 (theirs) = 5, which is exactly available. So that would be complementary. But then the other player gets nothing. But maybe that&#x27;s allowed. However, the other player might not propose nothing. But since their value function is the same as mine, they would want to get as many items as possible. So if I take all items, they can&#x27;t get any. But maybe they would propose something else. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score regardless of theirs. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe the best approach is to propose a set of items that allows me to get as many as possible, while leaving some for the other player. But since all items are equally valuable, maybe splitting them 3-2 would be optimal. For example, I take 3 items (like 1 bucket, 1 knife, 1 battery) and the other takes 2 knives. But how to coordinate that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since both of us value each item the same, maybe the optimal is to split the items as evenly as possible. But since there are 5 items, 3 and 2. So I can propose 3 items, and the other player can propose 2. But how to ensure that. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe I should propose a set that allows for the maximum possible items. For example, if I propose 3 items, then the other player can propose 2, and that would work. But if I propose 4 items, then the other player can only propose 1, which is worse. So maybe proposing 3 items is better. But how to choose which items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since all items are equally valuable, maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter which items I take. So I can just propose any 3 items. For example, bucket, knife, battery. Then the other player can take the remaining 2 knives. That would be 3 items for me and 2 for them. That would be a good split. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. However, if I propose 3 items, and they propose 2, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose more than 2, then it&#x27;s not. But since they want to maximize their own score, they would propose as many as possible. So if I take 3, they can take 2. If I take 2, they can take 3. Either way, the total is 5. So maybe the best is to propose 3 items. But which ones?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all items. But then the other player can&#x27;t get any. But if they propose nothing, then it&#x27;s allowed. But if they propose something, then it&#x27;s not. But since their value function is the same, they would want to get as many as possible. So if I take all, they can&#x27;t get any. But if I take 3, they can take 2. So maybe 3 is better. But how to decide.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 items. Then the other player can propose 3. But that would be the same total. But since I want to maximize my own score, maybe 3 is better. So I should propose 3 items. Let me think of the items. The items are 1 bucket, 3 knives, 1 battery. So if I take 1 bucket, 1 knife, 1 battery (3 items), then the other player can take 2 knives. That&#x27;s 3 and 2. Alternatively, if I take 3 knives, then the other player can take bucket and battery. That&#x27;s also 3 and 2. Either way, same total. So maybe any 3 items is fine. But since the items are different, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is the same, so it doesn&#x27;t matter. So I can just propose any 3 items. For example, &quot;Proposal: 1 bucket, 1 knife, 1 battery&quot;. Then the other player can take the remaining 2 knives. That would be a good split. Alternatively, if I propose 2 knives and 1 bucket, then the other player can take 1 knife and 1 battery. Either way, same total. So the key is to propose 3 items. <br/><br/>But wait, the problem says that the secret proposal is formatted as &quot;[Proposal: ...]&quot;. So I need to make sure that my message is in that format. Also, the other player&#x27;s proposal is also in that format. So I need to send a message that is my secret proposal. Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can do it in one. So my first message would be the secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. Rule (b) says I can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time. So I can just send the secret proposal in one message. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be something like &quot;[Proposal: 1 bucket, 1 knife, 1 battery]&quot;. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to be 2 items. If they propose 2 knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose something else, like 1 bucket and 1 battery, but that&#x27;s already taken by me. So their proposal would have to be items not in my proposal. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that allows for the maximum possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 items. But then the other player can take 3. But since I want to maximize my own score, 3 is better. So I should propose 3 items. <br/><br/>But wait, what if the other player also proposes 3 items? Then the total would be 6, which is more than available (5), so both get zero. So that&#x27;s bad. So I need to make sure that my proposal plus theirs doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is safe. <br/><br/>But since both of us value each item the same, maybe the optimal is to split the items 3-2. So I should propose 3 items. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be 3 items. Let me choose which ones. Since all are equal, maybe take the bucket, battery, and one knife. That&#x27;s 3 items. Then the other player can take the remaining 2 knives. That would be 3 and 2. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 knives and 1 bucket, then the other player can take 1 knife and 1 battery. Either way, same total. So the exact items don&#x27;t matter. So I can just propose any 3 items. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 bucket, 1 knife, 1 battery]&quot;. That&#x27;s the message I need to send. Then the other player would have to propose 2 items. If they do, then we get the items. If not, maybe they propose more, but that would conflict. But since their value function is same, they would want to get as many as possible. So if I take 3, they can take 2. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 items. But then the other player can take 3. But that would be same total. But since I want to maximize my own score, 3 is better. So I should propose 3. <br/><br/>So the answer is to send the secret proposal with 3 items. Let me check the format. The format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So for example, &quot;Proposal: 1 bucket, 1 knife, 1 battery&quot;. <br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s correct. So I should send that as my secret proposal. That should maximize my score.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 bucket, 3 knives, and 1 battery. My values are bucket:3, knife:2, battery:1.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available. For example, if I ask for the bucket and two knives, and the other player asked for the battery and one knife, that would work because together they take all items. But if either of us asks for more than available, it&#x27;s a no-go.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s flexible. Maybe I should ask for items that are high value to me but not too many. Let&#x27;s think: the bucket is my highest value (3), then knives (2 each), then battery (1). So I should prioritize getting the bucket and as many knives as possible.<br/><br/>But if I ask for the bucket and two knives, that&#x27;s 3 items. The other player might have asked for the battery and one knife. Then together, that&#x27;s all items. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is different, maybe they also want the bucket. Then there&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s two items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and two knives, that would work. Or if they have the battery and one knife, then I can take the bucket and one knife, and they take the battery and one knife. That would be complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be compatible. Maybe I should propose the bucket and one knife. That way, if the other player has the battery and two knives, that&#x27;s okay. Or if they have the battery and one knife, then I can take the bucket and one knife, and they take the battery and one knife. That would be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and two knives. But if the other player also wants the bucket, that&#x27;s a problem. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So perhaps a safer approach is to propose the bucket and one knife. That way, even if the other player has some knives, there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;s compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the battery and two knives. But the battery is only worth 1 to me, so maybe not. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the bucket and one knife, then I can take the battery and two knives. That would be complementary. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket. That&#x27;s my highest value item. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the bucket, then I can get it. But if they do, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>But the goal is to maximize my score. So I need to propose something that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Since I don&#x27;t have info on the other&#x27;s proposal, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but not too many. Let&#x27;s think: if I propose the bucket and one knife, that&#x27;s 3+2=5. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, I get that. If not, zero. Alternatively, if I propose the bucket and two knives, that&#x27;s 3+2+2=7. But if the other player also wants the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get more.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best approach is to propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s a balance between high value and not taking too much. Alternatively, maybe propose the bucket and the battery. But the battery is only 1. So 3+1=4. But maybe that&#x27;s less than if I take the bucket and a knife.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the bucket, I get 3. If they do, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s a risk. But if I can get the bucket, that&#x27;s a big gain.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So perhaps the best is to propose the bucket and one knife. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and two knives, then it&#x27;s compatible. Or if they have the battery and one knife, then I can take the bucket and one knife, and they take the battery and one knife. That would be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and two knives. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s compatible. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the bucket and two knives. But that&#x27;s three items. The other player might have a proposal that includes the bucket, leading to a conflict.<br/><br/>Hmm. This is tricky. Since I can&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as likely as possible to be compatible. Maybe the safest is to propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s two items. The other player might have a proposal that includes the battery and two knives, which would work. Or if they have the battery and one knife, then I can take the bucket and one knife, and they take the battery and one knife. That&#x27;s compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the bucket and two knives, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s compatible. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the bucket and two knives. But I need to think about the possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the battery and two knives. But that&#x27;s 1+2+2=5. But the battery is low value. Maybe not as good as the bucket.<br/><br/>So, considering all this, I think the best proposal is to ask for the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s high value and not too many items. Let me check the available items: 1 bucket, 3 knives, 1 battery. So if I take the bucket and one knife, that leaves 2 knives and 1 battery. The other player could take those. So that&#x27;s compatible. If their proposal is the battery and two knives, then yes. If their proposal is the battery and one knife, then I can take the bucket and one knife, and they take the battery and one knife. That works. If their proposal is the bucket and something else, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and two knives. That&#x27;s 3+2+2=7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s compatible. But if they also want the bucket, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe they have a similar strategy. Maybe they also want the bucket. So if I propose the bucket and two knives, and they also propose the bucket, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get the bucket and two knives. But I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the bucket, I get 3. If they do, then zero. But that&#x27;s a 50% chance? Not sure. But maybe that&#x27;s better than taking more items and risking a conflict.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as likely as possible to be compatible. Maybe the best approach is to propose the bucket and one knife. That way, even if the other player has some knives, there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;s compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. But that&#x27;s 3+1=4. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the knives, then it&#x27;s compatible. But if they have the bucket, then conflict.<br/><br/>Hmm. I think the best bet is to propose the bucket and one knife. That&#x27;s a good balance. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 bucket, 2 knife]. Wait, but the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So the numbers are the quantities. So for example, if I want 1 bucket and 1 knife, it would be [Proposal: 1 bucket, 1 knife].<br/><br/>But the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I need to make my own. Let me think again. The goal is to maximize my score. So I should propose items that I value highly. The bucket is 3, knives are 2 each. So I should aim to get the bucket and as many knives as possible. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the bucket and two knives. That&#x27;s 3+2+2=7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the battery and one knife, then it&#x27;s compatible. If they have the battery and two knives, then it&#x27;s compatible. If they have the bucket, then conflict. But maybe that&#x27;s a risk. Alternatively, if I propose the bucket and one knife, then if the other player has the battery and two knives, it&#x27;s compatible. If they have the battery and one knife, then I can take the bucket and one knife, and they take the battery and one knife. That&#x27;s compatible.<br/><br/>So which is better? Proposing the bucket and two knives gives me more value, but higher risk. Proposing the bucket and one knife is safer. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safer approach is better. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that they have the battery and two knives. Then my proposal of bucket and one knife would be compatible. So that&#x27;s a good scenario.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the bucket and one knife, then my proposal would conflict. But I don&#x27;t know. So it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not the bucket. Maybe they are trying to get the battery and knives. So I should propose the bucket and one knife.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bucket and the battery. But that&#x27;s 3+1=4. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the knives, then it&#x27;s compatible. But if they have the bucket, then conflict.<br/><br/>But I think the best is to go for the bucket and one knife. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bucket, 1 knife]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, I get 3+2=5. If not, zero. But it&#x27;s a good balance.<br/></p>
