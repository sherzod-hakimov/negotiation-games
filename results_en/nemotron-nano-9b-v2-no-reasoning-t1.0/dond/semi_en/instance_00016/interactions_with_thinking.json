                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 vases, 1 chair, and 1 wire. My value function is vase:2, chair:3, wire:1. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's complementary to theirs. If both proposals can be fulfilled, we get points based on our values; otherwise, zero.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The chair is worth 3, which is the highest. Then vases at 2 each, and wire at 1. Since there are 3 vases, maybe splitting them could be good. But I need to think about what the other player might want. If I take the chair, that's a big gain for me. But if the other player also wants the chair, we might end up with a conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the chair and some vases, leaving the wire for them. But I don't know their values. \n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items to fulfill both. So if I propose taking the chair and two vases, and the other player proposes taking the remaining vase and the wire, that would work. But if their proposal includes the chair, then we can't both have it. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nSince I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and one vase, leaving two vases and the wire. But if they also want the chair, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. That way, I get the highest value item and the least valuable. But if they also want the chair, that's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose two vases and the wire. That leaves one vase and the chair. If they take the chair and the remaining vase, that's complementary. But again, depends on their preferences. \n\nBut since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose items that maximize my value while leaving enough for the other player. The chair is the most valuable to me, so I should definitely try to get it. But if I take the chair, the other player might also want it. However, if I propose the chair, and they don't, then it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and one vase. That way, I get 3 + 2 = 5 points. The other player could take the remaining two vases and the wire. If their value for vases is higher than mine, they might take them. But if their value for vases is lower, they might not. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe the best approach is to propose the chair and one vase. That way, I get the highest value item and a moderate one. The other player can take the remaining two vases and the wire. If they value vases more than me, they might take them. If not, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. That gives me 3 + 1 = 4. The other player could take the three vases. If they value vases more, that's good. But if they don't, they might not. \n\nBut since I have to make a proposal, I need to choose. Let me think about the possible combinations. \n\nIf I propose the chair and one vase, that's 3 + 2 = 5. The other player could take two vases and the wire. If their value for vases is, say, 1 each, then they get 2 + 1 = 3. But if their value is higher, like 3 each, they get 6 + 1 = 7. But since I don't know, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the chair and two vases, that's 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Then the other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. If they value the vase at 2, they get 2 + 1 = 3. But if they value the vase more, maybe they take it. \n\nBut the problem is that if their proposal includes the chair, then we can't both have it. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn't include items that the other player might also want. But without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. That way, I get 3 + 1 = 4. The other player can take the three vases. If they value vases at 2 each, that's 6. But if they value them less, maybe they don't. \n\nBut since I have to make a proposal, I need to decide. The chair is the most valuable to me, so I should definitely include it. Then, maybe take one vase. That way, I get 3 + 2 = 5. The other player can take the remaining two vases and the wire. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. That's 3 + 1 = 4. The other player can take the three vases. If they value vases at 2 each, that's 6. But if they value them less, maybe they don't. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best is to take the chair and one vase. That way, I get 5, and the other player can take the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and two vases. That's 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Then the other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. If they value the vase at 2, that's 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nBut if the other player's value for the chair is higher than mine, they might propose to take it, leading to a conflict. But since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nAnother angle: the total items are 3 vases, 1 chair, 1 wire. If I take the chair and one vase, that's 2 items. The other player can take the remaining two vases and the wire. That's 3 items. So total items are covered. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the chair and two vases, that's 3 items. The other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. \n\nEither way, the proposals need to be complementary. So as long as the items don't overlap, it's okay. \n\nSo my proposal should be something like [Proposal: 3 chair, 1 vase] or [Proposal: 1 chair, 2 vases]. \n\nBut I need to format it correctly. The format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, ...]. \n\nSo for example, [Proposal: 1 chair, 2 vases]. \n\nAlternatively, [Proposal: 1 chair, 1 vase, 1 wire]. But that would take all items, leaving nothing for the other player. That would be bad because then their proposal would have to take nothing, which might not be possible. \n\nSo better to leave some items for the other player. \n\nSo the best bet is to take the chair and one or two vases. Let me go with the chair and one vase. That's [Proposal: 1 chair, 1 vase]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe take the chair and two vases. [Proposal: 1 chair, 2 vases]. \n\nWhich is better? If I take two vases, I get 3 + 2*2 = 7. If I take one vase, 3 + 2 = 5. But if the other player can take the remaining items, maybe they can get more. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, it's a risk. However, the chair is the most valuable to me, so I should prioritize getting it. \n\nSo I think the best proposal is to take the chair and one vase. That way, I get 5 points, and the other player can take the remaining two vases and the wire. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the chair and two vases, I get 7, but the other player can take the remaining vase and wire. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value for the chair is higher. If they also want the chair, then our proposals would conflict. But since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that's as good as possible. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the other player's value function is such that they value the chair more than me. But since I can't know, I have to assume that my proposal is the best I can do. \n\nSo I'll go with proposing the chair and one vase. That's [Proposal: 1 chair, 1 vase]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. [Proposal: 1 chair, 1 wire]. That gives me 3 + 1 = 4. The other player can take the three vases. If they value vases at 2 each, that's 6. \n\nBut if they value the chair more, they might not take the vases. \n\nBut again, without knowing, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and two vases. [Proposal: 1 chair, 2 vases]. That's 3 + 4 = 7. The other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. \n\nBut if the other player's value for the chair is higher, they might not accept. \n\nBut since I have to make a proposal, I think the best is to take the chair and two vases. That way, I maximize my own value. \n\nWait, but if I take two vases, that's 2*2=4, plus chair 3, total 7. The other player can take the remaining vase and the wire. If they value the vase at 2, that's 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nBut if they value the vase less, maybe they don't. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the chair and one vase, I get 5, and the other player can take two vases and the wire. If they value vases at 2 each, that's 4 + 1 = 5. \n\nSo in that case, both get 5. But if I take two vases, I get 7, and they get 3. \n\nBut if the other player's value for the chair is higher, they might not accept my proposal. \n\nBut since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that's as good as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and the wire. [Proposal: 1 chair, 1 wire]. That's 4. The other player can take the three vases. If they value vases at 2 each, that's 6. \n\nBut if they value the chair more, they might not. \n\nBut again, without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest is to take the chair and one vase. That way, I get 5, and the other player can take the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the chair and two vases. \n\nI think I'll go with the chair and two vases. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 chair, 2 vases]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include the chair. If they do, then we can't both have it. \n\nBut since I can't know, I have to make the best possible proposal. \n\nSo I'll proceed with that.\n"
