        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My secret value function is crayon: 0, chalk: 0, bolt: 5. So I only care about bolts. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own score.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should focus on the items I value, which are bolts. There are 2 bolts. If I can get both bolts, that would give me 10 points. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine. <br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that don&#x27;t overlap with what the other player might propose. <br/><br/>Since I value bolts, I should propose taking both bolts. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t also take bolts. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe they might also want bolts. But if I take both, then even if they take something else, it&#x27;s okay. Wait, but if I take both bolts, and they take something else, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also take bolts, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best strategy is to propose taking both bolts. That way, if they don&#x27;t take any bolts, then my proposal is valid. If they do take bolts, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose taking both bolts. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one bolt and something else. But since I don&#x27;t value crayons or chalk, that might not be good. Wait, but if I take one bolt and something else, maybe the other player can take the other bolt. But that would split the bolts, which might be worse for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking both bolts. Let me think. If I propose [Proposal: 2 bolts], then the other player might propose something else. If they don&#x27;t take any bolts, then my proposal is valid. If they do take bolts, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take both. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one bolt. But then the other player could take the other bolt. But if I take one, and they take one, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if I take one, and they take both, then it&#x27;s not. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But since my value for bolts is 5 each, getting both would give me 10. If I take one, I get 5. So better to take both. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that my proposal is valid. So I should send a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So I should send that. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that I can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So maybe I should just make the secret proposal right away. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 bolts]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include bolts, then I get both. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 bolt and 1 crayon, but since I don&#x27;t value crayons, that&#x27;s not helpful. Or maybe take 1 bolt and 1 chalk, but again, same issue. <br/><br/>No, the best is to take both bolts. So I should send the secret proposal for 2 bolts. That&#x27;s the optimal for me. <br/><br/>But wait, the other player might also value bolts. If they also propose 2 bolts, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to take the risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 bolt. Then, if the other player takes 1, it&#x27;s okay. If they take 2, then conflict. But if I take 1, I get 5, which is better than 0. But if I take 2, I get 10, which is better. <br/><br/>So the best is to propose 2 bolts. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal is [Proposal: 2 bolts]. That&#x27;s the message I should send.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, and 2 bolts. My values are crayon:1, chalk:3, bolt:2.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed the available quantities. For example, if I ask for 2 crayons and 1 chalk, and the other player asked for 1 crayon and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s okay because 2+1=3 crayons (available), 1 chalk (available), and 1 bolt (available, since there are 2). But if either of us asks for more than available, it&#x27;s a no-go.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as attractive as possible to me but also leaves room for the other player to have a compatible proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but not too many, so that there&#x27;s a chance the other player can also get some items.<br/><br/>My highest value item is chalk (3 points). So I should definitely try to get the chalk. Then bolts are next (2 points each), and crayons are least (1 each). So maybe propose chalk and some bolts. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>If I propose chalk and 1 bolt, that&#x27;s 3 + 2 = 5 points. Then the other player might have proposed something else. But if they also want chalk, that&#x27;s a problem. But since they made a secret proposal, maybe they didn&#x27;t ask for chalk. Alternatively, maybe they did. But I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 2 bolts. That would be 3 + 2*2 = 7 points. But there are only 2 bolts available. If the other player also wants bolts, that could conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get all bolts. But if they did, then we both get zero. So that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That&#x27;s 3 +1 =4. Then the other player could take the remaining 2 crayons and 2 bolts. But if they also want chalk, that&#x27;s a conflict. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s 3+2=5. Then the other player could take 2 crayons and 1 bolt. But if they also want chalk, then conflict. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get chalk and 1 bolt, and they get 2 crayons and 1 bolt. That would be okay.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible for me, but not too greedy. Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose chalk and 1 bolt, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 crayons and 1 chalk, then that&#x27;s a conflict on chalk. So both get zero. But if their proposal is 2 crayons and 1 bolt, then my proposal (chalk and 1 bolt) and theirs (2 crayons and 1 bolt) would have 1 bolt each, total 2 bolts. That&#x27;s okay. So I get chalk and 1 bolt (5 points), they get 2 crayons and 1 bolt (2*1 + 2 =4 points). That&#x27;s a good outcome.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose chalk and 2 bolts, and they propose something else. If they proposed 3 crayons and 1 chalk, then conflict on chalk. But if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then my 2 bolts and their 1 bolt would be 3 bolts, but there are only 2. So conflict. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>So maybe proposing chalk and 1 bolt is safer. Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. Let&#x27;s see. If I take chalk and 1 crayon (4 points), and the other player takes 2 crayons and 2 bolts (2*1 + 2*2=6 points). That&#x27;s possible. But if they also wanted chalk, then conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That way, I get the high value chalk and a crayon. The other player could take the remaining 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That would be 2*1 + 2*2 =6. So total for me is 4, them 6. That&#x27;s acceptable.<br/><br/>But maybe I can do better. What if I propose chalk and 2 bolts? That&#x27;s 3 + 2*2=7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include chalk or bolts, then I get all. But if they did, then conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s 5 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 crayons and 1 chalk, then conflict. But if their proposal is 2 crayons and 1 bolt, then I get chalk and 1 bolt, they get 2 crayons and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s okay. So 5 points for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. 4 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then I get chalk and 1 crayon, they get 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s okay. So 4 points.<br/><br/>But which is better? 5 vs 4. So 5 is better. So maybe propose chalk and 1 bolt. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Since I don&#x27;t know, but maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 chalk, then my proposal of chalk and 1 bolt would conflict on chalk. But if they proposed 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then my 1 bolt and their 1 bolt would be 2, which is okay. So in that case, I get chalk and 1 bolt (5), they get 3 crayons and 1 bolt (3*1 +2=5). That&#x27;s a good split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they proposed 1 chalk and 2 bolts, then my proposal would conflict on both chalk and bolts. So that&#x27;s bad. But I can&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>So the safest bet is to propose items that are high value to me but not too many, so that there&#x27;s a chance the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Since chalk is my highest value, I should definitely include that. Then, maybe 1 bolt. That way, even if the other player wants some bolts, there&#x27;s still one left. Or if they don&#x27;t want bolts, I get it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose chalk and 1 crayon. That&#x27;s 4 points. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then I get chalk and 1 crayon, they get 2 crayons and 2 bolts. That&#x27;s okay. So 4 points.<br/><br/>But 5 is better. So I think proposing chalk and 1 bolt is better. Let me check the available items again. There are 3 crayons, 1 chalk, 2 bolts. So if I take 1 chalk and 1 bolt, that leaves 3 crayons and 1 bolt. The other player could take 3 crayons and 1 bolt. That&#x27;s possible. So that would be complementary. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 chalk, 1 bolt]. That&#x27;s 3 + 2 =5 points. The other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include chalk or more than 1 bolt. If their proposal is, say, 3 crayons and 1 bolt, then total crayons 3 (mine 0, theirs 3) and bolts 1 (mine 1, theirs 1). That&#x27;s okay. So that works.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if their proposal is 2 crayons and 2 bolts, then my 1 chalk and 1 bolt would conflict with their 2 bolts (total 3, but only 2 available). So that&#x27;s a problem. But again, I don&#x27;t know their proposal.<br/><br/>But since the other player made a secret proposal, maybe they are trying to get as much as possible. But I can&#x27;t know. So the best I can do is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many, so that there&#x27;s a chance of compatibility.<br/><br/>Another angle: the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but maybe I can think about possible proposals they might make. For example, if they are rational, they might also want the chalk. So if I propose chalk, they might have also proposed chalk, leading to a conflict. But if I don&#x27;t propose chalk, maybe they can get it. But since I value chalk highly, I should propose it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that doesn&#x27;t include chalk. For example, maybe they proposed 3 crayons and 2 bolts. Then my proposal of chalk and 1 bolt would be compatible. So I get chalk and 1 bolt (5), they get 3 crayons and 2 bolts (3*1 + 2*2=7). That&#x27;s a good split.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess. However, given that I have to make a proposal, I should go with the highest value items I can get without overcommitting. So chalk and 1 bolt seems reasonable. Alternatively, chalk and 1 crayon. But chalk is more valuable.<br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is to take the chalk and 1 bolt. That gives me 5 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe I get nothing. But it&#x27;s a risk worth taking.<br/></p>
