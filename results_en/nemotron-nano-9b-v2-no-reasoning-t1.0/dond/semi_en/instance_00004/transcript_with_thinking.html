        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 orange, 1 pepper, and 3 pictures. My value function is orange:5, pepper:2, picture:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that maximizes my score.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The orange is worth 5, which is the highest. Then pepper is 2, and pictures are 1 each. Since there are 3 pictures, maybe I can take some of them. But I need to make sure that my proposal and the other player&#x27;s proposal don&#x27;t overlap in a way that makes them both get zero.<br/><br/>The key is to propose items that I value highly, but also leave enough for the other player to have a proposal that complements mine. If I take the orange, which is my highest value, then the other player might not want it, but if they do, we can&#x27;t both have it. Alternatively, maybe I can take the orange and some pictures, and leave the pepper and remaining pictures for them. But I don&#x27;t know their values. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning they don&#x27;t overlap in items, then each gets their items. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or that they can take without conflict. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but maybe more to them? Or maybe take the most valuable items for me and leave the rest.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to take the items I value the most. Let me think. If I take the orange (5) and maybe one pepper (2), that&#x27;s 7. Then leave the other pepper and 3 pictures. But if the other player&#x27;s value for pepper is high, they might want it. But if I take both peppers, then they can&#x27;t. But I don&#x27;t know. Alternatively, maybe take the orange and all three pictures. That would be 5 + 3*1 = 8. Then leave the pepper. But if the other player values the pepper, they might take it. But if they don&#x27;t, then my proposal is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper, and leave the pictures. But then the other player could take the pictures. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s secret value function is not given. So I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe the best way is to take the orange (since it&#x27;s the highest value for me) and maybe some pictures. Let me check the numbers. If I take the orange and one pepper, that&#x27;s 5+2=7. Then the other player can take the remaining pepper and 3 pictures. But if they value the pepper, they might take it. But if they don&#x27;t, then my proposal is better. Alternatively, if I take the orange and all three pictures, that&#x27;s 5+3=8. Then the other player can take the pepper. If they value the pepper, they get 2, which is better than nothing. But if they don&#x27;t, then they get nothing. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe taking the orange and pictures is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper, and the other player can take the pictures. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the goal is to maximize my own score, I should take the items I value the most. So the orange is definitely worth taking. Then, between pepper and pictures, the pepper is worth 2, which is more than a picture (1). So taking the pepper would be better. But if I take both orange and pepper, that&#x27;s 7. Then the other player can take the 3 pictures. If they value the pictures, they get 3. But if they don&#x27;t, they get nothing. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the orange and pepper, and leave the pictures. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. That&#x27;s 5+1=6. Then the other player can take the pepper and two pictures. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>But since I can only send a maximum of 5 messages, but the secret proposal is a single message. So I need to make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is the final offer. So I need to decide what to propose. <br/><br/>The secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So I need to list the items I want. <br/><br/>If I propose the orange and the pepper, that&#x27;s [Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]. Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not include those items. If they propose the 3 pictures, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, like the orange, then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the orange and all three pictures, that&#x27;s [Proposal: 1 orange, 3 pictures]. Then the other player can take the pepper. If they value the pepper, they get 2. If not, they get nothing. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest is to take the orange and the pepper, as they are higher value for me. But if the other player also values the pepper, then their proposal might conflict. However, if I take the orange and pepper, and they take the pictures, that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and leave the rest. But then the other player can take everything else. But if they value the pepper and pictures, they might get more. <br/><br/>But since my goal is to maximize my own score, I should take the items I value the most. So the orange is a must. Then, between pepper and pictures, the pepper is better. So I should propose the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>But wait, if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take them. But if they don&#x27;t want them, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they do, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and one picture. That way, I get 5+1=6, and leave the pepper and two pictures. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>But without knowing their values, the best I can do is to take the items I value the most. So the orange is the highest, then pepper. So I should propose the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and all three pictures. That&#x27;s 5+3=8. Then the other player can take the pepper. If they value the pepper, they get 2. If not, they get nothing. But 8 is better than 7. So maybe that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the pepper more than 2, then they might take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe taking the orange and pictures is better. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. So maybe the best is to take the orange and the pepper, as they are higher value for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and one picture. But that&#x27;s 6. <br/><br/>Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. Since I can&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make an assumption. <br/><br/>Another approach: the total value of all items is 5 (orange) + 2 (pepper) + 3*1 (pictures) = 10. If I can get the orange and pepper, that&#x27;s 7, and the other player gets 3. If I take the orange and pictures, that&#x27;s 8, and the other player gets 2. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value for the pepper is higher than 2, then they might prefer to take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the orange and pictures. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the pepper is low. For example, if they value the pepper as 1, then taking the orange and pepper would give me 7, and they get 3 (pictures). But if they value the pepper as 3, then they would want it. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to take the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes those, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 7. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the orange and one picture. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. Let me think again. <br/><br/>If I take the orange (5) and the pepper (2), total 7. The other player can take the 3 pictures (3). If they value the pictures, they get 3. If not, they get nothing. <br/><br/>If I take the orange and 3 pictures (8), the other player can take the pepper (2). If they value the pepper, they get 2. <br/><br/>So in both cases, my score is higher. But which is better? 7 vs 8. 8 is better. So maybe taking the orange and all three pictures is better. <br/><br/>But why would the other player take the pepper? If they value it more than 2, they would. But if they value it less, they might not. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe taking the orange and pictures is better. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the orange and the pepper, and the other player can take the pictures. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>But since my goal is to maximize my own score, I should take the items I value the most. So the orange is a must. Then, between pepper and pictures, the pepper is more valuable. So I should take the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>But if the other player also values the pepper, then their proposal might conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 7. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the orange and the pepper, and the other player takes the pictures, that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is to take the orange and the pepper. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper].<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. The items available are 1 orange, 1 pepper, 3 pictures. My values are orange:7, pepper:3, picture:0. So I really want the orange and maybe the pepper, but pictures are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they&#x27;re trying to get certain items. Since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, I need to make my own. The key is to propose items that I value highly, but also considering that if our proposals are complementary, we both get the items. Otherwise, we get nothing.<br/><br/>Wait, but how do I know if their proposal is compatible? Since I can&#x27;t see it, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict. For example, if I take the orange and pepper, but if they also want those, then we can&#x27;t both get them. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the items I value most, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them, but I don&#x27;t know their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the orange and pepper, since those are the only items I value. If they also propose those, then we can&#x27;t both get them, so we get zero. But if they didn&#x27;t propose those, then we can both get them. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is risky. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the orange, since it&#x27;s the most valuable. Or maybe propose nothing, but that would give me zero. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items to fulfill both. So if I propose the orange and pepper, and they propose, say, the orange and a picture, then we can&#x27;t both get the orange. So we get zero. But if they propose something else, like a picture, then we can both get our items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s secret proposal is something I can infer. But since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t. So I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible. Maybe I should propose the orange and pepper, but that&#x27;s risky. Alternatively, maybe propose only the orange, since it&#x27;s the most valuable. Or maybe propose nothing, but that&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. So maybe the best strategy is to propose the items I value most, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if I propose the orange and pepper, and they propose something else, like a picture, then we can both get our items. But if they also propose the orange, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the orange and pepper, and if they don&#x27;t, then I get both. If they do, then we get nothing. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the orange. Because if they also want the orange, then we can&#x27;t both get it. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get the orange. But if I propose only the orange, and they propose the pepper, then we can both get our items. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing. But that would give me zero. Not good. So the best bet is to propose the items I value most. So I should propose the orange and pepper. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets: &quot;[Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]&quot;. But I need to make sure that the items are available. Since there&#x27;s 1 orange and 1 pepper, that&#x27;s possible. The pictures are 3, but I don&#x27;t value them. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 orange, 1 pepper]. That&#x27;s my best chance to get the items I value. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then I get both. If it does, then we get nothing. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>
