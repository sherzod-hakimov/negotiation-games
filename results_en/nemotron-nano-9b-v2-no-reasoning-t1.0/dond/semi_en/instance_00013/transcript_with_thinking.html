        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My value function is paper:1, clock:1, potato:2. So potatoes are the most valuable to me, followed by papers and clocks equally.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items more. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should try to propose items that are valuable to me but maybe less so to them, or find a balance.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available), then we get points based on our own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a safe one.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might also be trying to maximize their own score. So maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but low to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Alternatively, maybe propose a balanced set.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals. For example, if I take all the potatoes (2), that&#x27;s 2*2=4 points. But if the other player also wants potatoes, that could conflict. Alternatively, take some potatoes and some papers. Since papers are 1 each, maybe take 2 papers and 2 potatoes. That would be 2*1 + 2*2 = 6 points. But if the other player also wants those, maybe that&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That&#x27;s 2*2 +1*1=5. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many. Also, considering that the other player might have similar or different preferences.<br/><br/>Another thought: since there are 4 papers, maybe split them. But if I take 2 papers, that&#x27;s 2 points. But if the other player also takes 2, that&#x27;s okay. But if they take more, it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That&#x27;s 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes and 2 papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take more, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible for me, while leaving enough for them. For example, if I take 2 potatoes (which are my highest value), and maybe 1 clock. That&#x27;s 2*2 +1*1=5. Then, if the other player takes the remaining 2 potatoes and 1 clock, but that&#x27;s not possible because there are only 2 potatoes. Wait, no, if I take 2 potatoes, there are none left. So maybe that&#x27;s a good idea. But if the other player also wants potatoes, then their proposal would conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should take the potatoes first.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes and 2 papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take more, then it&#x27;s a problem. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That&#x27;s 5 points. Then, if the other player takes the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, that&#x27;s possible. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose the best possible one. Let me think about the maximum I can get. If I can get all 2 potatoes, that&#x27;s 4 points. But if the other player also wants them, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if I can get them, that&#x27;s good. So maybe propose 2 potatoes. But maybe also add some papers or clocks to make it more attractive.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes and 2 papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take more, then it&#x27;s a problem. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That&#x27;s 5 points. But maybe the other player would prefer clocks. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player might have different values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to them. But without knowing, it&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the best is to propose the items I value the most, which are potatoes. So 2 potatoes. That&#x27;s 4 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes, then it&#x27;s okay. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s a risk. Alternatively, maybe split the potatoes. But if I take 1 potato, that&#x27;s 2 points. But maybe the other player takes the other one. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 clocks and 2 potatoes, then there&#x27;s a conflict on potatoes. But if their proposal is 2 clocks and 2 papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That&#x27;s 5 points. If the other player takes 2 papers and 1 clock, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take 2 potatoes, then conflict.<br/><br/>Hmm. Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose 2 potatoes. That&#x27;s 4 points. If the other player also wants them, then we both get zero. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 4. Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes and 2 papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take more, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, but the secret proposal is one message. So I need to make a single secret proposal. The key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player&#x27;s proposal. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s challenging.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose a balanced set. For example, 2 potatoes, 1 clock, 1 paper. That&#x27;s 2*2 +1*1 +1*1=6. But that&#x27;s 4 items. The other player might take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 2 clocks. That&#x27;s 2*2 +2*1=6. But if the other player also wants clocks, that&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 1 paper. That&#x27;s 2*2 +1*1=5. That&#x27;s a good balance. If the other player takes 2 papers and 1 clock, then it&#x27;s okay. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are potatoes. So 2 potatoes. That&#x27;s 4 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes, then it&#x27;s okay. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe add some papers to make it more attractive. For example, 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is 2 clocks and 2 potatoes, then conflict. But if their proposal is 2 clocks and 2 papers, then it&#x27;s okay. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That&#x27;s 5 points. If the other player takes 2 papers and 1 clock, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take 2 potatoes, then conflict.<br/><br/>I think I need to make a decision here. Since potatoes are my highest value, I should propose taking them. So I&#x27;ll go with 2 potatoes. That&#x27;s 4 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take more than 2 potatoes, then it&#x27;s okay. Otherwise, zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my own score. The items available are 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My value function is paper: 0, clock: 4, potato: 1. So clocks are super valuable to me, potatoes are a bit, and papers don&#x27;t matter.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I should consider possible scenarios. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to propose something that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t overlap in items, and maximizes my own value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that takes the most valuable items for me, which are clocks. Since there are 2 clocks, if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take any. But if I take one clock, maybe they take the other. But since clocks are worth 4 each, taking both would give me 8 points. If I take one, 4 points. But if I take both, the other player can&#x27;t take any, so their proposal would have to not include clocks. But if their proposal includes clocks, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose taking both clocks. But how do I know if that&#x27;s possible?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. Since I don&#x27;t have information about their proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. Let me think. If I propose to take both clocks, then if their proposal doesn&#x27;t include any clocks, we can both get them. But if their proposal includes clocks, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose taking both clocks. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one clock and some potatoes. But potatoes are only worth 1 each. So taking two potatoes would be 2 points. But if I take one clock (4) and one potato (1), that&#x27;s 5. But if I take two clocks, that&#x27;s 8. So better to take both clocks.<br/><br/>But wait, the other player might have a proposal that includes clocks. If I take both, and they also take some, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose taking both clocks. But if their proposal is, say, taking one clock, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So in that case, we both get zero. But if their proposal is taking something else, like papers or potatoes, then I can take both clocks. So maybe the best strategy is to propose taking both clocks. That way, if their proposal doesn&#x27;t include clocks, I get 8 points. If it does, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking one clock and some potatoes. But that&#x27;s less valuable. Or maybe take one clock and some papers. But papers are worthless. So the best is to take both clocks. So my proposal should be [Proposal: 2 clocks]. That&#x27;s the most valuable for me. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to write that. So the message would be [Proposal: 2 clocks]. That&#x27;s my secret proposal. I think that&#x27;s the best move here.<br/></p>
