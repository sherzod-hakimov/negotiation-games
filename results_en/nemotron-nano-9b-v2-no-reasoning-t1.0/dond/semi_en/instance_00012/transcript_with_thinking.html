        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, and 1 rope. My value function is lamp:3, thimble:2, rope:1. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary to theirs. If both proposals can be fulfilled, we get points based on our values; otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>First, I should think about what items are most valuable to me. The lamp is worth 3, which is the highest. Then thimbles at 2 each, and rope at 1. Since there are 3 thimbles, maybe splitting them could be good. But I need to consider that the other player might also value them. <br/><br/>If I take the lamp, that&#x27;s 3 points. Then maybe take some thimbles. But if I take all three thimbles, that&#x27;s 6 points. But maybe the other player also wants thimbles. Alternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope. The rope is only 1 point, but maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t want it. <br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. So I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. For example, if I take the lamp and some thimbles, and leave the rope for them. But if the other player also values the rope, that could be a problem. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. That way, I get 3+1=4 points. The other player could take the thimbles. But if they value thimbles highly, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take the rope instead. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and one thimble. That&#x27;s 3+2=5. Then the other player could take the remaining two thimbles and the rope. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. Maybe the best approach is to take the lamp and as many thimbles as possible. Since there are 3 thimbles, maybe take 2 thimbles. That would be 3+2*2=7 points. Then the other player could take the remaining 1 thimble and the rope. But if they value the thimble and rope, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope. That&#x27;s 4 points. Then the other player can take all 3 thimbles. If they value thimbles, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that my proposal is complementary. So if I propose the lamp and 2 thimbles, and the other player proposes the remaining 1 thimble and the rope, that&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, like the lamp and the rope, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that there are enough items to fulfill both. So if I propose [lamp, thimble, thimble], and the other player proposes [thimble, rope], then that&#x27;s complementary because there&#x27;s 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, 1 rope. So my proposal takes 1 lamp and 2 thimbles, the other takes 1 thimble and 1 rope. That works. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [lamp, rope], and they propose [thimble, thimble, thimble], that&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>But which proposal is better for me? If I take the lamp and 2 thimbles, I get 3 + 2*2 = 7. If I take the lamp and the rope, I get 3 +1=4. So the first option is better. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player would prefer the rope. If they value the rope more than thimbles, then my proposal of lamp and 2 thimbles might not be accepted. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an educated guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. That way, I get 4 points, and the other player can take the thimbles. If they value thimbles, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take the rope, but then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Hmm. This is tricky. Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest bet is to take the lamp and as many thimbles as possible. Because the lamp is the highest value item. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 lamp, 2 thimbles]. That way, I get 3 + 2*2 = 7 points. The other player would need to take the remaining 1 thimble and the rope. If they accept, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe they would propose something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. But that&#x27;s only 4 points. <br/><br/>Another thought: since there are 3 thimbles, maybe splitting them 2-1. If I take 2 thimbles, the other takes 1. But if they value thimbles more, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the lamp and the rope, and leave the thimbles for them. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>I think the best approach is to take the lamp and 2 thimbles. That maximizes my value. So I&#x27;ll make that my secret proposal.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, and 1 rope. My values are lamp:3, thimble:1, rope:4.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed the available items. For example, if I ask for the lamp and the rope, and the other player also asks for the lamp, that&#x27;s a conflict. So I need to propose items that don&#x27;t overlap with what the other might have.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me and low for them, or vice versa. Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Hmm. The problem is that without knowing their secret values, it&#x27;s tricky. But maybe I can assume that they might have similar or different priorities.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or have high value. For instance, the rope is worth 4 to me, which is higher than the lamp (3) and thimbles (1). So maybe I should try to get the rope. But if the other player also wants the rope, that could be a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. But if the other player also wants the lamp, that&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a safe proposal.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I can&#x27;t know. But maybe I can make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. For example, if I take the rope and some thimbles, and the other player takes the lamp and maybe some thimbles. But I need to make sure that the total items don&#x27;t exceed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. Let me check the available items. There&#x27;s 1 lamp, 3 thimbles, 1 rope. So if I take the lamp and rope, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player could take the thimbles. But if they also want the lamp or rope, that&#x27;s a problem. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the rope and some thimbles. For example, &quot;Proposal: 1 rope, 2 thimbles&quot;. That way, if the other player takes the lamp and maybe some thimbles, it could work. But I need to make sure that the total items don&#x27;t exceed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. Let me think. If I take the lamp (3 points) and the rope (4 points), that&#x27;s 7 points. If the other player takes the thimbles, that&#x27;s 3 thimbles (3 points for them). But if they also want the lamp or rope, that&#x27;s a conflict. But since their proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. However, if I propose the lamp and rope, and they propose something else, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also propose the lamp or rope, then it&#x27;s not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the rope and some thimbles. For example, &quot;Proposal: 1 rope, 1 thimble&quot;. That way, if the other player takes the lamp and the remaining thimbles, that&#x27;s possible. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible to avoid conflicts. For example, if I take the rope (which is high value for me) and maybe some thimbles. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in high demand. For example, thimbles are low value for me (1 each), but maybe the other player values them more. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the lamp and the rope. Let me check the total. If I take lamp and rope, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player could take the 3 thimbles. That would be complementary. So that&#x27;s a possible scenario. If their proposal is, say, the thimbles, then it works. But if their proposal includes the lamp or rope, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the rope and the lamp. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the rope and some thimbles. Let me think about the value. The rope is worth 4, which is the highest. So getting that would be good. The lamp is 3, which is also good. Thimbles are 1 each. So maybe I should prioritize the rope and lamp.<br/><br/>But if I propose both, and the other player also wants one of them, then it&#x27;s a problem. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the rope and the lamp. Let me go with that. So the proposal would be &quot;Proposal: 1 lamp, 1 rope&quot;. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, it&#x27;s good. If they do, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I have to make a proposal, this seems like a reasonable choice.<br/></p>
