    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, and 1 eraser. My value function is bowl:5, bottle:5, fruit:0, eraser:0. So I really want the bowl and bottle, and the fruits and eraser don&#x27;t matter to me. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my chances of getting the items I value. <br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other&#x27;s don&#x27;t overlap on items that are limited. <br/><br/>Since I have a secret proposal option, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. But the problem says I can send up to 5 messages or terminate early with a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is formatted as &quot;[Proposal: ...]&quot;. So if I send that, the other player will see it, but I can&#x27;t communicate anything else. Alternatively, I can send regular messages, but they have to be in the format without square brackets. <br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the negotiation. So maybe I should first send a regular message to the other player, proposing something. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to think about what&#x27;s best for me. <br/><br/>My goal is to get the bowl and bottle. The other player might also want those. So if I propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes something else, maybe we can agree. But if they also want those, then we might have a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to take the bowl and bottle, and offer the fruits and eraser to the other player. Since the fruits and eraser are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. If I propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then we can both get our items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can get the items I want without the other player knowing. But the problem says that the secret proposal is made at any time, and if it&#x27;s complementary, then both get their items. <br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is a way to propose without the other player knowing until they accept. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then each is awarded based on their items. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal (whether secret or not) is compatible, then we both get our items. <br/><br/>But since I can only make a secret proposal once, maybe I should do that. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of taking the bowl and bottle, then the other player might make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if they take the fruits and eraser, then we can both get our items. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the bowl or bottle, then their proposal would conflict, and we both get zero. So maybe I should make a secret proposal to take the bowl and bottle. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should first send a regular message to the other player, suggesting that I want the bowl and bottle, and offer the fruits and eraser. But since I can&#x27;t use square brackets in regular messages, I have to phrase it as a regular message. <br/><br/>But the user is the one who is supposed to start. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. <br/><br/>The secret proposal is formatted as &quot;[Proposal: ...]&quot;. So if I send that, the other player will see it. But if I send a regular message, it&#x27;s transmitted directly. <br/><br/>But the problem says that the user is to start. So maybe the first step is to make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a regular message first. For example, &quot;I want the bowl and bottle. Let me know if you want those.&quot; But since I can&#x27;t use square brackets, I have to phrase it as a regular message. <br/><br/>But the user is supposed to make a secret proposal. Wait, the instructions say that the user can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal immediately. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be to take the bowl and bottle. The other player&#x27;s proposal would need to not take those items. If they take the fruits and eraser, then we can both get our items. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe they might also want the bowl or bottle. However, since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bowl and bottle, and the other player might propose something else. If their proposal is compatible, then we both get our items. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those items. If they do, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bowl and bottle, and offer the fruits and eraser. But since the fruits and eraser are worthless to me, maybe I can offer them to the other player. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal to take the bowl and bottle. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, I get both. If they do, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t communicate after that, maybe that&#x27;s the best approach. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a regular message first. For example, &quot;I&#x27;m willing to take the bowl and bottle. Let me know if you want those.&quot; But since I can&#x27;t use square brackets, I have to phrase it as a regular message. <br/><br/>But the problem says that the user is to start. So maybe the first message is a regular message. <br/><br/>But the user is supposed to make a secret proposal. Wait, the instructions say that the user can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal first. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with making a secret proposal to take the bowl and bottle. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, I get both. If not, we both get zero. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player might also want those items. However, since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, 1 eraser. My values are bowl:1, bottle:0, fruit:3 each, eraser:3.<br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player proposed. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user didn&#x27;t include the actual proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. How can I respond without knowing what the other player proposed?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate a proposal based on the given items and my value function. But the rules say that if proposals are complementary, we get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, covers all items without overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers as much as possible of the high-value items for me.<br/><br/>My high-value items are fruits (3 each) and eraser (3). The bowl is only 1, and bottle is 0. So I should aim to get both fruits and the eraser. But there are two fruits. If I take both, that&#x27;s 6 points. The eraser is another 3. So total 9. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. However, since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose taking the fruits and eraser. But if the other player also wants those, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the fruits and eraser, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to respond to. But since the user hasn&#x27;t provided it, perhaps this is a test case where I need to generate a proposal. Wait, the initial setup says that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but the user hasn&#x27;t told me what it is. That&#x27;s confusing. Maybe this is a mistake, or perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that I have to make a proposal regardless.<br/><br/>In that case, I should make a proposal that maximizes my own value. So I should take the items I value most. The fruits are worth 3 each, so two fruits would be 6. The eraser is 3. So total 9. The bowl is 1, which is less. So I should propose taking both fruits and the eraser. But I need to format it as [Proposal: 2 fruits, 1 eraser]. But wait, the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So the numbers are quantities. So for two fruits, it&#x27;s &quot;2 fruits&quot;, and 1 eraser. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 2 fruits, 1 eraser].<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that this is a valid proposal. The other player&#x27;s proposal might conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make the best possible one. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the fruits and the eraser, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But since my goal is to maximize my score, I should propose the items I value most. So that&#x27;s the plan.<br/></p>
