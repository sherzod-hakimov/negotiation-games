My value function is candy: 2, fruit: 2, hat: 0. So I value candies and fruits equally, and the hat is worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since I don't know it, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that maximizes my own gain regardless. Since the goal is to get as much as possible, I should propose items that I value highly. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other's don't overlap in a way that exceeds the available items.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But wait, the instructions say that unless it's the secret proposal, messages are transmitted. So if I make a secret proposal, it's not sent to the other player. But how does that work? Maybe the secret proposal is a way to propose without the other player knowing, but I'm not sure. The rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then they are awarded. So perhaps both players make secret proposals, and if they don't conflict, they get their items. But I need to check the exact rules.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\" So making a secret proposal is an alternative to sending messages. So if I make a secret proposal, that's my final offer, and the other player might do the same. Then, if their proposals are complementary, they get their items. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's value function, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Since I value candies and fruits, I should propose those. The hat is worthless to me, so I can offer it to the other player if needed.\n\nSo my secret proposal could be to take all the candies and fruits. Let me check: 3 candies and 2 fruits. That's 5 items. The other player's proposal would need to not take any of these. But if they propose something else, like the hat, then it's okay. But if they also propose candies or fruits, then there's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a subset. For example, take 2 candies and 1 fruit. That leaves 1 candy and 1 fruit for the other player. But if the other player also wants those, then it's a conflict. But since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should take as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take all the candies and fruits, and leave the hat for the other player. That way, if the other player's proposal is to take the hat, then it's complementary. But if they also want candies or fruits, then it's a conflict.\n\nBut since I can't know their preferences, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value most. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 candies, 2 fruits]. That way, I get all the items I value. If the other player's proposal doesn't take any of these, then we both get our items. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their proposal, this is a risk. However, given that I can't communicate, maybe this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a smaller set. For example, 2 candies and 1 fruit. That leaves 1 candy and 1 fruit. If the other player takes those, then it's okay. But again, without knowing their preferences, it's hard to say.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize my own score, I should take as much as possible. So I'll go with the secret proposal of 3 candies and 2 fruits. That's the maximum I can get. If the other player's proposal is compatible, I get all. If not, zero. But since I can't know, this is the best bet.\n"

                    "content": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My values are candy:1, fruit:1, hat:5. \n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don't know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don't exceed the available quantities), then we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get nothing.\n\nSo my goal is to propose items in a way that maximizes my own value while ensuring that the other player's proposal plus mine doesn't exceed the available items. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe I can propose items that are high value for me but low for them, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but since the other player's proposal is secret, I can't know for sure. However, maybe I can think about possible scenarios. For example, if the other player proposed the hat (which is worth 5 to me), then I might want to avoid that. But if they proposed something else, maybe I can take the hat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat, since it's the highest value item for me. But if the other player also proposed the hat, then we can't both get it, so we both get zero. So I need to balance between taking high-value items and ensuring that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value for me and low for them. For example, if I propose the hat, which is worth 5 to me, but maybe the other player values it less. However, without knowing their values, it's tricky. Wait, the problem states that each has a secret value function, but I only know my own. So I don't know the other player's values. That complicates things.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should focus on maximizing my own value, assuming that the other player's proposal might not conflict. But how? If I propose the hat, and the other player also proposed the hat, then we both get zero. But if they didn't, then I get 5. Alternatively, if I propose something else, like candies or fruits, which are lower value for me, but maybe the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a combination of items. For example, take the hat and some candies. But again, without knowing the other's proposal, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So I need to make sure that my proposal plus the other's doesn't exceed the available items. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat, since it's the most valuable to me. If the other player didn't propose the hat, then I can get it. If they did, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's proposal is something else. For example, if they proposed 2 fruits and 1 hat, then my proposal of the hat would conflict. But if they proposed 3 candies and 2 fruits, then my proposal of the hat would be okay.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the safest bet is to propose the hat. Because if the other player didn't take it, I get 5. If they did, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's proposal is not the hat. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a combination that includes the hat and some other items, but that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that's not allowed. The rules say I have to submit a secret proposal. So I need to make a proposal.\n\nAnother angle: the other player's proposal is secret, but maybe I can think about possible proposals they might make. For example, if they are trying to maximize their own value, they might propose the hat as well. But without knowing their values, it's impossible to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and some other items. For example, \"Proposal: 1 hat, 2 candies\". But if the other player also proposed the hat, then we can't both get it. But if they didn't, then I get the hat and 2 candies. However, the other player's proposal might have different items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and 1 fruit. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and 1 candy. But again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and 2 fruits. But that's 2 fruits, which is the total available. If the other player also proposed 2 fruits, then we can't both get them. But if they didn't, then I can get them.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the hat, as it's the highest value item for me. Even if there's a risk of conflict, it's worth the gamble. Because if the other player didn't take it, I get 5. If they did, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's proposal is not the hat. For example, if they proposed 3 candies and 2 fruits, then my proposal of the hat would be compatible, and I get 5. That's better than not taking the hat.\n\nAlternatively, if the other player proposed the hat, then I can't get it. But maybe they didn't. So I think proposing the hat is the best bet.\n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hat]. That way, if the other player didn't propose the hat, I get it. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I don't know, this is the best I can do.\n"
