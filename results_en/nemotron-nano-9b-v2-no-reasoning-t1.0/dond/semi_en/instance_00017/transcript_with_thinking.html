        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, and 2 lemons. My value function is plate: 0, coin: 2, candy: 4, lemon: 0. So I really value candies and coins, but plates and lemons don&#x27;t matter to me. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should focus on maximizing my own score. <br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), we get points based on our own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. <br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose. <br/><br/>My goal is to get as many candies and coins as possible. Let&#x27;s look at the items. There&#x27;s 1 coin, so if I take that, the other player can&#x27;t. But if I don&#x27;t take it, maybe they will. But since I don&#x27;t know their value, maybe I should take the coin. <br/><br/>For candies, there are 2. If I take both, that&#x27;s good for me. But if the other player also wants some, maybe we can split. But since I don&#x27;t know their value, maybe taking both is better. <br/><br/>Plates and lemons are worthless to me, so I can offer those to the other player if needed. <br/><br/>So my proposal should include the coin and both candies. Let me check: 1 coin, 2 candies. That&#x27;s 3 items. The other player&#x27;s proposal would need to take the remaining items: 2 plates and 2 lemons. But since plates and lemons are worthless to me, maybe that&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Wait, but if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes plates or lemons, that&#x27;s fine. But if their proposal includes items I have, then it might conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the coin and one candy, leaving one candy for the other player. But that might not be optimal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the coin and both candies. Let me think. If I take the coin and both candies, that&#x27;s 3 items. The other player would need to take the remaining 2 plates and 2 lemons. Since those are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, since my value function is known, I can structure my proposal to maximize my own gain. <br/><br/>So the best I can do is take the coin (value 2) and both candies (value 4 each, so 8 total). That&#x27;s 10 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then I get 10. If their proposal conflicts, we both get zero. <br/><br/>But how to ensure that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict? Since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal now. The secret proposal is the final offer. So I need to decide what to propose. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 candies]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, I get those items. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player might also want the coin or candies. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the coin and one candy, leaving one candy for the other player. But that would give me 2 + 4 = 6 points. But if the other player takes the other candy, maybe they get more. But again, without knowing their value, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>But since my value for candies is 4 each, taking both is better. So I should propose taking both candies and the coin. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 candies]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should also include plates or lemons to make the proposal more comprehensive. But since they are worthless to me, it&#x27;s better to not include them. <br/><br/>So the final proposal is to take the coin and both candies. That&#x27;s the best I can do given my value function.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. First, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, right, in the initial setup, the user is supposed to simulate the other player&#x27;s proposal. But in this case, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s proposal. Wait, maybe this is part of a role-play where I have to generate my own proposal based on the given info.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s message says: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user hasn&#x27;t provided what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. That&#x27;s a problem. Without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t determine if it&#x27;s complementary. But maybe in this scenario, the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to infer or maybe it&#x27;s a test case. Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting me to generate a proposal without knowing the other&#x27;s, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense because the success depends on both proposals being complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical situation where I have to make a proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown. But that&#x27;s not possible because the outcome depends on both. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is given in the problem, but I need to check again. Let me re-read the problem.<br/><br/>The problem states: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But there&#x27;s no information about what the other player&#x27;s proposal is. That&#x27;s a critical missing piece. Without knowing what the other player is proposing, I can&#x27;t decide what to propose. Unless this is a test where I have to make a proposal regardless, but that seems odd.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is simulating the other player&#x27;s proposal, and I need to respond. But in the current setup, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s proposal. This is confusing. Maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to assume. For example, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is a certain set of items, and I have to respond optimally. But without that info, I can&#x27;t proceed.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on my own value function, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown. But that&#x27;s not possible because the success of the proposal depends on both. So perhaps this is a scenario where I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary, but without knowing the other&#x27;s, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the initial setup. Let me check again. The initial problem says: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But there&#x27;s no details. This seems like an error. Maybe in the actual game, the other player&#x27;s proposal would be given, but in this case, it&#x27;s missing. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe this is a test where I have to make a proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is not provided, but I have to proceed. But that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t determine if it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the user is expecting me to generate a proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is not given, but I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. But that&#x27;s not possible because the success depends on both. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. For example, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is different, but since it&#x27;s secret, I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>This is a problem. Without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t make an informed decision. But since the user is asking me to submit a proposal, perhaps I need to make a proposal based on my own value function, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that might be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is a specific set of items, but since it&#x27;s secret, I don&#x27;t know. In that case, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value, but also tries to be complementary. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, each player gets their value. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player&#x27;s. But without knowing their proposal, I can&#x27;t be sure. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can guess. For example, if the other player&#x27;s value function is different, they might propose items they value more. But since I don&#x27;t have that info, I can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is given in the problem, but I missed it. Let me check again. The user&#x27;s message says: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But there&#x27;s no content. <br/><br/>This is a critical issue. Without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t proceed. However, since this is a simulation, perhaps the user expects me to generate a proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is not provided, but I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the initial setup. Wait, the initial problem says: &quot;The set of available items is: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons.&quot; So the total items are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. <br/><br/>If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, for example, taking 1 plate, 1 coin, 1 candy, 1 lemon, then my proposal would need to take the remaining items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>But in this case, since the user is asking me to submit a proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes items I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. <br/><br/>Given my value function: plate (1), coin (4), candy (0), lemon (2). So the coin is the most valuable, then lemon, then plate, and candy is worthless. <br/><br/>So I should prioritize getting the coin and lemons. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal also includes the coin, then we can&#x27;t both get it. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>In that case, I should propose items that I value highly. For example, the coin (4 points) and lemons (2 each). But since there are 2 lemons, maybe I can take both. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the coin, then we can&#x27;t both get it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the coin and one lemon, and the other player might propose the other lemon and something else. <br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not compatible, so I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>But this is all speculative. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to make a proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is not given, but I have to proceed. <br/><br/>In that case, I should make a proposal that includes the items I value most. So the coin (4) and lemons (2 each). Since there are 2 lemons, I can take both. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 lemons]. <br/><br/>But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible. The total items are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. <br/><br/>If I take 1 coin and 2 lemons, that&#x27;s 1 coin and 2 lemons. The other player&#x27;s proposal would need to take the remaining items: 2 plates, 2 candies. <br/><br/>If their proposal is that, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But if their proposal includes the coin, then it&#x27;s not. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the coin and one lemon, leaving one lemon for the other player. But that might not be optimal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the coin and one lemon, and the other player might propose the other lemon and something else. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>In that case, I should propose the coin and both lemons. That gives me 4 + 2*2 = 8 points. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the coin, then we can&#x27;t both get it. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to take the risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the coin and one lemon, and the other player might take the other lemon. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not compatible, so I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>In any case, the best I can do is to propose the items I value most. So the coin and lemons. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 lemons]. <br/><br/>But I need to format it correctly. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. <br/><br/>So the numbers should be the quantity. <br/><br/>So for 1 coin and 2 lemons, it would be [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 lemons]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I want to take 1 coin and 1 lemon, that&#x27;s [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 lemon]. <br/><br/>But which is better? If I take 2 lemons, I get 4 points. If I take 1 lemon, I get 2. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the coin, then I can&#x27;t get it. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to choose. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the coin and one lemon, and the other player might take the other lemon. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the coin and one lemon, and the other player&#x27;s proposal might include the other lemon. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the best I can do is to propose the items I value most, which are the coin and lemons. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 lemons].<br/></p>
