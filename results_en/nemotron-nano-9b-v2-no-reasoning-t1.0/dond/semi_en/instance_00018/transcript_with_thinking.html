    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize my score. The items available are 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, and 2 boxes. My value function is stick:5, towel:2, toy:1, box:1. So the stick is super valuable to me, then the towel, then the toy and boxes are less.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. But since I can&#x27;t know, I should focus on my own values and try to get the items I value most.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then we get points based on our own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or maybe they have different priorities.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can do it in fewer. The secret proposal is the key here. I need to make a secret proposal that includes items I want, and hope the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>But how do I coordinate? Since messages are transmitted directly, I need to communicate my proposal in a way that the other player can respond. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and maybe leave some items for them.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose the stick, which is my highest value, maybe the other player might not want it. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So maybe I should propose the stick, and then see if they propose something else. But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, which are my top two. But if they also want those, then we can&#x27;t both have them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes, since boxes are less valuable to me but maybe they value them more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then in the messages, suggest that the other player take the toy and boxes. But I need to make sure that my proposal is compatible with theirs.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value most, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if I propose the stick and the towel, and they propose the toy and boxes, then we can both get our items. But if they also want the stick or towel, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes, and then in messages, suggest that they take the towel and toy. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the secret proposal is made at any time. So maybe I can make a secret proposal first. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player can&#x27;t see it until they make their own. But if I make a secret proposal, and they make a secret proposal, then we check if they are complementary.<br/><br/>But the rules say that you can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So maybe I should make a secret proposal early to lock in my items.<br/><br/>But how to structure the secret proposal. The format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So for example, if I want the stick and the towel, I would write &quot;[Proposal: 1 stick, 1 towel]&quot;.<br/><br/>But if I do that, then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include those items. So if I propose stick and towel, and they propose toy and boxes, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they also propose stick or towel, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the items I value most, and hope that they don&#x27;t want them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can use the messages to communicate. For example, in the first message, I could say something like &quot;I want the stick and the towel. You can take the toy and boxes.&quot; But the messages are directly transmitted, so I need to make sure that my messages are clear.<br/><br/>But the problem says that unless it&#x27;s the secret proposal, messages are directly transmitted. So I need to make sure that my messages are not in the secret proposal format. So I can send messages like &quot;I propose to take the stick and towel. You can take the toy and boxes.&quot; But the other player would then have to respond, but since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I need to be concise.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of stick and towel, then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include those. If they propose something else, then we can both get our items. But if they also propose stick or towel, then we get zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, which are my top two. If they don&#x27;t want those, then it&#x27;s good. If they do, then we have a conflict. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes. Since boxes are less valuable to me, but maybe the other player values them more. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the toy. But the toy is only worth 1 to me. Not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and in the messages, suggest that the other player take the toy and boxes. But how to structure that.<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is the key. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player can&#x27;t see it until they make their own. So maybe I should make a secret proposal of the stick and the towel. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, we both get our items. If they do, then we get zero.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of the stick and the boxes. Because boxes are two, and maybe the other player might not want them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then in the messages, ask the other player to take the toy and boxes. But since messages are direct, maybe I can send a message like &quot;I want stick and towel. You can take toy and boxes.&quot; But the other player might not agree, but since it&#x27;s a secret proposal, maybe they have to make their own.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that you can send messages to agree on the division. So maybe the process is that we exchange messages to agree on the division, and then make a secret proposal. Or maybe the secret proposal is an alternative to the messages.<br/><br/>The rules say: &quot;You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.&quot;<br/><br/>So the process is: you can either send messages (up to 5 each) to agree, or make a secret proposal at any time. If you make a secret proposal, that&#x27;s your final offer. If you don&#x27;t, then you have to send messages to agree.<br/><br/>But the problem says that the secret proposal is made in the format with square brackets. So if I make a secret proposal, that&#x27;s my final offer. The other player can then make their own secret proposal, and if they are complementary, we get points.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the stick and the towel, which are my highest value items. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get them. If they do, then we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes. Because boxes are two, and maybe the other player might not want them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then in the messages, suggest that the other player take the toy and boxes. But since messages are direct, maybe I can send that as a message. But the other player might not agree, but since it&#x27;s a secret proposal, maybe they have to make their own.<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is a one-time offer. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player can either accept it (by making a compatible proposal) or reject it. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then we get points. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player makes a secret proposal that is compatible, then we get points. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>So the key is to make a secret proposal that is likely to be compatible with the other player&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Let&#x27;s think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose the stick and the towel, which are my top two items. The other player might value the stick highly as well, or maybe not. If they value the stick, then their proposal might include it, leading to a conflict. If they don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the stick and the boxes. The boxes are two, so maybe the other player might want one or both. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the toy. But the toy is only worth 1 to me. Not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then in the messages, suggest that the other player take the toy and boxes. But since messages are direct, maybe I can send that as a message. But the other player might not agree, but since it&#x27;s a secret proposal, maybe they have to make their own.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of the stick and the towel. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get them. If they do, then we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes. Because boxes are two, and maybe the other player might not want them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the towel, and then in the messages, ask the other player to take the toy and boxes.

But the other player might not agree, but since it&#x27;s a secret proposal, maybe they have to make their own.<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is a one-time offer. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player can either make a compatible proposal or not. If they make a compatible one, we get points. If not, zero.<br/><br/>So the best strategy is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value most, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>So I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal of the stick and the towel. That way, I get the highest value items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get them. If they do, then we get zero.

But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and the boxes. But I think the stick and towel are more valuable to me.<br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with the secret proposal of stick and towel.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 stick, 1 towel, 1 toy, and 2 boxes. My value function is stick:7, towel:3, toy:0, box:0. So I really want the stick and the towel, but the toy and boxes don&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they&#x27;re trying to get certain items. My goal is to propose something that complements their proposal so that both can get their items. If our proposals overlap, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that whatever I propose doesn&#x27;t conflict with theirs.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, how can I decide? Hmm. Maybe I should think about possible scenarios. Let&#x27;s assume that the other player might have proposed items that I also want. For example, if they proposed the stick, then I can&#x27;t take it. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I can take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly but are not too valuable to the other player.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the toy and boxes, which I don&#x27;t care about, then I can take the stick and towel. But if they proposed the stick, then I can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the stick and towel, hoping that the other player didn&#x27;t take them. But if they did, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the stick and something else, but I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that I don&#x27;t know their proposal. So maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are stick and towel. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then we both get them. If it does, then we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the stick, or only the towel, but that might not be optimal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the toy and boxes, then I can take the stick and towel. But if they proposed the stick, then I can&#x27;t. But without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since my value for the stick is 7 and towel is 3, which are higher than the other items, it&#x27;s better to propose those. So I should propose [Proposal: 1 stick, 1 towel]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, we both get them. If it does, then we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best possible proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the stick, but that might not be as good. Let me think. If I propose stick and towel, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, stick and toy, then we can&#x27;t both get stick. So we get zero. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is towel and box, then we can both get stick and towel. So it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance? Not sure. But given that I have to make a proposal, I should go with the items I value the most. So I&#x27;ll propose stick and towel.<br/></p>
