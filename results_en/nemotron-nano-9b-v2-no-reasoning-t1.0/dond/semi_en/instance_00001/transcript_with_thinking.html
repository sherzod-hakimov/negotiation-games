        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 4 magnets, 1 shovel, and 1 flower. My value function is magnet: 0, shovel: 2, flower: 8. So I really want the flower, and the shovel is somewhat valuable, but magnets are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value the flower less than me, or maybe they value the shovel more. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to propose something that&#x27;s likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s proposal, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can just make a secret proposal early. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I should probably start by making a secret proposal.<br/><br/>What should I propose? I want the flower and maybe the shovel. Since I don&#x27;t care about magnets, I can offer them to the other player. But if I take the flower and shovel, that&#x27;s two items. The other player might propose something else. But if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take anything else. But maybe that&#x27;s okay if their proposal is compatible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the flower. Since the flower is worth 8 to me, and maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t want it as much. But if I take the flower, then the other player can take the shovel and magnets. But if their value for the shovel is higher than mine, they might prefer that. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a best guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then I get both. But if they also want the flower, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel, and see if the other player is okay with that.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Since I value the flower highly, I should definitely take it. The shovel is worth 2, which is better than magnets. So maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, I get them. If they do, then maybe we have a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the flower. Because if I take the flower, and the other player takes the shovel and magnets, that&#x27;s possible. But if they also want the flower, then it&#x27;s a problem. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to take the flower and maybe the shovel.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]. That way, I get both items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then it&#x27;s good. If they do, then maybe we have a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the flower. Let me think.<br/><br/>If I propose only the flower, then the other player can take the shovel and magnets. If their value for the shovel is higher than mine, they might take it. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get the flower. But if they also want the flower, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe proposing the flower is better. But then I might miss out on the shovel. However, the shovel is only worth 2, which is less than the flower&#x27;s 8. So maybe it&#x27;s better to take the flower and leave the shovel for the other player.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then I get both. If they do, then maybe we have to split. But since the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then each gets their items. So if both propose the same items, it&#x27;s not complementary. So in that case, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other&#x27;s don&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. So maybe the best is to take the flower and the shovel. Because if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the flower and something else, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get both. Alternatively, if I take only the flower, then the other player can take the shovel and magnets. But if they take the shovel, that&#x27;s okay. But if they take the flower, then conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the flower and the shovel. Let me check the available items. There&#x27;s 4 magnets, 1 shovel, 1 flower. So if I take 1 flower and 1 shovel, that&#x27;s possible. The other player can take the remaining 4 magnets. But if they also want the shovel or flower, then conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the flower. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t want it, I get it. If they do, then conflict. But since the flower is worth 8 to me, it&#x27;s better to take it. So maybe the secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 flower]. That&#x27;s safer. Because if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the flower, I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than risking taking the shovel which is less valuable.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel. Let me think. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the flower and the shovel, then we both get zero. But if their proposal is something else, like the shovel and magnets, then I get both. But if their proposal is the flower and something else, then conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the flower and the shovel. But I&#x27;m not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel, and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, then I get both. If not, then zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. So I&#x27;ll go with that. So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel].<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my own score. The items available are 4 magnets, 1 shovel, and 1 flower. My values are magnet:1, shovel:4, flower:2. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that information, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>The key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the total items requested by both shouldn&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available. For example, if I ask for the shovel and flower, and the other player also asks for those, that&#x27;s a problem because there&#x27;s only one of each. But if I take the shovel and they take magnets, that could work.<br/><br/>My goal is to get the items I value the most. The shovel is worth 4, which is the highest. Then the flower is 2, and magnets are 1 each. So ideally, I want the shovel and maybe some magnets. But I have to consider what the other player might want.<br/><br/>If I propose taking the shovel and the flower, that&#x27;s 4+2=6 points. But if the other player also wants those, we both get zero. Alternatively, if I take the shovel and some magnets, maybe that&#x27;s better. Let&#x27;s think: if I take the shovel (4 points) and maybe one magnet (1 point), total 5. But if the other player takes the flower and some magnets, that could be okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. Since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Maybe I should propose the shovel and the flower. But if the other player also proposed those, it&#x27;s a conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and some magnets. Let me check the available items again: 4 magnets, 1 shovel, 1 flower. <br/><br/>If I take the shovel and one magnet, that&#x27;s 4+1=5. The other player could take the flower and three magnets. That would be 2+3=5. That&#x27;s complementary. So that&#x27;s a possible scenario. Alternatively, if I take the shovel and the flower, and the other player takes four magnets, that&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be compatible. Maybe the safest bet is to take the shovel and the flower. But if the other player also took those, it&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe I should take the shovel and some magnets. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I can&#x27;t know. But maybe I can make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. Let me think about possible combinations. <br/><br/>If I propose the shovel and the flower, that&#x27;s 4+2=6. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 4 magnets, then that&#x27;s okay. But if they also proposed the shovel and flower, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the shovel and one magnet, that&#x27;s 5. The other player could take the flower and three magnets. That&#x27;s 2+3=5. That works. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the shovel and two magnets (4+2=6), and the other player takes the flower and two magnets (2+2=4). That&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Maybe the best approach is to take the shovel and the flower, as they are the highest value items. But I have to be cautious. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, if they proposed the shovel and some magnets, then I need to avoid that. But without knowing, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>Another angle: since the other player made a secret proposal, maybe they are trying to get the shovel. If I also propose the shovel, that could lead to a conflict. So maybe I should avoid the shovel? But that&#x27;s not good because the shovel is worth 4. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and some magnets. But that&#x27;s lower value. <br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe the best strategy is to propose the shovel and the flower. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible, we both get high scores. If not, maybe we can adjust. But since I can only make one proposal, I need to make it as strong as possible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and one magnet. That way, even if the other player takes the flower and three magnets, it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. Since the shovel is the highest value, I should definitely try to get it. So my proposal should include the shovel. Then, maybe add the flower or some magnets. <br/><br/>If I propose the shovel and the flower, that&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 4 magnets, then it&#x27;s okay. If they also proposed the shovel and flower, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the shovel and one magnet, that&#x27;s 5. If the other player takes the flower and three magnets, that&#x27;s 5. That&#x27;s a good split. <br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. <br/><br/>In any case, the best I can do is to propose the shovel and the flower. Let me go with that. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 flower]. <br/><br/>Wait, but the format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]. So I need to specify quantities. For example, &quot;1 shovel, 1 flower&quot;. <br/><br/>Yes. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 flower]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the shovel and two magnets. But that&#x27;s 4+2=6. But if the other player takes the flower and two magnets, that&#x27;s 2+2=4. That&#x27;s also okay. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is the shovel and some magnets. If I also take the shovel, that&#x27;s a conflict. So maybe I should avoid the shovel? But that&#x27;s not good. <br/><br/>This is a bit of a dilemma. Since I can&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s proposal, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible. <br/><br/>Another thought: the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but maybe they are trying to get the shovel. If I also propose the shovel, then if their proposal is also the shovel, we both get zero. But if their proposal is something else, then I can get the shovel. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the flower, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and some magnets. <br/><br/>But given that the shovel is the highest value, I think it&#x27;s worth the risk. So I&#x27;ll go with the shovel and the flower. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 flower].<br/></p>
