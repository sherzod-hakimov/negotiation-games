But since I can&#x27;t know, I should try to maximize my own gain while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible.<br/><br/>The rules<br/>ERROR: Error processing stream</p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge. My value function is hat:4, pen:0, sponge:6. So I really want the sponge and the hat, but pens don&#x27;t matter to me. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s complementary. That means the items I propose should not overlap with what the other player proposes. If we both get what we want, we get points based on our values. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The other player hasn&#x27;t responded yet. My first move is to make a secret proposal. Wait, but the instructions say that unless it&#x27;s the secret proposal, messages are transmitted. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But how?<br/><br/>The secret proposal format is &quot;[Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;object name&gt;, ...]&quot;. So I need to list the items I want. Since I value the sponge and hat, I should propose those. But there&#x27;s only one of each. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 sponge]. That&#x27;s two items. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include these, we can both get them. But if they also want them, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the items I value most. Alternatively, maybe I should propose all items except the pens, since pens are worthless to me. But the other player might want pens. Wait, but if I take the pens, they might not get anything. But since pens are worthless to me, maybe I can give them to the other player. But I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs are complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the sponge and hat, and leave the pens for the other player. But if the other player also wants the sponge or hat, then it&#x27;s a problem. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain. Since the sponge is worth 6 and hat 4, I should definitely take those. The pens are 0, so I don&#x27;t care. So my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 sponge]. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t take those, I get them. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is different. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the sponge, since it&#x27;s higher value. But the hat is also valuable. So including both is better. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. The other player might respond with their own proposal. But since the user hasn&#x27;t responded yet, I should make my secret proposal now. So the first message is the secret proposal. That&#x27;s the best approach. So I&#x27;ll send [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 sponge].<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The items available are 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge. My value function is hat:4, pen:2, sponge:0. So I need to propose items that maximize my score.<br/><br/>First, I should figure out what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. However, since I don&#x27;t have that info, I need to make my own proposal.<br/><br/>The key is to propose items that I value highly. The hat is worth 4 to me, pens are 2 each, and sponge is 0. So I should prioritize the hat and pens. But I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs are complementary. If I take the hat and some pens, but they also need those items, then we might not get any points. So I need to balance between taking high-value items and leaving enough for them to also get something.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know for sure. Maybe they proposed the hat and some pens. If I also propose the hat, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the pens and sponge? But sponge is worthless to me. Alternatively, maybe propose the hat and some pens, but that might conflict with their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they took the sponge (which I don&#x27;t care about), then I can take the hat and pens. But if they took the hat, then I can&#x27;t. Since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Another approach: since I value the hat the most, maybe I should propose the hat. But if the other player also proposed the hat, then we both get zero. So maybe I should propose the pens and sponge. But sponge is 0 for me. Alternatively, maybe propose the hat and some pens, but that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the sponge, then I can take the hat and pens. But if they proposed the hat, then I can&#x27;t. Since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the hat and some pens, but that&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not the hat. Maybe they proposed the pens. Then I can take the hat and sponge. But sponge is 0. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize my score. So I need to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the hat and as many pens as possible. But if they also proposed the hat, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe propose the pens and sponge. But sponge is 0. So maybe propose the hat and some pens. Let&#x27;s say I propose the hat and 2 pens. That would be [Proposal: 1 hat, 2 pens]. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 1 pen and 1 sponge, then we can both get our items. But if they proposed the hat, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose only the hat. [Proposal: 1 hat]. If the other player didn&#x27;t take the hat, then I get 4. If they did, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s better than taking pens. Alternatively, maybe propose 3 pens. [Proposal: 3 pens]. That would give me 3*2=6 points. But if the other player also took pens, then zero. But if they took the hat, then I can get 6. But if they took both hat and pens, then zero. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the hat and 1 pen. [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 pen]. That&#x27;s 4+2=6. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 pens and sponge, then we can both get our items. But if they also took the hat, then zero. But maybe this is a better balance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the hat and 3 pens. But there are only 3 pens. So [Proposal: 1 hat, 3 pens]. That would be 4+6=10. But if the other player also proposed the hat, then we can&#x27;t. But if they didn&#x27;t, then I get 10. But that&#x27;s a big risk. However, since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t be sure. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not the hat. For example, if they proposed the sponge, then I can take the hat and pens. But if they proposed the hat, then I can&#x27;t.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. Since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest way is to propose the hat and some pens. But I need to make sure that my proposal is as valuable as possible. Since the hat is the highest value, I should include it. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 hat, 3 pens]. That&#x27;s 4 + 3*2 = 10. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the hat, then I get 10. If they do, then zero. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do. Alternatively, if I propose only the hat, then if they didn&#x27;t take it, I get 4. But 10 is better. So I think proposing the hat and all pens is the way to go.<br/></p>
