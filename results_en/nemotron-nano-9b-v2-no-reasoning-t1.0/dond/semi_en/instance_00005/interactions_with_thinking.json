                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, and 1 battery. My value function is dice:1, ball:7, glue:0, battery:1. So the ball is super valuable to me, and the dice and battery are less so. Glue is worthless.\n\nThe goal is to maximize my score. Since the other player's value function is secret, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can structure my proposal in a way that even if they don't get the ball, I still get a good deal. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items' values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap on items. But since I don't know their values, I have to propose items that I value and maybe leave some items for them that they might value more.\n\nWait, but I can only send up to 5 messages. The first message is probably my initial proposal. Let me think. If I propose taking the ball and maybe the battery, since those are the highest value items for me. But if I take the ball, that's 7 points. The battery is 1. So total 8. But if I take both, maybe the other player can take the dice and glue. But glue is worthless to me, but maybe they value it. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the ball and battery, and leave the dice and glue for them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and one die, but that might not be as good. Wait, the ball is 7, which is way higher than the others. So taking the ball is crucial. If I can get the ball, that's 7. Then maybe the battery is 1. So total 8. If I can get both, that's good. But if the other player also wants the ball, then we can't both have it. So I need to make sure that my proposal includes the ball, and maybe other items that I value, but not overlapping with what they might want.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the ball and the battery. Then, if they propose something else, maybe they can take the dice and glue. But if they also want the ball, then we can't both have it. So my proposal should be to take the ball and battery. Let me check the format. The secret proposal is in square brackets. So I need to send that as my first message. \n\nWait, the instructions say that unless it's the secret proposal, messages are transmitted directly. So I need to make sure that my first message is the secret proposal. So I should start with \"[Proposal: 1 ball, 1 battery]\". That way, I'm claiming the ball and battery. Then, the other player would have to propose items that don't include the ball or battery. If they do, then the proposals aren't complementary, and we both get zero. But if they propose, say, the two dice and glue, then that's possible. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value function is such that they value the ball more. But since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value. So taking the ball and battery gives me 8. If I can get that, that's good. Alternatively, if I take the ball and one die, that's 1+7=8 as well. But maybe the battery is more valuable to them. But since I don't know, I should take the items I value most. \n\nAnother thought: if I take the ball, that's 7. If I can also get the battery, that's 1. So total 8. If I take the ball and glue, that's 7+0=7. So better to take the battery. So the best proposal for me is ball and battery. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include those items. So if I propose ball and battery, and they propose something else, then it's okay. But if they also propose ball, then it's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the ball. Then, if they take the battery, that's okay. But if they take the ball, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, maybe it's safer to take the ball and battery. \n\nSo my first message should be the secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 battery]. That's my best bet. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust. But since I can only send up to 5 messages, I need to be efficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start with a message to the other player, but the rules say that unless it's the secret proposal, messages are transmitted. But the first message could be a regular message. Wait, the user says \"Let us start.\" So maybe I need to send my first message. But the instructions say that the secret proposal is in square brackets. So I should start with that. \n\nYes, the first message should be the secret proposal. So I'll go with [Proposal: 1 ball, 1 battery]. That way, I'm claiming the most valuable items for me. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then I get 8. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I can't know their values, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the ball. But then I might miss out on the battery. But if the other player takes the battery, that's fine. But if they don't, then I could have taken it. But since I don't know, maybe taking both is better. \n\nSo I think the best first move is to propose the ball and battery. Let me format that correctly.\n"

My value function is dice:0, ball:2, glue:8, battery:0. So I really want the glue, and the ball is okay but not as much. The dice and battery are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they're trying to get certain items. Since I can't see their proposal, I need to make my own that's likely to be complementary. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then both get their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that don't conflict with theirs. But since I don't know their proposal, how can I do that?\n\nHmm, maybe the other player's secret proposal is something that I can infer. But since it's secret, I can't. So perhaps the best approach is to propose items that are valuable to me but not to them. Wait, but I don't know their value function. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in their proposal. But without knowing their proposal, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's secret proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed the glue, which is valuable to me, I need to avoid that. But since I can't see it, maybe I should propose items that are not in their proposal. But how?\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that the items in both proposals don't overlap. So if I propose items that the other player didn't propose, then it's complementary. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a guess. Alternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so I need to make a proposal that's as safe as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's secret proposal is something that I can't know, so I should propose items that are not in their proposal. But without knowing, this is impossible. So perhaps the best strategy is to propose items that are valuable to me, and hope that the other player didn't propose them. For example, if I propose the glue and the ball, which are valuable to me, but if the other player didn't propose those, then we both get them. But if they did, then we get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so I should make a proposal that's as good as possible. Since I value glue the most, I should definitely include that. The ball is next. The dice and battery are worthless. So maybe I should propose glue and ball. But if the other player also proposed those, then we get zero. But if they didn't, then I get both. But since I don't know, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's secret proposal is something that I can't know, so I should make a proposal that's as good as possible. So I should propose the glue and the ball. That's my best bet. If the other player didn't propose those, then I get them. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so I should make a proposal that's as good as possible. So I'll go with glue and ball. Let me check the format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets. So the message would be \"[Proposal: 1 glue, 1 ball]\". That's the format.
