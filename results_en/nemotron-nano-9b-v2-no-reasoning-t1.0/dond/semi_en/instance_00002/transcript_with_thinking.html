    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize my score. The items available are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, and 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:6, berry:0, bowl:1, glass:1. So the shovel is super valuable to me, but berries don&#x27;t matter. The bowl and glasses each give me 1 point each.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I don&#x27;t know it, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to propose items that I value highly and hope they accept or that we can agree on a split.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (enough items for both), we get points based on our own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that includes items I value, and maybe some that the other might value, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>The first step is to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. Since I can only send up to 5 messages, but maybe I can do it in one secret proposal. Let me think about what to propose.<br/><br/>I should propose the shovel because it&#x27;s worth 6 to me. Then maybe some glasses or bowls. But if I take the shovel, the other player might not get it. But if I don&#x27;t take it, maybe they take it and I get nothing. So the shovel is critical for me.<br/><br/>But if I propose the shovel, maybe the other player will counter with something else. However, since I can only send a secret proposal once, I need to make sure my proposal is as good as possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose the shovel and some other items. Let me check the quantities. There&#x27;s 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, 3 glasses. So if I take the shovel, that&#x27;s one item. Then maybe take some glasses. But if I take the shovel, the other player can&#x27;t take it. But if I don&#x27;t take it, they might. So I need to secure the shovel.<br/><br/>But how? Since I can&#x27;t communicate except through messages, and the secret proposal is the only way to lock in items. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the shovel. Let me try that.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 3 glasses]. That&#x27;s two items. But maybe I can take more. Wait, but the other player might also propose items. If my proposal is complementary with theirs, then we both get the items. But if not, we get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. Since the bowl is worth 1 to me. But again, without knowing the other&#x27;s values, it&#x27;s hard. But since I need to maximize my own score, I should focus on items I value.<br/><br/>So the best bet is to take the shovel. If I can get that, I get 6 points. Then maybe take some glasses. But if I take the shovel, the other player can&#x27;t. So maybe my proposal is [Proposal: 1 shovel, 3 glasses]. That would give me 6 + 3*1 = 9 points. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then that&#x27;s good. But if they also propose the shovel, then we can&#x27;t both have it, so we get zero. So I need to make sure my proposal is unique.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. That&#x27;s 6 +1 =7. But again, depends on the other&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the shovel and as many glasses as possible. Because glasses are 1 each, and there are 3. So taking all 3 glasses would add 3 points. So total 9. But if the other player also wants glasses, that could be a problem. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the shovel and some glasses.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. But the bowl is only 1. So 6+1=7. But maybe the other player values the bowl more. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Another thought: since the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, maybe I should propose items that I value highly and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to make it as strong as possible.<br/><br/>So the optimal proposal for me is to take the shovel and as many other items as possible that I value. Since berries are 0, I don&#x27;t care about them. So I should take the shovel, and then maybe the bowl and glasses. But the bowl is 1, glasses are 1 each. So [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl, 3 glasses]. That would be 6 +1 +3 =10. But is that possible? The total items would be 1+1+3=5 items. The total available items are 1+2+1+3=7. So if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t take any of these, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they take any of these, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do. However, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal might take some of these. But since I have to make a secret proposal, I have to commit to it. So I should make the proposal that maximizes my own value, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal might not conflict. But that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the shovel. [Proposal: 1 shovel]. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player doesn&#x27;t take it, then I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But maybe that&#x27;s safer. Because if I take more items, the chance of conflict increases. But if I take only the shovel, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include it, so I can get it. But if they do, then we both get zero. So it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>But since my goal is to maximize my score, I need to take the shovel. So the best proposal is to take the shovel. But maybe also take some other items. However, if I take more items, the other player might also want them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to say.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. Because the bowl is 1 point. So 6+1=7. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and some berries. But berries are 0 to me, so that&#x27;s not helpful. So no.<br/><br/>So the best is to take the shovel. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 shovel]. That&#x27;s 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the shovel, then I get it. If they do, then we both get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose the shovel and some glasses. But again, same problem. But maybe the other player&#x27;s value function doesn&#x27;t value glasses as much. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the safest and most valuable proposal for me is to take the shovel. So I&#x27;ll make that my secret proposal.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 2 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize my score. First, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, wait, the user is simulating the scenario where the other player has already made a proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. But in the given context, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. Without knowing what the other player proposed, how can I decide my own?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the information given. But the other player&#x27;s proposal isn&#x27;t specified here. That&#x27;s confusing. Let me check the problem again. The user says, &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But there&#x27;s no details about what the other player proposed. That&#x27;s a critical missing piece. Without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t determine if it&#x27;s complementary or not. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to make a proposal regardless. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, both get points based on their items. Otherwise, zero. So my proposal needs to be such that it complements the other&#x27;s. But without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t proceed. <br/><br/>Is there a possibility that the other player&#x27;s proposal is not given here, and I need to make a general proposal? Or maybe the user is testing if I can handle the situation where the other&#x27;s proposal is unknown. But that doesn&#x27;t make sense. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to ask for the other player&#x27;s proposal. But according to the rules, I can&#x27;t ask questions; I have to submit a proposal. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the initial setup is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is not provided, and I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But that&#x27;s risky. For example, if I propose items that the other player might not have, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. But without any data, that&#x27;s impossible. <br/><br/>This seems like a problem in the setup. Maybe the user intended to provide the other player&#x27;s proposal but forgot. Since I can&#x27;t proceed without that information, perhaps I should make an assumption. But that&#x27;s not safe. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the previous messages, but in this context, it&#x27;s not shown. Since the user is simulating the game, maybe I should proceed by making a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible, hoping it complements the other&#x27;s. <br/><br/>But given the items available: 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, 3 glasses. My value function is shovel:4, berry:1, bowl:4, glass:0. So I value shovel and bowl highly. <br/><br/>If I make a proposal that includes shovel and bowl, maybe that&#x27;s good. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal also includes those, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that the other player might not want. But without knowing their value function, I can&#x27;t be sure. <br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I have no information about what they value. That complicates things. <br/><br/>In this case, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, in case the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, propose the shovel and bowl. But if the other player also proposed those, then it&#x27;s a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose a mix. But without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so the best I can do is to make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, hoping that the other&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap. <br/><br/>But this is a bit of a dead end. Since the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s proposal, I can&#x27;t make an informed decision. <br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given information, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown. In that case, I should propose items that I value the most, to maximize my own score if the proposals are complementary. <br/><br/>So, my value function is shovel (4), bowl (4), berries (1), glasses (0). So I should prioritize shovel and bowl. <br/><br/>So my proposal could be [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include these, I get them. If it does, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include berries as well, but since they are low value, maybe not. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose all items except glasses, but that&#x27;s risky. <br/><br/>But since I can only send a maximum of 5 messages, but the secret proposal is one message. So I need to make a single secret proposal. <br/><br/>So the best I can do is to propose the items I value most. So [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe include berries if possible. But since they are low value, maybe not. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose 1 shovel, 1 bowl, and 2 berries. But that&#x27;s more items, but if the other player also wants some, it might conflict. <br/><br/>But without knowing the other&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose nothing, but that would result in zero. <br/><br/>So the safest bet is to propose the items I value most. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 shovel, 1 bowl].<br/></p>
