So the risk is that if they also want the frame, we both get zero. But if I don't propose the frame, maybe I can get other items. But since the frame is worth 6, which is much higher than the others, it's better to take the risk.\n\nSo I think the best proposal is to take the frame. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 frame]. That way, if the other player didn't take the frame, I get 6. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I don't know, it's a 50-50 chance. Alternatively, maybe propose the frame and some hammers. For example, [Proposal: 1 frame, 1 hammer]. Then, if the other player didn't take the frame or the hammer, I get 6+1=7. If they took the frame, then we can't. If they took the hammer, then we can't. But maybe that's better. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the shoe and hammers, then I can take the frame. But if they proposed the frame, then I can't. So maybe the best is to propose the frame. But I need to make sure that my proposal is as good as possible. Since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the frame. So I'll go with that.\n",
