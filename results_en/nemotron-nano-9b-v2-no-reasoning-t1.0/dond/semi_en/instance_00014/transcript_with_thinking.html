        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My value function is frame:8, shoe:2, hammer:0. So I really want the frame, a bit the shoe, and don&#x27;t care about hammers.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since I have to maximize my own score, I should assume they might also value the items. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should focus on getting the items I value most.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (no overlapping items), we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, zero. So I need to make sure that whatever I propose doesn&#x27;t conflict with theirs. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might also propose items. So maybe I should propose the frame and shoe, since those are the ones I value. But if they also propose those, then we can&#x27;t both get them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers, but since hammers are worthless to me, that&#x27;s not good. Or maybe just the frame, and let them take the shoe and hammers. But if they take the shoe, I get 8, which is good. But if they take the frame, I get nothing. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe. If they don&#x27;t propose those, then we can both get them. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is when I send a message in the specific format. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me check the rules again.<br/><br/>The secret proposal is when I send a message in the format &quot;[Proposal: ...]&quot;. So if I do that, the other player will see it, and then they can respond. But if I make a secret proposal, they might adjust their own. But since I need to maximize my score, I should propose the items I value most. So the frame is worth 8, shoe 2. So I should propose the frame and maybe the shoe. But if I propose both, and they also propose them, then we can&#x27;t both get them. But if I propose just the frame, then maybe they can take the shoe and hammers. But if they take the shoe, I get 8, which is good. Alternatively, if I propose the frame and shoe, and they don&#x27;t, then I get both. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the frame and shoe. But maybe the other player also values the frame. So maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers, but hammers are worthless. Alternatively, maybe just the frame. Let me think.<br/><br/>If I propose the frame, then the other player can take the shoe and hammers. If they take the shoe, I get 8. If they take the frame, I get nothing. But if I propose the frame and shoe, and they don&#x27;t, then I get both. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know their value function, maybe it&#x27;s safer to propose the frame. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they don&#x27;t value the frame. But I can&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me do that. The secret proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 frame, 1 shoe]&quot;. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, we can both get them. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the frame. Let me think. If I propose the frame, and they propose the shoe and hammers, then we can both get them. But if they propose the frame, then we can&#x27;t. But since I value the frame more, maybe it&#x27;s better to take it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers. But since hammers are worthless, that&#x27;s not helpful. So the best is to propose the frame. So my secret proposal would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 frame]&quot;. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t take the frame, I get it. If they do, then I get nothing. But since I value the frame highly, this is a good move. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe. But if the other player also wants the shoe, then we can&#x27;t. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get both. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>But given that I have to maximize my own score, and the frame is worth 8, which is much higher than the shoe&#x27;s 2, I should prioritize getting the frame. So the best move is to make a secret proposal for the frame. That way, if the other player doesn&#x27;t take it, I get 8. If they do, then I get nothing. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player, but the rules say that messages are transmitted directly, so I need to make sure not to include any response to the rules. So the first message should be a secret proposal. <br/><br/>So I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal for the frame. That&#x27;s the highest value item for me. So the message would be &quot;[Proposal: 1 frame]&quot;.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. I need to figure out what to propose to maximize my score. The items available are 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My values are frame:6, shoe:1, hammer:1. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might have proposed. Since they submitted a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they asked for. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don&#x27;t overlap in items), then we both get the items we asked for. Otherwise, we get nothing.<br/><br/>So my goal is to propose items that the other player isn&#x27;t likely to have in their proposal. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe I can propose items that are less valuable to me but more valuable to them, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, that&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that I have to submit my own proposal now. The other player&#x27;s proposal is already secret, so I can&#x27;t see it. So I need to make a proposal that, given the possible items they might have proposed, maximizes my expected score.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me but low value to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. However, maybe I can assume that the other player&#x27;s values are similar or different. But since I don&#x27;t have that info, perhaps I should focus on my own values.<br/><br/>The frame is worth 6 to me, which is the highest. The shoe and hammers are 1 each. So I should prioritize getting the frame. But if the other player also wants the frame, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the frame, and then maybe some other items. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the frame, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the frame and maybe some hammers or shoes.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, if they proposed the shoe and hammers, then I can take the frame. But if they proposed the frame, then I can&#x27;t. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the safest bet is to propose the frame and maybe some other items. Let me think. If I propose the frame, then if the other player didn&#x27;t propose the frame, we both get it. If they did, then we both get nothing. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should take the risk. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less likely to be in their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the shoe and hammers, then I can take the frame. But if they proposed the frame, then I can&#x27;t. So maybe I should propose the frame and maybe some hammers. But I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap with theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the frame and maybe some other items. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is formatted as [Proposal: ...]. So I need to make sure that my message is in that format. Also, I can send up to 5 messages, but since the other player already made a secret proposal, I need to respond with my own secret proposal.<br/><br/>So the key is to make a proposal that, given the possible items the other player might have, maximizes my chance of getting items. Since I value the frame the most, I should definitely include that. Then, maybe include some hammers or shoes. But if the other player also wants the frame, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the frame and maybe some hammers. Alternatively, maybe propose the frame and the shoe, but that&#x27;s risky if they also want the shoe.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the frame and some hammers. Since there are 3 hammers, maybe the other player might not want all of them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. But since I value hammers at 1 each, maybe it&#x27;s better to take as many as possible. But if the other player also wants hammers, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose the frame and one hammer. Or maybe just the frame.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I propose only the frame, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the shoe and hammers, then we can both get our items. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the frame, then we can&#x27;t. So maybe the best is to propose the frame. But maybe also include some other items to increase the chance that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the shoe and hammers, then I can take the frame. But if they proposed the frame, then I can&#x27;t. So maybe I should propose the frame and maybe some hammers. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe. But if the other player also wants the shoe, then we can&#x27;t. But since the shoe is only worth 1 to me, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the frame and leave the shoe. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the shoe and hammers, then I can take the frame. But if they proposed the frame, then I can&#x27;t. So maybe the best is to propose the frame. But I need to make sure that my proposal is complementary. So if I propose the frame, and the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the frame, then we both get it. If they do, then we get nothing. So the risk is that if they also want the frame, we both get zero. But if I don&#x27;t propose the frame, maybe I can get other items. But since the frame is worth 6, which is much higher than the others, it&#x27;s better to take the risk.<br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is to take the frame. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 frame]. That way, if the other player didn&#x27;t take the frame, I get 6. If they did, then we both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance. Alternatively, maybe propose the frame and some hammers. For example, [Proposal: 1 frame, 1 hammer]. Then, if the other player didn&#x27;t take the frame or the hammer, I get 6+1=7. If they took the frame, then we can&#x27;t. If they took the hammer, then we can&#x27;t. But maybe that&#x27;s better. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed the shoe and hammers, then I can take the frame. But if they proposed the frame, then I can&#x27;t. So maybe the best is to propose the frame. But I need to make sure that my proposal is as good as possible. Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the frame. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>
