Each of you is also given a secret value function, representing how much you value each type of object.\n(b) You exchange messages with the other player to agree on who gets which items. You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received. Otherwise, both of you get zero points.\n(e) Your goal is to maximize the score you receive.\n\nLet us start.\n\nThe set of available items is:\n\n1 pot, 1 candy, 1 whistle, 2 dice\n\nYour secret value function is:\n\npot: 2, candy: 3, whistle: 3, dice: 1\n\nIMPORTANT: Your messages, unless it is the secret proposal, are directly transmitted to the other player, so do not include any response to the rules or text announcing your message. To make a secret proposal, use the indicated format. Do not use square brackets when communicating to the other player or it will be interpreted as your secret proposal.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 whistle, and 2 dice. My value function is pot:2, candy:3, whistle:3, dice:1. So I value candy and whistle the most, then pot, then dice.\n\nThe goal is to maximize my score. Since both players have secret value functions, I don't know what the other player values. But I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (no overlapping items), then we both get the items we asked for. Otherwise, we get nothing.\n\nSo I should propose items that I value highly, but also consider that the other player might have different preferences. Since I can't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. But without info, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe propose items that I value a lot and hope they don't want them. Or maybe split the high-value items between us.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if we both propose items that overlap, we get nothing. So I need to make a proposal that doesn't conflict with the other's. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose items that I value highly and are not too many. For example, I could propose the candy and whistle, which are both worth 3 each. That's a total of 6. But if the other player also wants those, we get nothing. Alternatively, maybe propose the pot and one dice. But pot is 2, dice is 1. That's 3. Not as good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the candy and the whistle. But if the other player also wants those, we lose. But maybe they have different values. For example, if they value pot more, then they might not want candy or whistle. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the pot and the whistle. Pot is 2, whistle 3. Total 5. But again, if they want those, it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the candy and the two dice. Candy is 3, dice 1 each. Total 5. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose just the candy. That's 3. If they don't want it, I get it. But if they do, we lose. But maybe that's a safer bet. Or maybe propose the whistle. Same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose nothing. But that would give me zero. Not good.\n\nWait, but the other player might also be trying to maximize their own score. So they might propose items they value. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since I can't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by others. But without info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose items that I value highly and are unique. For example, the candy and whistle. But if the other player also wants those, we lose. But maybe they have different priorities. For example, if they value pot more, they might not want candy or whistle. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the pot and the candy. Pot is 2, candy 3. Total 5. But again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the whistle and the two dice. Whistle 3, dice 1 each. Total 5. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose just the candy. That's 3. If the other player doesn't want it, I get it. If they do, we lose. But maybe that's a good risk. Or maybe propose the whistle. Same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the pot. 2. But that's lower than candy or whistle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the two dice. 1 each. Total 2. Not great.\n\nHmm. Since I can't know the other's preferences, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and are not too many. For example, candy and whistle. But if they also want those, we lose. Alternatively, maybe propose the candy and the pot. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the candy and the whistle. Let's think: if the other player's value function is such that they don't want those, then I get both. But if they do, we lose. But since I can't know, maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the candy and the whistle. Let me check the items: 1 candy, 1 whistle. So if I propose those, and the other player proposes something else, then we can both get them. But if they also propose those, we lose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the candy and the pot. But again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the candy. That's 3. If the other player doesn't want it, I get it. If they do, we lose. But maybe that's a good risk. Or maybe propose the whistle. Same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the pot and the whistle. 2+3=5. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the two dice. 1 each. But that's low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose nothing. But that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is when I send a message in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should make a secret proposal. But when? The rules say I can send a maximum of 5 messages or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So maybe I can make a secret proposal now.\n\nBut the problem is that the other player might also make a secret proposal. If both make secret proposals, then they are compared. If they are complementary, then both get their items. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut since I don't know the other's secret proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is likely to be accepted. For example, propose items that I value highly and are not too many. For example, [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle]. That's 6 points. But if the other player also proposes those, we lose. But if they propose something else, then I get them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy]. That's 3. If the other player doesn't want it, I get it. If they do, we lose. But maybe that's a safer bet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 whistle]. Same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 2 pot, 1 dice]. 2+1=3. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy, 1 dice]. 3+1=4. But again, same problem.\n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal once, and if I do, the other player might also do the same. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me think.\n\nIf I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle], that's 6. If the other player's secret proposal is different, then we can both get them. But if they also propose those, we lose. But since I don't know their values, maybe this is a good risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy]. That's 3. If the other player doesn't want it, I get it. If they do, we lose. But maybe that's better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 whistle]. Same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 2 pot, 3 candy]. 2+3=5. But again, same issue.\n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal once, and the other player might do the same, I need to choose a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since I value candy and whistle the most, maybe proposing those is better. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle]. Let's go with that. If the other player's proposal is different, then we both get them. If not, we get nothing. But since I can't know, this is a gamble. But maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy]. That's 3. If the other player doesn't want it, I get it. If they do, we lose. But maybe that's a better risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 whistle]. Same.\n\nBut since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose. Let me think about the items. The other player might have different values. For example, if they value pot more, they might not want candy or whistle. But I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle]. That's 6. If the other player's proposal is, say, pot and dice, then we can both get our items. But if they also propose candy and whistle, we lose. But since I can't know, this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy]. That's 3. If the other player doesn't want it, I get it. If they do, we lose. But maybe that's a better risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 whistle]. Same.\n\nBut since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to decide. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If I propose candy and whistle, and the other player proposes something else, I get 6. If they also propose those, we get nothing. If I propose just candy, and they don't want it, I get 3. If they do, we lose. So maybe proposing candy and whistle is better if I can get both. But if they also want them, it's worse. But without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle]. Let's go with that. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 candy, 3 whistle]. That's the best I can do given my value function. I'll send that as my secret proposal.\n",
