    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. My value function is phone:4, mirror:2, fruit:1. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we want to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider that they might have different valuations. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, maybe I should aim for a division that gives both of us items we value, but also considering that if we can&#x27;t agree, we get nothing.<br/><br/>The rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), we get points based on our own valuations. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we each request don&#x27;t overlap in a way that there aren&#x27;t enough. For example, if I ask for the phone and a mirror, and the other person also asks for the phone, that&#x27;s a problem because there&#x27;s only one phone. So we need to split the items without conflict.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal that I think is good. But how do I know what the other player values? Since I don&#x27;t have that info, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also leave some for them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them, but without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get less, if the other player gets more, the total could be higher. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me, but also consider that the other player might have different priorities. However, without that info, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me, but also leave some items for them. For example, if I take the phone (which is worth 4 to me), and maybe one mirror (2) and one fruit (1), total 7. Then the other player could take the remaining mirror and fruit. But if their values are different, maybe that&#x27;s better. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the phone and a mirror, and let them take the rest. Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors, but that might leave nothing for them. But if they can&#x27;t get anything, then the total would be my 4+2+2=8, but if they get nothing, the total is 8. But if they can get some items, maybe the total is higher. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to say.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one mirror, and leave the other mirror and two fruits for them. If they value mirrors and fruits, that could be good. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best is to propose items that are high value to me, but also ensure that there are enough items left for them. For example, if I take the phone (4) and one mirror (2), total 6. Then the other player can take the remaining mirror (2) and two fruits (1 each, total 2). If their values are, say, mirror:3 and fruit:2, then their total would be 3+2+2=7, making the total 6+7=13. But if their values are lower, maybe it&#x27;s worse. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors. That would be 4+2+2=8. Then the other player would have to take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s 2. Total 10. But if they don&#x27;t value fruits, maybe they can&#x27;t get anything. But if they can&#x27;t get anything, then the total is 8. But if they can get the fruits, maybe it&#x27;s better. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one fruit. That&#x27;s 4+1=5. Then the other player can take the two mirrors and one fruit. If they value mirrors highly, that&#x27;s good. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Since the secret proposal is the final offer, maybe I should make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. But how? Since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps the best is to propose items that are high value to me, but also leave some items for them. For example, take the phone (4) and one mirror (2), and leave the other mirror and two fruits. That way, if they value mirrors and fruits, they can take those. Alternatively, maybe take the phone and both mirrors, but that might leave only fruits for them. If they don&#x27;t value fruits, they might not accept. But if they do, then the total is higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the rest. That seems balanced. Let me think about the possible combinations. The items are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, 2 fruits. So if I take the phone and one mirror, the other player can take the other mirror and two fruits. That&#x27;s possible. If I take the phone and both mirrors, the other player can take the two fruits. If I take the phone and one fruit, the other player can take the two mirrors and one fruit. But maybe the best is to take the phone and one mirror, as that&#x27;s a good value for me, and leaves the other mirror and fruits for them. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors. That&#x27;s 4+2+2=8. Then the other player can take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s 2. Total 10. If they don&#x27;t, then they get nothing, but I still get 8. But if they can&#x27;t get anything, then the total is 8. But if they can get the fruits, then 10. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a better proposal. However, if the other player&#x27;s value for fruits is low, they might not accept. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe this is a good approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one mirror. That&#x27;s 6. Then the other player can take the other mirror and two fruits. If they value mirrors and fruits, that&#x27;s 2 + 1*2 = 4. Total 10. If they value mirrors more, maybe higher. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one fruit. 4+1=5. Then the other player can take the two mirrors and one fruit. If they value mirrors, that&#x27;s 2*2=4, plus 1 for the fruit, total 5. So total 10. Same as before.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose the phone and one mirror. That way, I get 6, and they can take the rest. If they value the mirror and fruits, that&#x27;s good. Alternatively, if they value the phone more, but I already took it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors. That&#x27;s 8. Then the other player can take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s 2. Total 10. If they don&#x27;t, then they get nothing, but I still get 8. But if they can&#x27;t get anything, then the total is 8. But if they can get the fruits, then 10. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, maybe the best is to propose items that are high value to me, but also leave some items for them. So the phone is the highest value item for me. So taking the phone is a must. Then, for the mirrors, maybe take one, leaving one for them. And take one fruit, leaving one. But that might not be optimal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, take the phone and both mirrors. That&#x27;s 8. Then the other player can take the two fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s 2. Total 10. If they don&#x27;t, then they get nothing. But if they can&#x27;t get anything, then the total is 8. But if they can get the fruits, then 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, take the phone and one mirror. 6. Then the other player can take the other mirror and two fruits. If they value mirrors and fruits, that&#x27;s 2 + 2 = 4. Total 10. <br/><br/>So in both cases, the total could be 10. But if I take the phone and both mirrors, and they take the fruits, that&#x27;s 8+2=10. If I take the phone and one mirror, and they take the other mirror and two fruits, that&#x27;s 6+4=10. So same total. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for fruits is higher. For example, if they value fruits at 3 each, then taking two fruits would be 6. So total would be 6 (me) + 6 (them) = 12. But I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the phone and one mirror, and they take the other mirror and two fruits. If their value for mirrors is 3 and fruits 2, then their total is 3 + 2*2 = 7. Total 6+7=13. Which is better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose the phone and one mirror. That way, I get 6, and they can take the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors. That&#x27;s 8. Then they take the fruits. If they value fruits, that&#x27;s 2. Total 10. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Since the other player might value the mirrors or fruits. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one mirror. That&#x27;s a good balance. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 mirror]. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player can take the remaining items. The remaining items would be 1 mirror and 2 fruits. So if they can take those, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the phone and both mirrors, then they can take the two fruits. <br/><br/>But which is better? It depends on their values. Since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose the phone and one mirror. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one fruit. But that&#x27;s lower value for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and both mirrors. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, and I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps the best is to propose the phone and both mirrors. Because that&#x27;s the highest value for me, and if they can take the fruits, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But if they can&#x27;t take the fruits, then they get nothing. But if they can, then the total is higher. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the phone and one mirror. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose the phone and one mirror. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 mirror].<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. My values are phone:6, mirror:0, fruit:2. <br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player proposed. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have that information. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user didn&#x27;t provide the content of the other player&#x27;s proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. How can I respond without knowing what they proposed?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate a proposal based on the given information. But without knowing the other player&#x27;s proposal, it&#x27;s impossible to determine if they are complementary. The key is that if both proposals can be fulfilled with the available items, then both get their scores. Otherwise, zero. So my proposal needs to be such that when combined with theirs, the total items required don&#x27;t exceed what&#x27;s available.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers as much as possible of the high-value items for me. Since my phone is worth 6, which is the highest. So I should try to get the phone. The mirrors are worth 0 to me, so maybe I can give those to the other player. Fruits are 2 each, so maybe split them.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t base my response on it. Wait, but in the game, the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I have to make my own proposal without knowing theirs. But the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their scores. So maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, that&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to propose the phone and some fruits, since that&#x27;s what I value. Let me think. If I propose the phone and two fruits, that&#x27;s 6 + 2*2 = 10. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, mirrors and fruits, then maybe we can combine. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Wait, but the user is asking me to submit a proposal. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I have to make my own. The key is that if my proposal and theirs are complementary, then both get their scores. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Given that, maybe I should propose the phone and two fruits. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is mirrors and maybe some fruits, then we can split. Alternatively, if they proposed the phone, then we can&#x27;t both have it. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving room for the other player&#x27;s proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one fruit. That way, if the other player takes the other fruit and mirrors, then we can both get something. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that would give me zero. Not good. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their score. So the best case is that both proposals are possible. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the safest way is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, if I take the phone and two fruits, that&#x27;s 6 + 2*2 = 10. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is mirrors and maybe some fruits, then we can split. But if they also want the phone, then we can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one fruit. That leaves one fruit and two mirrors. If the other player takes the remaining fruit and mirrors, then we can both get something. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a choice. Given that my value for the phone is highest, I should definitely try to get it. So my proposal should include the phone. Then, for the fruits, maybe take one or two. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if I take two fruits, and the other player also takes two fruits, that&#x27;s not possible. So maybe taking one fruit is safer. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one fruit. That way, if the other player takes the other fruit and mirrors, then we can both get something. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 1 fruit]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and two fruits. But that&#x27;s risky if the other player also wants fruits. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. However, the goal is to maximize the sum. So if I can get the phone and some fruits, and the other player gets mirrors and maybe some fruits, that would be good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and two fruits. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is mirrors and one fruit, then we can both get their items. <br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess. However, given the information, I should make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving enough items for the other player. <br/><br/>So, the phone is worth 6, which is the highest. So I should definitely include that. Then, for the fruits, since they are worth 2 each, taking two would give me 4, but if the other player also takes two, that&#x27;s not possible. So maybe take one fruit. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe take two fruits and leave the mirrors for the other player. Since mirrors are worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values them. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 phone, 2 fruits]. <br/><br/>But I need to check if that&#x27;s possible. The available items are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, 2 fruits. If I take 1 phone and 2 fruits, that leaves 2 mirrors. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 mirrors, then that&#x27;s complementary. So both get their items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 1 phone and 1 fruit, then we can&#x27;t both have the phone. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one fruit. That way, if the other player takes the other fruit and mirrors, then we can both get something. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and one fruit. That&#x27;s 6 + 2 = 8. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is mirrors and one fruit, then we can both get their items. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 1 phone and 1 fruit, then we can&#x27;t both have the phone. <br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>In this case, the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which is the phone and as many fruits as possible without overcommitting. <br/><br/>So I think the best proposal is [Proposal: 1 phone, 2 fruits]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is mirrors and maybe some fruits, we can split. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is 1 phone and 1 fruit, then we can&#x27;t both have the phone. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to proceed. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the phone and two fruits.<br/></p>
