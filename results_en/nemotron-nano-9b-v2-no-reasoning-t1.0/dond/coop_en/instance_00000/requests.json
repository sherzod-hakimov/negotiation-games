The items available are 3 rings, 1 dice, and 1 pan. My value function is ring: 0, dice: 4, pan: 6. So I value the pan the most, then the dice, and rings are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since it's a cooperative game, I should assume they have their own preferences. But since I don't know theirs, maybe I should focus on items that are valuable to me and see if there's a way to get them while also getting something they value. But wait, the problem says the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So I need to find a division where both of us get items that are valuable to us, even if we don't know each other's values. But how?\n\nWait, the key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose to take certain items, the other player's proposal must not conflict. For example, if I take the pan, they can't also take it. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope they can take items they value. But how to coordinate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player might propose items they value. But since I don't know their values, perhaps I should propose items that are valuable to me, and maybe they can take the rest. But the problem is that if my proposal and theirs are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items I take and the items they take don't overlap.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and maybe they can take the rest. For example, if I take the pan (which is worth 6 to me), and they take the dice (which is worth 4 to them, assuming they value it). But I don't know if they value the dice. Alternatively, maybe they value the rings. But since I don't know, this is tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I don't know their values, I need to find a division where the total value is maximized. But without knowing their values, how can I do that? Maybe the other player's values are such that they can take items that are valuable to them, but I have to make a proposal that allows for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's values are such that they would prefer certain items. But since I don't have that information, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes items I value, and maybe the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the messages?\n\nThe rules say that I can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But what should I propose?\n\nSince I value the pan the most (6), then the dice (4), and rings (0). So I should try to get the pan and maybe the dice. But if I take both, then the other player can't take them. But if I take the pan, and they take the dice, that would be good. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice. Then, if the other player's proposal is to take the rings, that would be complementary. But if they also want the pan or dice, then it's not complementary. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and hope that they can take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan, and leave the dice and rings for the other player. But if the other player values the dice, that's good. If they value the rings, that's also good. But since I don't know, maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the other player's value function is secret. So I can't know. But the goal is to maximize the sum. So maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value, and the other player can take the rest. For example, if I take the pan (6) and the dice (4), that's 10 for me. Then the other player can take the 3 rings. If they value the rings, that's good. But if they don't, then their score is zero. But since I don't know, maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and leave the dice and rings. Then the other player can take the dice and rings. If they value the dice (4) and rings (maybe they value them), that's better. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice, and the other player can take the rings. That way, if they value the rings, they get something. But if they don't, they get zero. But since the sum is my 10 plus their value of rings. If they value rings, that's good. If not, then their score is zero, but my score is 10. But the total would be 10. Alternatively, if I take only the pan (6), and the other player takes the dice (4) and rings (if they value them), that's 6 + (4 + value of rings). But again, without knowing their values, it's uncertain.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best approach is to take the pan and the dice, and let the other player take the rings. Because if they value the rings, that's good. If not, then their score is zero, but my score is 10. Alternatively, if I take only the pan, and they take the dice and rings, that's 6 + (4 + value of rings). But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nBut since I can't know their values, maybe the safest way is to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player can take the rest. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pan, 1 dice]. Then, if the other player's proposal is to take the 3 rings, that's complementary. Then my score is 6 + 4 = 10, and theirs is whatever they value the rings at. If they value the rings, that's good. If not, they get zero, but the total is 10. Alternatively, if they propose to take the pan, then it's not complementary, and we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player can take the remaining items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the pan and the dice, and the other player can take the rings.

That's the same as before.\n\nBut maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose.

Which is the same as before. But if they value the rings, then the total is higher.

But since I don't know, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes all the items I value, but that might not be possible. Let me think about the items. There are 3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan. My value function is 3 for rings, 1 for dice, 0 for pan. So I would want as many rings as possible. The other player's value function is unknown, but since they made a secret proposal, maybe they have their own preferences.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible. Let me think: if I propose to take all 3 rings and the dice, that's 3 rings (value 9) and 1 dice (value 1), total 10. But if the other player's proposal is, say, to take the pan and the dice, then we can't both have the dice. So that would result in zero. Alternatively, if they proposed to take the pan and some rings, then maybe we can split.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose something that is likely to be compatible. For example, if I propose to take all the rings and the dice, but that might conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the rings and leave the dice and pan for the other player. But if the other player's proposal includes the dice, then we can't both have it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the rings and the pan. But since I don't value the pan, that's not good. Or maybe take the dice and the pan, but that's worse.\n\nWait, but the other player's proposal is secret. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, but also leaves some items for the other player. For example, if I take 2 rings and the dice, then the other player could take 1 ring and the pan. That would be complementary. But I don't know if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. For example, take all 3 rings and the dice. But if the other player's proposal includes the dice, then we can't both have it. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is more balanced. For example, take 2 rings and the pan. But since I don't value the pan, that's not good. Or take 1 ring, 1 dice, and 1 pan. But again, the pan is not valuable to me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take all the rings. That's 3 rings (value 9). Then the other player could take the dice and pan. If their proposal includes those, then we can both get our items. But if their proposal includes the rings, then we can't.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be compatible. Maybe the best approach is to propose to take all the rings. Because that's the highest value for me. If the other player's proposal doesn't include rings, then we can both get our items. If they do, then we get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the dice and the pan. But that's worse for me. So I think the best is to take the rings. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 3 rings, 1 dice]. Wait, but if I take 3 rings and 1 dice, that's 4 items. The other player's proposal might include some of these. But if they proposed, say, 1 ring and 1 pan, then we can both have their items. But if they proposed 3 rings, then we can't.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible. So I'll go with [Proposal: 3 rings, 1 dice]. That's my best bet. If the other player's proposal is compatible, then I get 3*3 +1*1=10, and they get whatever they proposed. If not, we both get zero. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe this is the best approach.\n",

The items available are 3 rings, 1 dice, 1 pan. My value function is ring:3, dice:1, pan:0. So I value rings the most, then dice, then pan which I don't care about.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but in the problem statement, the other player has already submitted a secret proposal. So I need to respond with my own proposal. But how?\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and scores are based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items without overlap, and maximizes the total value.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.
