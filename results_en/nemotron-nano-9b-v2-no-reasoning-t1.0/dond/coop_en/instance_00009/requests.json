My value function is bolt:6, picture:4, egg:0, card:0. So I really want the bolt and the picture. The other player's values are unknown, but since we want the sum of both scores, I should try to get items that are valuable to me and maybe also consider what the other player might value.\n\nThe available items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. Since I value the bolt and picture highly, I should probably try to get those. The egg and cards are worthless to me, so maybe I can give those to the other player if they value them. But since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. However, the goal is to maximize the sum, so even if the other player doesn't value something, if I can get items I value, that's good. But if I take items they value, that's also good for the total.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if our proposals are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that the items we propose don't overlap. So if I take the bolt and picture, the other player can't take those. But if they also want those, then we can't both get them. So maybe I should propose the bolt and picture, and hope the other player proposes something else. Alternatively, maybe I should propose some items and see.\n\nBut since I can send up to 5 messages, but the secret proposal is the final one. The secret proposal is the one that counts. So maybe I should start by sending some messages to negotiate, but since the other player's responses are not known, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bolt and picture, and the other player might propose something else. But if they also propose the same items, then we can't both get them. So perhaps I should propose the bolt and picture, and the other player might propose the egg and cards. But since I don't know their values, maybe they would propose the same items. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bolt and picture, and the other player might propose the same. If that's the case, then we can't both get them, so we get zero.

So first, I need to figure out what the other player's proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don't have that information here. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh, wait, the user is simulating the scenario where the other player has already made a proposal, and now it's my turn. But in the current context, the user hasn't provided the other player's proposal. That's a problem. Without knowing what the other player proposed, I can't make an informed decision.\n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given information. But the other player's proposal is a secret, so I don't have access to it. That's a key point. Since I can't see the other player's proposal, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can handle the situation where the other player's proposal is unknown. But in a real game, the other player's proposal would be known to me. Since this is a simulation, perhaps I need to assume that the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But without that info, I can't proceed. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal that's optimal given the possible scenarios. For example, if the other player's proposal is unknown, I should propose items that are valuable to me but not too much to the other player. But since I don't know their values, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer. But without any data, that's impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is expecting me to make a proposal that's as good as possible, given that I don't know the other's proposal. But in that case, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but not too high to the other. For example, I value cards at 2 each, so maybe propose some cards. But if the other player also values cards, that could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has a secret value function, but I don't know it. So I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose items that are unique or have high value to me. For example, the picture and egg are worth 1 each, and cards are 2. Maybe propose the picture and a card. But if the other player also wants those, it might not be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be wanted by the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that's as comprehensive as possible, but that might not be good if the other player's proposal is similar. \n\nWait, the key is that if the proposals are complementary, both get their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's, covers all items. But since I don't know the other's proposal, I have to make a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don't have that info, perhaps the user is expecting me to make a proposal that's optimal in general. \n\nIn that case, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me. For example, the cards. Since each card is worth 2, and I have 4 cards. If I propose 2 cards, that's 4 points. But if the other player also proposes cards, maybe that's a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a mix of items. For example, the picture and a card. But again, without knowing the other's proposal, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that's as specific as possible. For example, \"Proposal: 1 picture, 1 card\". That way, if the other player's proposal is different, it might be complementary. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Since I can't see the other's proposal, this is a bit of a challenge. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many, so that there's a chance the other player's proposal doesn't overlap. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that's minimal, like just one item, to reduce the chance of conflict. But that might not maximize the sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value. But that's risky. \n\nWait, the items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. My values are bolt:0, picture:1, egg:1, card:2. So the most valuable items are the cards. So maybe I should propose as many cards as possible. But if the other player also wants cards, that could be a problem. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose 2 cards. That's 4 points for me. If the other player's proposal is, say, 2 cards, then we can't both get them. But if their proposal is different, then we can. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 1 card and 1 picture. That's 2 + 1 = 3 points. If the other player's proposal is, say, 1 egg and 1 card, then we can both get them. \n\nBut again, without knowing their proposal, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that's as unique as possible. For example, the bolt is worth 0 to me, so maybe the other player might want it. But I don't care about it. So maybe I should avoid proposing the bolt. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many. For example, 2 cards and 1 picture. That's 2*2 +1 =5 points. If the other player's proposal is, say, 1 egg and 1 card, then we can both get them. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Since I can't see their proposal, I have to make an educated guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that's as comprehensive as possible, but that might not be good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a proposal that's similar to what the other player might propose. But again, without info, it's hard. \n\nIn the absence of specific information, perhaps the best strategy is to propose items that are high value to me and not too many. So, for example, 2 cards and 1 picture. That's 5 points. If the other player's proposal is different, we can both get them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 1 card and 1 egg. That's 2 +1 =3. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Since the user is expecting me to generate a proposal, I'll go with proposing 2 cards and 1 picture. That's a good balance between high value and not too many items. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 2 cards, 1 picture]\n",
