    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My value function is ruler:1, egg:2, battery:3. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we want to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider that the other player might have different preferences. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should aim for a division that gives both of us as much as possible, assuming they might value items similarly or in a way that complements mine.<br/><br/>First, I need to think about possible proposals. Since each can send up to 5 messages, but we can also make a secret proposal at any time. The key is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s proposal, uses all items without overlap. If both proposals are complementary, we get points based on our values. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get less, if the other gets more, the total might be higher. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly but also items that they might value. However, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value the most, but also consider that the other player might have different priorities.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So I can&#x27;t know it. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose items that are unique or have high value for me, but also items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. But again, without knowing their values, this is challenging.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to propose all items, but that&#x27;s not possible because the other player would also need to propose. Wait, no. The proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose certain items, the other player&#x27;s proposal should not overlap. So I need to split the items between us.<br/><br/>Let me list the items again: 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery. Total of 6 items. Each player can take some. The sum of our scores would be the sum of my value for my items plus the other&#x27;s value for theirs. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should aim for a split that maximizes my own value, but also allows the other player to take items they might value. But without knowing their values, this is impossible. So perhaps the best I can do is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value different items. For example, maybe they value rulers more than eggs, or vice versa. But since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that is as good as possible for both.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get less, if the other gets more, the total could be higher. But again, without knowing their values, how can I optimize this?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is similar to mine. If that&#x27;s the case, then splitting the items equally might be good. But I can&#x27;t assume that. However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t give me their values, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that they have similar values, or that the optimal split is to take items that I value highly and leave others for them.<br/><br/>But this is speculative. Let me think of possible proposals. For example, if I propose to take the battery (which I value 3) and maybe some eggs. The other player might take the rulers and eggs. But if I take the battery, that&#x27;s good for me. If the other player takes the rulers, which I value 1 each, but maybe they value them more. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and one egg. That would be 3 + 2 = 5 for me. Then the other player could take the remaining 1 egg and 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1 each, that&#x27;s 3, and the egg at 2, total 5. So total would be 5 + 5 = 10. But if they value rulers more, say 5 each, then their total would be 15 + 2 = 17, which is better. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take all the batteries and eggs, but there&#x27;s only 1 battery and 2 eggs. So I could take 1 battery and 2 eggs. That would be 3 + 2*2 = 7. Then the other player would take 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1 each, that&#x27;s 3. Total 10. But if they value rulers more, say 5 each, then 15, total 22. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. However, if I take too much, maybe the other player can&#x27;t take enough. Wait, but the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose certain items, the other player&#x27;s proposal must not overlap. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don&#x27;t have overlapping items.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes items I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. Since I can&#x27;t communicate, maybe I should make a secret proposal now.<br/><br/>Wait, the user is asking me to start the game. The initial message is from me. So I need to send a message. The rules say that messages are transmitted unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So I can either send a regular message or make a secret proposal.<br/><br/>But the user hasn&#x27;t sent any messages yet. So I need to start. The first message could be a regular message or a secret proposal. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe making a secret proposal now would be better, as it&#x27;s a direct way to propose items without the other player&#x27;s interference.<br/><br/>But what should I propose? Let me think. If I propose to take the battery and maybe some eggs. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 battery, 2 eggs]. That would be 3 + 2*2 = 7 for me. Then the other player would need to propose the remaining items: 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1 each, that&#x27;s 3. Total 10. If they value rulers more, say 5 each, then 15, total 22. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the battery and one egg. Then the other player could take the remaining egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 = 5. Total 7 + 5 = 12. That&#x27;s better than 10. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the battery and no eggs, just the battery. Then the other player could take 3 rulers and 2 eggs. If they value rulers at 1 and eggs at 2, that&#x27;s 3 + 4 = 7. Total 3 + 7 = 10. But if they value eggs more, say 5 each, then 10 + 3 = 13. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take all the items. But that&#x27;s not possible because the other player would also need to propose. Wait, no. If I propose all items, then the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be empty, but that&#x27;s not allowed? Or maybe they can propose nothing. But the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that together they cover all items without overlap. So if I propose all items, the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be empty, which is allowed? Or maybe not. The problem says &quot;there are enough items to fulfill both proposals&quot;. So if I propose all items, the other player&#x27;s proposal would have to be empty, which is allowed. But then the other player&#x27;s score would be zero. So the total would be my value (3 + 2*2 = 7) plus zero, which is 7. That&#x27;s worse than other options.<br/><br/>So proposing all items is bad. So I need to split the items. So maybe the best is to take the battery and some eggs, and leave the rulers for the other player. But how many eggs?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the battery and one egg. Then the other player can take the remaining egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 = 5. Total 7 + 5 = 12. If they value the egg more, say 5, then 5 + 3 = 8, total 15. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the battery and both eggs. That&#x27;s 3 + 2*2 = 7. The other player takes 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 3. Total 10. If they value rulers at 5, 15. Total 22. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best I can do is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. So maybe the best is to take the battery and one egg. That way, I get 3 + 2 = 5. The other player can take the remaining egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 = 5. Total 10. If they value the egg more, say 5, then 5 + 3 = 8. Total 13. If they value rulers more, say 5 each, 15 + 2 = 17. Total 22. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and no eggs. Then the other player can take 3 rulers and 2 eggs. If they value rulers at 1 and eggs at 2, that&#x27;s 3 + 4 = 7. Total 3 + 7 = 10. If they value rulers more, say 5 each, 15 + 4 = 19. Total 22. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 1 ruler. That would be 3 + 1 = 4. The other player takes 2 rulers, 2 eggs. If they value rulers at 1 and eggs at 2, that&#x27;s 2 + 4 = 6. Total 10. If they value rulers more, say 5 each, 10 + 4 = 14. Total 18. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest is to take the battery and as many eggs as possible. Because the battery is the highest value for me. So taking the battery and 2 eggs would give me 3 + 4 = 7. Then the other player takes 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 3. Total 10. If they value rulers more, say 5, 15. Total 22. But again, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 1 egg. That&#x27;s 3 + 2 = 5. The other player takes 1 egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 = 5. Total 10. If they value the egg more, say 5, then 5 + 3 = 8. Total 13. If they value rulers more, 15 + 2 = 17. Total 22. So this seems like a balanced approach.<br/><br/>But how do I decide? Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. For example, if I take the battery and 1 egg, and the other player takes the remaining egg and 3 rulers. That way, all items are distributed. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 battery, 1 egg]. Then the other player would need to propose the remaining items. If they do, then the total would be my value (5) plus their value (depending on their function). But since I don&#x27;t know their function, I can&#x27;t optimize for that. However, the problem states that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get less, if the other gets more, the total could be higher. But without knowing their values, I can&#x27;t calculate that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the same items as me. If that&#x27;s the case, then splitting the items equally would be good. But again, I can&#x27;t assume that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is the opposite. For example, they value rulers more than eggs. But again, no info.<br/><br/>In the absence of information, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the battery and one egg. That way, I get 5, and the other player can take the remaining egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, total is 10. If they value the egg more, it&#x27;s better. If they value rulers more, it&#x27;s better. So this seems like a reasonable proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 2 eggs. That&#x27;s 7. The other player takes 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1, total 10. If they value rulers at 5, total 22. But if they don&#x27;t value rulers, maybe they take nothing, but that&#x27;s not possible. Wait, the other player would have to propose something. If I take all the eggs and battery, the other player would have to take the rulers. So their proposal would be 3 rulers. If they value them, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe they don&#x27;t take them, but the problem says that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I take all the eggs and battery, the other player&#x27;s proposal must not overlap. So they can take the rulers. So their proposal would be 3 rulers. If they value them, then total is 7 + (3*their value for ruler). If their value for ruler is 1, total 10. If it&#x27;s 5, 22. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal is also good. So I&#x27;ll go with the battery and 1 egg. That&#x27;s 5 for me. The other player can take the remaining egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, total 10. If they value the egg more, better. If they value rulers more, better. So this seems like a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 2 eggs. That&#x27;s 7. The other player takes 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1, total 10. If they value rulers at 5, 22. But if they don&#x27;t value rulers, maybe they don&#x27;t take them. But the problem says that the proposals must be complementary. So if I take all the eggs and battery, the other player must take the rulers. So their proposal would be 3 rulers. If they don&#x27;t value them, they might not take them, but the problem says that the proposals are submitted. So even if they don&#x27;t value them, they have to propose. So if they propose 3 rulers, and I propose 1 battery and 2 eggs, then the proposals are complementary. So the total would be my 7 plus their value for 3 rulers. If their value for ruler is 1, total 10. If it&#x27;s 5, 22. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the battery and 2 eggs. That way, I get the highest possible value for myself, and the other player gets the rulers. If they value rulers, that&#x27;s good. If not, maybe they don&#x27;t, but the problem says that the proposals are submitted. So even if they don&#x27;t value them, they have to propose. So the total would be my 7 plus their value for 3 rulers. If their value is 1, total 10. If it&#x27;s higher, better. So this might be better than taking 1 egg.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 1 egg. That way, the other player can take 1 egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, total 10. If they value the egg more, say 5, then 5 + 3 = 8. Total 13. If they value rulers more, 15 + 2 = 17. Total 22. So this seems like a better balance.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. Maybe the best is to make a secret proposal now. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 battery, 1 egg]. That&#x27;s my proposal. Then the other player would have to propose the remaining items. If they do, then the total would be my 5 plus their value for 1 egg and 3 rulers. If their values are similar to mine, that&#x27;s 2 + 3 = 5, total 10. If they value the egg more, better. If they value rulers more, better. So this seems like a reasonable proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 2 eggs. That&#x27;s 7. The other player takes 3 rulers. If they value rulers at 1, total 10. If they value rulers at 5, 22. But if they don&#x27;t value rulers, maybe they don&#x27;t take them. But the problem says that the proposals must be complementary. So if I take all the eggs and battery, the other player must take the rulers. So their proposal would be 3 rulers. If they don&#x27;t value them, they might not take them, but the problem says that the proposals are submitted. So even if they don&#x27;t value them, they have to propose. So the total would be my 7 plus their value for 3 rulers. If their value is 1, total 10. If it&#x27;s higher, better. So this is a gamble.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the battery and 1 egg. That way, the other player can take the remaining egg and 3 rulers. If they value the egg at 2 and rulers at 1, total 10. If they value the egg more, better. If they value rulers more, better. So this seems like a balanced approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the battery and 0 eggs. Then the other player can take 2 eggs and 3 rulers. If they value eggs at 2 and rulers at 1, that&#x27;s 4 + 3 = 7. Total 3 + 7 = 10. If they value eggs more, say 5 each, 10 + 3 = 13. If they value rulers more, 15 + 2 = 17. So again, similar to before.<br/><br/>But I think taking the battery and 1 egg is a good middle ground. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>

So first, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t have the details here. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user&#x27;s message: &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But the user didn&#x27;t include the actual proposal. That&#x27;s a problem. Without knowing what the other player proposed, how can I make a strategic response?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to outline my strategy regardless of the other&#x27;s proposal? Or perhaps there&#x27;s a missing part in the input. Let me check again. The user provided the items and my value function, then mentioned that the other player submitted a secret proposal. But the actual content of that proposal isn&#x27;t given. That&#x27;s a critical missing piece. Without knowing what the other player is asking for, I can&#x27;t determine if my proposal is complementary or not.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe this is a test where I need to simulate the process. But in a real game, the other player&#x27;s proposal would be known. Since the user hasn&#x27;t provided it, perhaps I should ask for clarification. But according to the problem setup, I need to proceed as if I have to make a proposal now. Maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I have to infer or perhaps it&#x27;s a standard case. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to generate a proposal based on my value function and the items available, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown but I need to make a strategic move.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player&#x27;s proposal is part of the initial setup that I should have known. Wait, no. The problem states that the other player has submitted a secret proposal, which I need to respond to. But without knowing what that proposal is, I can&#x27;t proceed. This seems like a flaw in the problem setup. However, maybe in the context of this exercise, I should proceed by making a proposal that maximizes my own value while considering possible complementary proposals.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can deduce based on their value function. But since I don&#x27;t have access to their value function, that&#x27;s not possible. The problem only gives me my own value function. So this is a bit of a puzzle. <br/><br/>Wait, perhaps the key is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but I need to make my own proposal in a way that maximizes the sum. Since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, hoping that they also value them, or propose items that they might value. But without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all items that I value, and see if the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. But since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, this is a bit of a gamble. However, the goal is to maximize the sum, so perhaps I should propose items that I value, and if possible, items that the other player might also value. <br/><br/>Looking at my value function: rulers are worth 3 each, eggs 0, battery 1. So I value rulers the most. The available items are 3 rulers, 2 eggs, 1 battery. So I should probably try to get as many rulers as possible. If I propose all 3 rulers and the battery, that&#x27;s 3*3 +1 =10 for me. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes some of these, we might not be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a subset that leaves items for the other player. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, but also leaves some items for them. For example, if I take all 3 rulers and the battery, that&#x27;s 4 items. The other player might have proposed some items. If their proposal includes, say, 2 rulers and 1 egg, then combining would require 3+2=5 rulers (but there are only 3), so it&#x27;s not complementary. So both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 2 rulers and the battery, and the other proposes 1 ruler and 2 eggs, then total rulers would be 3, eggs 2, battery 1. That works. So my score would be 2*3 +1=7, theirs would be 1*3 + 2*0=3. Total sum 10. <br/><br/>But without knowing their proposal, I can&#x27;t be sure. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a minimal set that I can get, but that might not maximize the sum. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they have a secret proposal, maybe they are also trying to get high-value items. But without knowing their value function, it&#x27;s impossible. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the other player has a secret value function, but I don&#x27;t know it. So I can&#x27;t base my proposal on their preferences. <br/><br/>In this case, perhaps the best strategy is to propose all the items I value, which are the rulers and the battery. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 3 rulers, 1 battery]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, I get those items. If not, we both get zero. But since I want to maximize the sum, maybe this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose fewer items to leave some for the other player. For example, if I propose 2 rulers and the battery, then if the other player proposes 1 ruler and 2 eggs, that&#x27;s complementary. My score would be 2*3 +1=7, theirs 1*3 + 2*0=3. Total 10. If I had proposed all 3 rulers and battery, and they proposed 0 rulers and 2 eggs, then it&#x27;s complementary. My score 10, theirs 0. Total 10. But if they proposed 3 rulers and 1 battery, then it&#x27;s not complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s a risk. However, given that I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the maximum I can get, which is 3 rulers and 1 battery. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can&#x27;t know, so I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. <br/><br/>So my final proposal would be [Proposal: 3 rulers, 1 battery]. That&#x27;s the best I can do given my value function. I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>
