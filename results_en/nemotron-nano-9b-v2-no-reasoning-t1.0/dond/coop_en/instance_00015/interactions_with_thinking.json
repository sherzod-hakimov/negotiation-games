                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer. My value function is statue:3, nail:1, hammer:0. So I value statues the most, then nails, and hammers are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, I need to consider what they might value. But since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should assume they have different priorities. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), then each gets their items and their scores are based on their own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we propose don't overlap in a way that requires more than what's available.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is the final offer. So maybe I should try to propose something that covers as much as possible of the items I value, while leaving enough for the other player to also get some items they value. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. Wait, but the problem says that the other player also has a secret value function. But since I don't know it, maybe I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player can take the rest. But if their value function is such that they don't value the remaining items, then maybe the total score would be lower. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps I should propose items that I value, and leave the rest for the other player, assuming they can take them. But if their value function is such that they don't value the remaining items, then maybe the total would be lower. However, since I don't have that information, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, and see if the other player can take the rest. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a split that covers all items, but that might not be possible. Let me think.\n\nThe items are 3 statues, 1 nail, 1 hammer. If I propose to take all 3 statues and the nail, that's 4 items. Then the other player would need to take the hammer. But if the other player values the hammer, then that's good. But if they don't, then maybe they can't take it. But since I don't know their value function, maybe I should propose the items I value, and let them take the rest. Alternatively, maybe I should propose a split that includes some items they might value. But without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is the final offer. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player can either accept or reject. But the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then they get their items. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player's proposal would need to be complementary. But since I can't know their proposal, maybe making a secret proposal is risky. Alternatively, maybe I should send messages to negotiate. But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I need to figure out what to say.\n\nWait, the rules say that I can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So maybe I should first send some messages to the other player to figure out their preferences. But since I don't have any information about their value function, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe I should just make a secret proposal. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the statues and the nail, and leave the hammer for the other player. Since I value statues and nails, and the hammer is worthless to me. If the other player values the hammer, then that's good. If not, then maybe they can't take it, but since the hammer is only one, maybe they can take it. But if their value function is such that they don't value the hammer, then they might not take it, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then they get their items. So if I propose [3 statues, 1 nail], and the other player proposes [1 hammer], then that's complementary. But if the other player's proposal is something else, like [1 nail, 1 hammer], then that would conflict with my proposal. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take all the items I value, and leave the rest. So my secret proposal would be [3 statues, 1 nail]. Then the other player's proposal would need to be [1 hammer] to be complementary. If they do that, then I get 3*3 + 1*1 = 10, and they get 1* their value for hammer. But if their value for hammer is, say, 5, then total is 15. If their value is 0, then total is 10. But since I don't know, maybe this is the best I can do. Alternatively, if I propose to take the statues and the hammer, but since I value hammer 0, that's worse. So better to take the nail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the nail and the hammer, but that's worse for me. So the best is to take the statues and the nail. So my secret proposal would be [3 statues, 1 nail]. Then the other player's proposal would need to be [1 hammer] to be complementary. If they do that, then the total is my 10 plus their value for hammer. If they don't, then both get zero. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is compatible. But without knowing their value function, it's a gamble. However, since the problem is a cooperative game, maybe the other player is also trying to maximize the sum. So perhaps they would accept my proposal if it's beneficial for them. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask about their preferences. But the problem says that messages are directly transmitted, so I can't ask questions. Wait, the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, so I can send messages to the other player. But the user hasn't provided any previous messages. So maybe I should start by sending a message. But the user's instruction says that unless it's the secret proposal, messages are directly transmitted. So maybe I should send a message to the other player. But what to say? Since I don't know their value function, maybe I can't. Alternatively, maybe I should just make a secret proposal. \n\nBut the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of [3 statues, 1 nail], then the other player's proposal would need to be [1 hammer] to be complementary. If they do that, then I get 3*3 + 1*1 = 10, and they get their value for the hammer. If their value for hammer is, say, 2, then total is 12. If they don't, then both get zero. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is compatible. But since I can't know, maybe this is the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the nail and the hammer, but that's worse for me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the nail and leave the hammer. But that's the same as before. So I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal of [3 statues, 1 nail]. That way, I get the maximum value for myself, and the other player can take the hammer. If they value the hammer, then the total is higher. If not, then maybe they can't take it, but since the hammer is only one, maybe they can. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the nail and the hammer, but that's worse for me. So no. So I think the best is to propose [3 statues, 1 nail]. So I'll make that my secret proposal.\n"

The items available are 3 statues, 1 nail, and 1 hammer. My value function is statue:0, nail:1, hammer:9. So I really want the hammer, and the nail is worth a little, but statues don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe they're trying to get certain items. Since I need to respond with my own proposal, I should think about what items I can take that would maximize the total value. Since the total score is the sum of both players' values, I should aim for a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items or at least the valuable ones.\n\nWait, but if our proposals are complementary, meaning they don't overlap in items, then we can both get their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn't conflict with theirs.

If I can get the hammer, that's great. The nail is 1, so maybe not worth fighting over. The statues are 0 for me, so maybe the other player might want them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can complement.

But I need to make sure that my proposal is in the correct format. The secret proposal should be in square brackets. So the message would be \"[Proposal: 1 hammer, 1 nail]\" or something like that. But I need to check the exact format. The example given is \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, ...]\".
