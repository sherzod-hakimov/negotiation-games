The items available are 1 pen, 1 flower, and 3 frames. My value function is pen:4, flower:0, frame:2. So I really want the pen, and frames are okay but not as good. The flower is worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me but maybe not to them, or vice versa. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items I propose and the items the other player proposes don't overlap.\n\nBut since I don't know their value function, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that they don't propose the same. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value less, so that they can take the ones they value more. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get a high score, if the other player's score is low, the total might not be optimal. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and assume that they might propose items they value.

So maybe I should propose items that I value, but maybe not the ones they might want. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen, since it's the most valuable to me.

But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frames, since they are less valuable to me. If I propose frames, maybe the other player can take the pen and flower, which they might value more. But again, without knowing their values, it's a guess.\n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has a secret value function. So I need to make a proposal that, given their possible values, maximizes the total. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value, and hope that they don't propose the same. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and frames, and the other player might propose the flower. But if they propose the flower, which I don't value, but maybe they do. If they do, then we can have a total of pen (me) and flower (them), which would be good. But if they propose the pen, then we both get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the flower. But since the flower is worthless to me, maybe that's not good. But if the other player values the flower, then they might take it. But again, without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the frames. Let me think.

But if they don't propose the pen, then I get the pen, and they get the rest. But since I don't know their values, maybe the best is to propose the pen, and hope they don't. But if they do, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's value for the pen is low, so they might not propose it. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frames.

If the other player proposes the frames, then we can have pen (me) and flower (me) and frames (them). But since the flower is worthless to me, that's not good. But if the other player values the flower, then they might take it. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen. Let me think. If I propose the pen, and the other player proposes the flower and frames, then the total is 4 (me) + (their value for flower + their value for frames). If their value for flower is high, that's good. But if they don't propose the pen, then I get it. But if they do, then we both get zero. So the risk is that if they also want the pen, we both lose. But maybe the other player's value for the pen is low, so they might not propose it. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the frames. If the other player proposes the flower, then we can have pen (me) and frames (me) and flower (them). But if they propose the pen, then we both get zero. But if they don't, then I get pen and frames, and they get the flower. But if they don't value the flower, then their score is zero, but mine is 4+2=6. But the total would be 6. If they do value the flower, then their score is their value for flower, which could be higher. But again, without knowing, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pen]. Then, if the other player doesn't propose the pen, I get it. If they do, we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the frames. But then if they propose the pen, we both get zero. But if they don't, I get both. But maybe that's better. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the flower. But since the flower is worthless to me, that's not helpful. Unless the other player values it. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 pen]. That way, if the other player doesn't propose the pen, I get it. If they do, we both get zero. But maybe that's the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the frames. But then if they propose the pen, we both get zero. But if they don't, I get both. But maybe that's better. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and the frames.

So the risk is that if they want the pen, we both lose. But if they don't, I get both. But since I don't know their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen. That's the safest bet. Because if I get the pen, I get 4, and the other player can take the flower and frames. If they value the flower and frames, then the total is 4 + (their value for flower + their value for frames). If they don't, then they get nothing, but I still get 4. But if they also want the pen, then we both get zero. But maybe the other player's value for the pen is low, so they might not propose it. So I'll go with proposing the pen.\n"

The items available are 1 pen, 1 flower, and 3 frames. My value function is pen:2, flower:5, frame:1. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the other player's proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don't have that information. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user's message: \"The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.\" But the user didn't provide the content of the other player's proposal. That's a problem. How can I respond without knowing what they proposed?\n\nWait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate my own proposal based on the information given. But the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, we get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's, covers all items without overlap. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers all items, but that's not possible because there are 1 pen, 1 flower, 3 frames. If I take all, then the other player can't take anything. But that would result in both getting zero. Alternatively, maybe split the items.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, perhaps I should make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. For example, take the flower (which is high value for me) and some frames. But I need to think about what the other player might have proposed. Since I don't have that info, maybe I should make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something I need to respond to. But without knowing their proposal, I can't adjust. Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given info, assuming that the other player's proposal is unknown. But that's not possible. \n\nWait, maybe the initial setup is that the other player's proposal is already given, but in the problem description, the user hasn't provided it. That's confusing. Maybe this is a test scenario where I need to create a proposal. Let me think. The key is that the proposals must be complementary. So if I propose items that the other player didn't take, and vice versa, then we can both get points. \n\nSince I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me. For example, the flower (value 5) and maybe some frames. But if I take the flower, the other player might have taken it, but since it's a secret proposal, I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all items, but that would mean the other player can't take anything, leading to zero. So that's bad. Alternatively, propose a subset. \n\nWait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get some items and the other player can get the rest, that's better. For example, if I take the flower (5) and a frame (1), and the other player takes the pen (2) and two frames (1 each), then total sum is 5+1 + 2+1+1 = 10. But if I take the flower and pen, and the other takes frames, that's 5+2 + 3*1 = 10. Either way, same total. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose the flower and some frames. Let me check the value. My value for flower is 5, which is the highest. So taking the flower is good. Then, maybe take one frame. But if the other player also takes a frame, that's a conflict. But since it's a secret proposal, maybe they didn't take it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the flower and the pen. That would be 5+2=7 for me. Then the other player could take the three frames (3*1=3). Total sum 10. That's good. \n\nBut if I propose the flower and pen, and the other player's proposal is, say, the flower and frames, then there's a conflict on the flower. So both get zero. That's bad. \n\nSo the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that are unique or have high value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something I can infer. But without that info, I can't. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given info, assuming that the other player's proposal is unknown. So I need to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of being complementary. \n\nIn that case, perhaps I should propose the flower (high value) and maybe some frames. Let me think. If I take the flower and one frame, then the other player could take the pen and two frames. That would be complementary. My score would be 5+1=6, theirs 2+2=4. Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the flower and two frames, then the other player could take the pen and one frame. My score 5+2=7, theirs 2+1=3. Total 10. \n\nEither way, the total is 10. But if I take the flower and pen, and they take frames, that's 5+2 + 3*1=10. \n\nSo maybe the best is to take the flower and pen. But if the other player also took the flower, then it's a conflict. But since it's a secret proposal, I can't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something else. But without that info, I have to make a best guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is not known, so I should make a proposal that covers as much as possible. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose the flower and the pen, since those are the highest value items for me. That way, even if the other player takes the frames, we both get points. \n\nSo my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 pen]. \n\nBut I need to check if that's allowed. The format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe take the flower and two frames. But that's 5+2=7. If the other player takes the pen and one frame, that's 2+1=3. Total 10. \n\nBut if the other player's proposal is, say, the flower and pen, then we both get zero. \n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don't have that info, I need to proceed. \n\nIn conclusion, I should propose the flower and pen, as they are the highest value items for me. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include those, we can both get points. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 pen].\n"
