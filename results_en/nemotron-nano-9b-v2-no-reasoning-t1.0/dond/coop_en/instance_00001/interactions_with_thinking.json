                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads. My value function is bell:1, doll:2, thread:3. The other player's value function isn't given, but since we want to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider that the other player might have different preferences. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should aim for a division that gives both of us items we value, but also considering that the other player might value some items more.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their items and their scores are based on their own values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the combined proposals don't exceed the available items. Since I don't know the other player's values, but my goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, I need to find a division where the total value (my value plus theirs) is as high as possible. But without knowing their values, this is tricky. However, maybe I can assume that the other player's values are similar or that they might value certain items more. Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and hope the other player can take the rest, but that might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, since the other player's values are secret, perhaps the best strategy is to propose items that I value the most, and then the other player can take the remaining items. But I need to make sure that the total items in both proposals don't exceed the available quantities. Let me check the available items again: 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads. So total items are 2+1+2=5 items. Each player can take some of these.\n\nIf I propose, say, 1 bell and 1 thread, that's 2 items. Then the other player could take 1 bell, 1 doll, and 1 thread. But I need to make sure that the total doesn't exceed the available. Let me think. If I take 1 bell and 1 thread, then the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll, and 1 thread. That would use up all items. But I need to check if that's possible. The total bells would be 1 (me) +1 (other) = 2, which is available. Dolls: 1 (other) is available. Threads: 1 (me) +1 (other) = 2. So that works. Then my score would be 1 (bell) +3 (thread) =4. The other player's score would be 1 (bell) +2 (doll) +3 (thread) =6. Total sum is 10. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 bells and 1 doll, that's 3 items. Then the other player could take 2 threads. But then my score would be 2*1 +2 =4, and the other player's score would be 2*3=6. Total 10 again. Same total. Or if I take 1 doll and 2 threads, that's 3 items. Then the other player could take 2 bells. My score would be 2 + 2*3=8, and the other player's 2*1=2. Total 10. Still same. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe the other player's values are different. For example, if the other player values bells more, then taking bells would be better. But since I don't know, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the messages?\n\nThe rules say that I can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But the problem says that the other player is also making a secret proposal. So if both proposals are complementary, then we get the scores. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. But how to ensure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set of items that I value, and then the other player can propose the remaining items. But since I can't see their proposal, I need to make sure that my proposal is such that there's enough items left for them. But without knowing their proposal, it's hard. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So maybe the best way is to propose items that I value, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't overlap. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose a set that is as valuable as possible, and the other player can take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that is complementary to what the other player might propose. But again, without knowing their values, it's challenging.\n\nWait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if the other player's values are unknown, the total value would be the sum of my value for my items plus their value for their items. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should assume that they value items similarly, or that they might value certain items more. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. For example, if I take 1 bell and 1 thread (value 1+3=4), then the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll, and 1 thread (value 1+2+3=6). Total 10. Alternatively, if I take 2 threads (value 6), then the other player can take 2 bells and 1 doll (value 2*1 +2=4). Total 10 again. So same total. So maybe any division that uses all items would give a total of 10. But maybe there's a way to get more?\n\nWait, but the total value of all items is 2*1 (bells) +1*2 (doll) +2*3 (threads) = 2 +2 +6=10. So the maximum possible total is 10. So any division that uses all items would give that. So the key is to make sure that both proposals are complementary, i.e., they don't overlap in items. So if I propose items that I take, and the other player proposes the remaining items, then the total is 10. So the goal is to make sure that both proposals are complementary. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that is a subset of the items, and the other player's proposal is the complement. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes items I value highly, and then the other player can take the rest. For example, if I propose 1 bell and 1 thread, then the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll, and 1 thread. That would be complementary. But if the other player's proposal is different, maybe they might not. But since I can't know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and hope that the other player's proposal is the complement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes all items I value, but that's not possible because the other player also needs to take some. Wait, but if I take all items, then the other player can't take any, so their proposal would be empty, which would not be complementary. So that's bad. So I need to leave some items for the other player.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to propose a subset of items that I value, and the other player's proposal would be the remaining items. But since I don't know their values, I need to maximize my own value plus the other's value. But without knowing their values, maybe I should assume that they value items similarly. For example, if I take 1 bell and 1 thread (value 4), and the other player takes 1 bell, 1 doll, 1 thread (value 6), total 10. Alternatively, if I take 2 threads (value 6), and the other player takes 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4), same total. So either way, the total is 10. So maybe any division that uses all items is optimal. Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that is a subset of the items, and the other player's proposal is the complement. But how to ensure that?\n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal, and the other player does the same, I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap. But since I can't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and the other player's proposal would be the rest. But how to structure the messages?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by sending a message to the other player, but the rules say that messages are directly transmitted, and the secret proposal is in the specific format. So maybe I should first make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, then the other player would also make a secret proposal. If they are complementary, then we get the scores. Otherwise, zero. So the best is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player would propose items they value highly. But without knowing their values, it's hard. However, since the total value is fixed at 10, any division that uses all items would give that. So the key is to make sure that both proposals are complementary. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that is a subset of the items, and the other player's proposal is the complement. But since I can't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and the other player's proposal would be the rest.

For example, if I propose 2 threads (value 6), and the other player proposes 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4), total 10. That's good. Alternatively, if I propose 1 doll and 2 threads (value 2+6=8), and the other player proposes 2 bells (value 2), total 10. So same. So any division that uses all items is optimal.

For example, if I propose 2 threads (value 6), and the other player proposes 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4), that's good. But if the other player proposes something else, like 1 bell and 1 doll (value 1+2=3), then my proposal would be 2 threads (6), and their proposal would be 1 bell and 1 doll (3), but that's only 3 items, leaving 1 bell and 1 thread. So that's not complementary. So in that case, both get zero. So that's bad. Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that is complementary to what the other player might propose. But without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that is as valuable as possible, and the other player's proposal would be the rest. For example, if I propose 1 bell and 1 thread (value 4), then the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll, 1 thread (value 6). Total 10. That's good. But if the other player proposes something else, like 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4), then my proposal is 1 bell and 1 thread (4), and their proposal is 2 bells and 1 doll (4). But that would require 3 bells (1+2) which is more than available (2), so it's not complementary. So that would result in zero. So that's bad. Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that is a subset of the items, and the other player's proposal is the complement. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that is as valuable as possible, and the other player's proposal would be the rest.

Wait, but if I take all items, then the other player can't take any, so their proposal would be empty, which is not complementary. So that's bad. So I need to leave some items for the other player.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the best approach is to propose a set of items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. For example, if I propose 1 bell and 1 thread (value 4), then the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll, 1 thread (value 6). Total 10. Alternatively, if I propose 2 threads (value 6), the other player can take 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4). Total 10. Either way, the total is 10. So maybe any of these proposals would work. But which one is better? Since I don't know the other player's values, but the total is fixed, maybe it doesn't matter. However, if the other player's values are different, maybe one proposal is better. For example, if the other player values bells more, then taking 2 bells would be better for them. But since I don't know, I can't optimize for that. So the safest way is to make a proposal that is as valuable as possible, and the other player's proposal would be the rest. So I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. \n\nSo, for example, if I propose 2 threads (value 6), then the other player can take 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4). Total 10. Alternatively, if I propose 1 doll and 2 threads (value 8), then the other player can take 2 bells (value 2). Total 10. So same. So maybe any of these is acceptable. But which one to choose?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a set that is more balanced. For example, 1 bell, 1 doll, 1 thread (value 1+2+3=6). Then the other player can take 1 bell and 1 thread (value 1+3=4). Total 10. That's also good. But again, same total. So it seems that any division that uses all items gives the maximum total. Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that is a subset of the items, and the other player's proposal is the complement. \n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. Let me think about which proposal would be most likely to be complementary. If I propose 2 threads, then the other player can take 2 bells and 1 doll. That's complementary. If I propose 1 bell and 1 thread, the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll, 1 thread. Also complementary. If I propose 1 doll and 2 threads, the other player can take 2 bells. Also complementary. So all these are possible. \n\nBut since I want to maximize my own score, I should choose the proposal that gives me the highest value. For example, 2 threads (value 6) is better than 1 bell and 1 thread (4) or 1 doll and 2 threads (8). Wait, 1 doll and 2 threads is 2+6=8, which is higher than 6. So that's better. So if I propose 1 doll and 2 threads, that's 8. Then the other player can take 2 bells (value 2). Total 10. So that's better for me. But if the other player's proposal is 2 bells, then that's good. But if they propose something else, like 1 bell and 1 doll, then it's not complementary. But since I can't know, maybe I should go with the proposal that gives me the highest value, assuming that the other player will take the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 1 doll and 2 threads. That's 8. Then the other player can take 2 bells. So that's good. But if the other player proposes something else, like 1 bell and 1 doll, then it's not complementary. But since I can't know, maybe that's the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 2 bells and 1 doll. That's 2*1 +2=4. Then the other player can take 2 threads (6). Total 10. But that's worse for me. So I should avoid that. \n\nSo the best proposal for me is to take 1 doll and 2 threads (value 8), and the other player takes 2 bells (value 2). Total 10. That's the maximum possible. So I should make that proposal. \n\nBut how to format it? The secret proposal should be in the format [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So for example, [Proposal: 1 doll, 2 threads]. \n\nBut wait, the items are 2 bells, 1 doll, 2 threads. So if I take 1 doll and 2 threads, that's possible. The other player can take 2 bells. So that's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 threads and 1 bell, that's 1+6=7. Then the other player can take 1 bell, 1 doll. Value 1+2=3. Total 10. But that's less than 8+2=10. So the previous proposal is better. \n\nSo the best is to propose 1 doll and 2 threads. That gives me 8, and the other player 2. Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose 2 threads and 1 bell, that's 1+6=7. Other player takes 1 bell and 1 doll (3). Total 10. \n\nBut 8+2 is better for me. So I should propose 1 doll and 2 threads. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is the complement. But since I can't know, but the goal is to maximize the sum, which is fixed at 10 if all items are used. So any proposal that allows the other player to take the remaining items would work. \n\nTherefore, the best is to make a secret proposal of 1 doll and 2 threads. \n\nBut wait, the other player might not propose the remaining items. For example, if they propose something else, like 2 bells and 1 doll, then my proposal is 1 doll and 2 threads (3 items), and their proposal is 2 bells and 1 doll (3 items). But that would require 2 bells (available) and 2 dolls (but there's only 1 doll). So that's not possible. So their proposal would be invalid. Therefore, the other player's proposal must be a subset of the remaining items. \n\nSo if I propose 1 doll and 2 threads, the remaining items are 2 bells. So the other player can propose 2 bells. That's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose 2 threads, the remaining items are 2 bells and 1 doll. The other player can propose 2 bells and 1 doll. That's complementary. \n\nSo both proposals are valid. \n\nBut which one is better for me? If I take 2 threads (value 6), and the other player takes 2 bells and 1 doll (value 4), total 10. If I take 1 doll and 2 threads (8), and the other player takes 2 bells (2), total 10. So both are same. \n\nBut since I want to maximize my own score, I should choose the proposal that gives me the highest value. So 1 doll and 2 threads (8) is better than 2 threads (6). So I should propose that. \n\nTherefore, my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 doll, 2 threads]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the format is correct. The format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, ...]. So for 1 doll and 2 threads, it would be [Proposal: 1 doll, 2 threads]. \n\nYes. That should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose 2 threads and 1 doll, same thing. \n\nBut the order doesn't matter. \n\nSo the final answer is to make a secret proposal of 1 doll and 2 threads.\n"

You can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal at any time.\n(c) You are each asked to submit a secret proposal indicating the items you want formatted in square brackets as follows: \"[Proposal: <number> <object name>, <number> <object name>, <...>]\"\n(d) If your proposals are complementary, i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both proposals, each player is awarded a score based on the sum of values for the items they received.

                    "content": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 2 bells, 1 doll, and 2 threads. My value function is bell:0, doll:2, thread:4. So I value threads the most, then dolls, then bells which I don't care about.\n\nThe other player's proposal is secret, so I don't know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don't overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my proposal needs to complement theirs.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, how can I decide? Hmm. Wait, maybe the other player's proposal is known to me? Or is it that they made a secret proposal, which I can't see? The rules say that secret proposals are submitted, so I can't see their proposal. So I have to make my own proposal without knowing theirs. But how can I ensure that our proposals are complementary?\n\nWait, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer based on their possible strategy. But since I don't have any information about their value function, I can't be sure. However, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So I need to propose items that, when combined with theirs, cover as much as possible of the available items, especially the ones with high value.\n\nSince I value threads the most (4 each), I should try to get as many threads as possible. There are 2 threads. If I can get both, that's 8 points. Then the doll is worth 2, and bells are 0. So maybe I should propose taking both threads and the doll. But if the other player also wants those, then our proposals would conflict, leading to zero. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that the other player might not want, but I can't know their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are less valuable to me but more valuable to them. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky. Wait, but the other player's secret proposal is already made. So maybe I need to make a proposal that complements theirs. But since I don't know theirs, perhaps I should make a proposal that covers the items I value most, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since it's a secret proposal, I can't see it. So perhaps the best strategy is to propose items that are high value to me, and if possible, leave some items for the other player. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their scores. So if I propose items that don't overlap with the other player's proposal, then we can both get our items. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a guess. Maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't conflict with. For example, if they proposed items that I don't value, then I can take the high-value items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that it doesn't conflict. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me, and if possible, leave some items for the other player. But without knowing their proposal, it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can infer. For example, if they made a secret proposal, maybe they are trying to get items that they value. But since I don't know their values, I can't be sure. However, given that the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that are high value to me, and if possible, leave some items for the other player. For example, if I take both threads (which I value 4 each) and the doll (2), that's 10 points. If the other player's proposal doesn't include these, then we can both get our items. But if their proposal includes some of these, then we get zero. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose the items I value most.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't conflict with. For example, if they proposed items that I don't value, like bells. Since I value bells 0, maybe they proposed bells. Then I can take the threads and doll. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to make a proposal that includes all the high-value items for me, and if the other player's proposal is compatible, then we both get our items. Otherwise, we get zero. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose the items I value most. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 threads, 1 doll]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include these, we can both get them. If their proposal does include some, then we get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the threads, leaving the doll and bells for the other player. But if the other player's proposal includes the doll, then we can't both get it. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can't know, so the best I can do is to propose my highest value items. So I'll go with 2 threads and 1 doll. That's my proposal.\n"
