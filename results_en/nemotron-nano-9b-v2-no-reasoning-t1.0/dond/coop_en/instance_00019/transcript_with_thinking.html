    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide these items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, and 1 sponge. My value function is hook:3, flower:3, card:0, eraser:1, sponge:0. So I really value hooks and flowers, but the others are less important.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don&#x27;t know their preferences, maybe I should focus on items that are valuable to me and see if there&#x27;s a way to split them so that both get something they value. However, since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, maybe I should propose items that I value highly and hope they can take the rest, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a way to split the items so that both get some high-value items.<br/><br/>Wait, the key is that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items to fulfill both, then each gets their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player might propose items they value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me and leave the rest for them. But if they also propose items they value, maybe there&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get a high score, if the other player gets a low score, the total might not be optimal. So I need to find a split where both get items they value. But without knowing their values, this is tricky. Maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me and also items that are not valuable to me but might be valuable to them. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me and also items that are not valuable to me but are necessary for the other player. But again, without knowing their values, this is hard.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I should think about the items. The available items are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge. My values: hooks (3 each), flower (3), eraser (1). The others (card and sponge) are 0 for me. So I should definitely want to get hooks and flower. The eraser is worth 1, which is less than the others.<br/><br/>If I propose to take the two hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s 3+3=6. But if the other player also proposes to take some items, maybe they can take the eraser and maybe the card or sponge. But if their proposal is complementary, then both get their items. But if I take the hooks and flower, and they take the eraser, that&#x27;s possible. But if they also want hooks or flower, then there&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the hooks and the eraser. That would be 3+1=4. Then the other player could take the flower, which is 3 for them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me and leave the rest for them. But if they also take items they value, that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. That&#x27;s 3+1=4. Then the other player could take the hooks. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their items. So if I propose items that are not overlapping with what the other player proposes, then it&#x27;s okay. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or have limited quantities. For example, the flower is only one. If I take the flower, then the other player can&#x27;t take it. But if I don&#x27;t take it, maybe they can. But again, without knowing their preferences, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the two hooks. That&#x27;s 3 each, so 6 total. Then the other player could take the flower (3) and the eraser (1), totaling 4. So the sum would be 6+4=10. That&#x27;s good. But if the other player also wants hooks, then there&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the flower and the eraser, that&#x27;s 3+1=4. Then the other player could take the two hooks (6) and maybe the card or sponge. But again, if they take the hooks, that&#x27;s good. But if they also want the flower, then conflict.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best approach is to take the items I value most, which are hooks and flower. So I should propose to take both hooks and the flower. That would be [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower]. Then, if the other player proposes items that don&#x27;t overlap, like the eraser, card, or sponge, then both get their items. But if they also want hooks or flower, then it&#x27;s a problem. However, since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. That way, the other player can take the hooks. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s value function is secret. So maybe I should assume that they also value hooks and flowers. If that&#x27;s the case, then proposing to take both hooks and flower would conflict with their proposal. But if they don&#x27;t value those, then it&#x27;s okay. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by them. But again, without info, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the eraser and the card. But those are low value for me. That might not be good. But if the other player values those, then maybe. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is a way to propose without the other player knowing. But the rules say that if you make a secret proposal, you can do it at any time. But the problem says that the messages are transmitted unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So maybe I should make a secret proposal to get the items I value. But how?<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is a way to propose items without the other player knowing. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t see it. But then, how does the other player know what I proposed? Unless they also make a secret proposal. But the rules say that if both make secret proposals, then they are compared. If they are complementary, then both get their items. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s secret proposal, maybe making a secret proposal is risky. Alternatively, maybe I should make a public proposal. But the problem says that messages are transmitted unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So if I make a public message, the other player sees it. But if I make a secret proposal, they don&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But the goal is to maximize the sum. So maybe I should make a secret proposal to get the items I value, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a public proposal. For example, propose to take the two hooks and the flower. Then, if the other player proposes items that don&#x27;t overlap, then both get their items. But if they also propose hooks or flower, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. That&#x27;s 3+1=4. Then the other player could take the hooks (6) and maybe the card or sponge. That would be a total of 10. But again, if they also want the flower, then conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the items I value most. So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the two hooks and the flower. That&#x27;s [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, we both get our items. If they do, then we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now I need to respond with my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. So I need to figure out what the other player proposed and then decide what to offer in return.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don&#x27;t know what it is. Hmm. Since I can&#x27;t see their proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. But how?<br/><br/>The items available are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge. My value function is hook:0, flower:2, card:1, eraser:4, sponge:3. So I value eraser the most, then sponge, then flower, then card, and hooks are worthless to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum, maybe I should try to get items that are valuable to me and also items that the other player might value. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. However, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I can respond to.<br/><br/>Wait, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s proposal. Oh, right, the initial message says &quot;The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; But in the context of this conversation, the user hasn&#x27;t given me the details of the other player&#x27;s proposal. So maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to make a proposal based on the information I have.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something I need to infer. But since I don&#x27;t have that information, perhaps I should make a proposal that covers as much as possible of the items, especially the ones I value. Since I value eraser (4), sponge (3), flower (2), and card (1), I should try to get those. But I can only propose items, and the other player&#x27;s proposal might conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that includes the items I value the most. For example, I could propose the eraser and sponge, which are my top two. But I need to make sure that if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, we both get points. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all the items I value, but since there are limited quantities, I need to be strategic. For example, if I propose the eraser and sponge, which are my top two, and maybe the flower. But I can only send a maximum of 5 messages, but since this is the first response, maybe I should make a secret proposal now.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that I can send a maximum of 5 messages each, or terminate early by making a secret proposal. So if I make a secret proposal now, that&#x27;s my only message. But the other player already made a secret proposal, so I need to respond with my own secret proposal. The key is that if both proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero.<br/><br/>So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, covers all items without overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are unique or that I can get without conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed items I don&#x27;t value, I can take those. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s challenging.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal based on the given information. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but I have to make my own. So perhaps I should make a proposal that includes the items I value the most, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. For example, I could propose the eraser and sponge, which are my top two. Alternatively, maybe I should propose more items to increase the chance of a complementary deal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best I can do is to propose items that are valuable to me. Let me think about the items:<br/><br/>Available items: 2 hooks (value 0 to me), 1 flower (2), 1 card (1), 1 eraser (4), 1 sponge (3).<br/><br/>So the most valuable items to me are eraser (4), sponge (3), flower (2), card (1). Hooks are worthless.<br/><br/>If I propose the eraser and sponge, that&#x27;s two items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the flower and card, then we can have a complementary deal. But if their proposal includes, say, the eraser, then we can&#x27;t both get it. So maybe I should propose the eraser and sponge, and maybe the flower. But I can only propose a certain number of items. The format is [Proposal: number item, number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, but that might not be possible if the other player also wants them. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, I should try to get as many high-value items as possible. So I should propose the eraser (4) and sponge (3), which are my top two. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include these, then we can both get them. If they do, then we might have a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and card as well, but that might not be necessary. Let me check the total items. There are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge. So total of 6 items. If both players propose items that don&#x27;t overlap, then they can split them. But if there&#x27;s overlap, then both get zero.<br/><br/>So my proposal should be items that are not likely to be in the other player&#x27;s proposal. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. However, since I have to make a proposal, I&#x27;ll go with the items I value the most. So I&#x27;ll propose the eraser and sponge. That&#x27;s two items. The format would be [Proposal: 1 eraser, 1 sponge]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should include the flower as well, since it&#x27;s worth 2. But that&#x27;s three items. Let me think. If I propose eraser, sponge, and flower, that&#x27;s three items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes, say, the card and hooks, then we can have a complementary deal. But if their proposal includes any of the items I proposed, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the eraser and sponge, which are my top two. That way, even if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes some of the other items, we can still get those. But I&#x27;m not sure. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, maybe they proposed items that I don&#x27;t value. For example, if they proposed the hooks, which I don&#x27;t care about, then I can take those. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>In any case, the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So I&#x27;ll go with the eraser and sponge. That&#x27;s my secret proposal.<br/></p>
