    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 2 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. My value function is chalk:4, shoe:1, fruit:0. So I really value chalks, shoes are okay, and fruits don&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should assume they have different preferences. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to fulfill both), then each gets their own items. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we each request don&#x27;t overlap in a way that exceeds the available quantities.<br/><br/>My goal is to propose items that I value highly, but also leave enough for the other player to get some items they value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I want, but also consider that the other player might need certain items. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. However, since the total score is the sum, maybe I should aim for a division where both get as much as possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, each is awarded based on their own items. So if I propose some items and the other proposes others, and together they don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities, then both get their items. Otherwise, zero. So the challenge is to make sure that the combined proposals don&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>So, for example, if I propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe, and the other proposes 1 chalk and 1 shoe, then total chalks would be 3, which is more than 2 available. So that&#x27;s not complementary. So both get zero. But if I propose 1 chalk and 1 shoe, and the other proposes 1 chalk and 1 shoe, then total is 2 chalks and 2 shoes, which is okay. Then both get their items. My score would be 4 (chalk) +1 (shoe) =5, and the other&#x27;s score depends on their values. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also leave some for the other player.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value the most, and hope the other player can get the rest. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, perhaps the best approach is to propose items that I want, and maybe the other player can take the rest. But how to structure the messages?<br/><br/>The rules say that I can send up to 5 messages, or make a secret proposal at any time. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But the problem says that the messages are transmitted to the other player unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So if I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s not sent to the other player. But the other player might not know my proposal. However, the other player can also make a secret proposal. But the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So maybe the best way is to make a secret proposal that I think is optimal, and then the other player can respond with their own.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and maybe the other player can take the rest. For example, if I propose 2 chalks and 1 shoe, then the other player could propose 1 shoe and 2 fruits. But since fruits are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. However, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to optimize.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 chalks and 0 shoes, and 0 fruits. Then the other player can take the remaining 2 shoes and 2 fruits. But if the other player values shoes, that&#x27;s good. But if they don&#x27;t, then maybe they would propose something else. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 0 fruits. Then the other player could take 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Wait, but the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get as much as possible, and the other player can get as much as possible, that&#x27;s best. So maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. For example, if I take 2 chalks (which I value 4 each, so 8 total), and the other player takes 2 shoes (if they value shoes, say, 1 each, that&#x27;s 2). Total would be 10. But if the other player values shoes more, maybe they can get more. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose 2 chalks and 0 shoes, and 0 fruits. Then the other player can take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they would propose something else. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 0 fruits. Then the other player can take 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s 1 each, so 2. My score would be 4+1=5, their score 2, total 7. But if I take 2 chalks, that&#x27;s 8, and they take 2 shoes (2), total 10. That&#x27;s better. So maybe proposing 2 chalks is better.<br/><br/>But what if the other player also wants chalks? Then if I propose 2 chalks, and they propose 2 chalks, that&#x27;s 4 chalks, which is more than available. So both get zero. That&#x27;s bad. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don&#x27;t overlap in a way that exceeds the available items.<br/><br/>So maybe I should propose 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 0 fruits. Then the other player can propose 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That would be 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. Which is exactly the available items. So that&#x27;s complementary. Then my score is 4+1=5, their score depends on their values. If they value shoes, say, 1 each, then 2. Total 7. But if they value something else, maybe more. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a balanced approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 2 chalks and 0 shoes, and they propose 0 chalks, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. That would be 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So that&#x27;s complementary. My score is 8, their score is 2 (if they value shoes 1 each). Total 10. That&#x27;s better. So maybe that&#x27;s a better approach.<br/><br/>But how do I know if the other player will propose 2 shoes? Maybe they might propose something else. But since I can&#x27;t know, perhaps the best is to propose 2 chalks and 0 shoes, and 0 fruits. Then the other player can take the rest. If they take 2 shoes and 2 fruits, that&#x27;s good. If they take something else, maybe they can&#x27;t get as much. But since I can&#x27;t control their proposal, I have to make my own.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is not sent to the other player. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t know my proposal. But then they might make their own. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player makes their own, and they are complementary, then both get their items. But if I make a secret proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is not complementary, then both get zero. So maybe making a secret proposal is risky, but if I can get a good deal, it&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, maybe it&#x27;s better to make a public proposal. Wait, but the messages are transmitted unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So if I make a public message, the other player can see it. So maybe I should start by making a public message to suggest a division. For example, &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks and 1 shoe. You can take the rest.&quot; But the problem says that the messages are directly transmitted, so I need to format them properly. But the secret proposal is in the specific format. So maybe I should first send a message to the other player suggesting a division, and then make a secret proposal if needed.<br/><br/>But the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s messages yet. Since this is a simulation, I need to act as the player. So I need to decide what to do. Let me think again.<br/><br/>My value function: chalk is 4, shoe 1, fruit 0. So I want as many chalks as possible. The other player&#x27;s value function is unknown. To maximize the total, I need to get as many chalks as possible, and the other player should get items they value. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that I want, and hope the other player can take the rest. For example, if I take 2 chalks, then the other player can take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they take fruits, which I don&#x27;t care about. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 1 chalk and 1 shoe, then the other player can take 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That&#x27;s 2 chalks, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So that&#x27;s complementary. My score is 4+1=5, their score depends on their values. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s 2. Total 7. But if I take 2 chalks, and they take 2 shoes, that&#x27;s 8+2=10. So that&#x27;s better. So maybe proposing 2 chalks is better.<br/><br/>But how to propose that? The secret proposal format is [Proposal: 2 chalks]. But if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t know. So maybe I should make a public message first. For example, &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the rest.&quot; But the problem says that messages are transmitted unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So if I send a message like &quot;I propose 2 chalks&quot;, the other player will see it. Then they can respond. But if I make a secret proposal, they don&#x27;t see it. So maybe the best is to make a public proposal first.<br/><br/>But the user hasn&#x27;t provided the other player&#x27;s response. So in this scenario, I need to decide what to do. Since I can make up to 5 messages, maybe I should start by making a public proposal. Let me try that.<br/><br/>So my first message could be: &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the remaining 2 shoes and 2 fruits.&quot; But the format for a secret proposal is specific. However, the user said that unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal, messages are transmitted. So if I send a message like &quot;I propose 2 chalks&quot;, that&#x27;s a public message. The other player would see it. Then they might respond. But since I don&#x27;t have their response, maybe I need to make a secret proposal. But the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now.<br/><br/>Wait, the user is asking me to act as the player. So I need to generate the messages. The initial message from me would be either a public message or a secret proposal. Since the user hasn&#x27;t provided any previous messages, I need to start.<br/><br/>If I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s not sent to the other player. So they don&#x27;t know my proposal. Then they might make their own. But if I make a public message, they can see it. So maybe the best is to make a public message first, suggesting a division. For example, &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the rest.&quot; But the exact format for a secret proposal is [Proposal: ...], but for public messages, it&#x27;s just text. So I need to make sure that if I want to make a secret proposal, I use the exact format. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a public message.<br/><br/>So maybe I should start with a public message. Let me think. If I propose 2 chalks, then the other player can take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they take fruits, which I don&#x27;t care about. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet. Alternatively, if I propose 1 chalk and 1 shoe, then the other player can take 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That&#x27;s also complementary. But my score would be 5, and theirs depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I want to maximize the total, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. So 2 chalks is better for me. So I should propose 2 chalks. But how to do that? As a public message or a secret proposal?<br/><br/>If I make a public message, the other player can see it and respond. If I make a secret proposal, they don&#x27;t know. But if I make a secret proposal, and they make their own, maybe they can propose something that conflicts. But if I make a secret proposal, and they also make a secret proposal, then we have to check if they are complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a public proposal. Let me try that. So my first message is: &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the remaining 2 shoes and 2 fruits.&quot; Then the other player might respond. But since I don&#x27;t have their response, maybe I need to proceed. However, the problem says that I can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now. For example, [Proposal: 2 chalks]. Then the other player would have to make their own proposal. If their proposal is complementary, then both get their items. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t know my proposal. So they might propose something that conflicts. For example, if they propose 2 chalks as well, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So both get zero. That&#x27;s bad. So maybe making a public proposal is safer, because the other player can see my proposal and adjust theirs accordingly.<br/><br/>But the problem says that the messages are transmitted unless it&#x27;s a secret proposal. So if I make a public message, the other player can see it. So maybe I should make a public message first. Let me try that.<br/><br/>So my first message would be: &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the remaining 2 shoes and 2 fruits.&quot; Then the other player might respond. But since I don&#x27;t have their response, maybe I need to proceed. However, the user is expecting me to generate the messages. So perhaps I should make a secret proposal now. But I need to decide.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of 2 chalks, then the other player can make their own proposal. If they propose 2 shoes and 2 fruits, then it&#x27;s complementary. My score is 8, theirs is whatever they value. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they take fruits, which I don&#x27;t care about. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, if I make a public proposal, the other player can see it and maybe adjust. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to say.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 0 fruits. Then the other player can take 1 chalk, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That&#x27;s complementary. My score is 5, theirs depends on their values. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s 2. Total 7. But if I take 2 chalks, and they take 2 shoes, total is 10. So that&#x27;s better. So maybe proposing 2 chalks is better.<br/><br/>But how to propose that. If I make a secret proposal, the other player doesn&#x27;t know. So they might propose 2 chalks as well, leading to conflict. So maybe a public proposal is better. So I should send a message like &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the rest.&quot; Then the other player can respond. If they agree, then we have a complementary proposal. If not, maybe they propose something else.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t actually send messages in this context, I need to simulate the process. The user is asking me to act as the player. So I need to decide what to do. Given that, I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal of 2 chalks. Because if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict, then I get 8, and they get whatever they value. If they do conflict, then both get zero. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s a risk. Alternatively, making a public proposal might be better.<br/><br/>But the problem says that the secret proposal is formatted in square brackets. So if I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s not sent to the other player. So they can&#x27;t see it. So if I make a secret proposal of 2 chalks, and the other player makes a secret proposal of 2 shoes, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they make a secret proposal of 2 chalks, then it&#x27;s not. So it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a public proposal. Let me try that. So my first message is: &quot;I propose to take 2 chalks. You can take the remaining 2 shoes and 2 fruits.&quot; Then the other player might respond. If they agree, then we have a complementary proposal. If not, they might propose something else.

So that&#x27;s better. So I think proposing 2 chalks is better.<br/><br/>But how to do that. If I make a secret proposal, it&#x27;s not sent. So the other player might not know. So maybe I should make a public proposal. So I&#x27;ll go with that. My first message is a public proposal of 2 chalks. Then the other player can respond. If they accept, then we have a good deal. If not, maybe they propose something else. But since I can&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll proceed with that.<br/></p>

But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my proposal needs to complement theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, how can I decide? Hmm. Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is already known to me? Or is it that they made a secret proposal, and I have to respond with my own secret proposal? The rules say that each player submits a secret proposal. So maybe both proposals are secret, and then they are checked for complementarity. But in this case, the other player has already submitted their secret proposal, and now I need to submit mine. But how can I know if they are complementary without knowing their proposal?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not known to me. So I have to make a proposal that, regardless of theirs, maximizes the chance that they are complementary. But that&#x27;s tricky. Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is known to me? The problem says &quot;the other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.&quot; So perhaps the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, but I need to make my own secret proposal. But how can I ensure that they are complementary? Unless I can infer their proposal based on some strategy.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is not known, so I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s hard. Wait, but the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers as many items as possible, especially the ones I value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, so that even if they propose some items, there&#x27;s a chance that the total doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items. For example, if I propose 2 fruits and 2 chalks, that&#x27;s 4 items. But there are 2 fruits and 2 chalks. So if they propose something else, maybe there&#x27;s overlap. But if I propose 2 fruits and 2 chalks, and they propose 2 shoes, then total items would be 2 fruits, 2 chalks, 2 shoes, which is exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. But if they propose something else, like 2 fruits and 2 shoes, then there&#x27;s overlap in fruits, so it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to conflict. Since I value fruits the most, maybe I should take all the fruits. But if they also take fruits, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But if I take all fruits, then they can&#x27;t take any, so maybe that&#x27;s better. But if they take some fruits, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose 2 fruits and 2 chalks. That way, if they propose 2 shoes, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose something else, maybe not. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is such that they might want items I don&#x27;t value. For example, if they value shoes, but I don&#x27;t. So if I take fruits and chalks, and they take shoes, that&#x27;s good. But if they take fruits, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose 2 fruits and 2 chalks. That way, if they propose 2 shoes, it&#x27;s complementary. If they propose something else, maybe not. But since I can&#x27;t know, this might be the best bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 fruits and 1 chalk. But that leaves 1 chalk and 2 shoes. If they take the remaining chalk and shoes, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. So maybe proposing the items I value most, which are fruits and chalks. So I&#x27;ll go with 2 fruits and 2 chalks. That&#x27;s my secret proposal.<br/></p>
