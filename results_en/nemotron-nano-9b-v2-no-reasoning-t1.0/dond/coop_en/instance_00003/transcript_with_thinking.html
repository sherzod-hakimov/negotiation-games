    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 bags, and 1 onion. My value function is carrot:3, bag:1, onion:3. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but since we want to maximize the sum, I should consider possible scenarios.<br/><br/>First, the key is that both proposals need to be complementary. That means the items they request must not overlap. So if I take the carrot and onion, the other player can take the bags. Or maybe split the bags between us. But since there are 4 bags, maybe splitting them could be better if the other player values them more.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make assumptions. However, the goal is to maximize the sum. So maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and leave items that the other player might value more. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s values are also given? No, the problem states that each has a secret value function. So I don&#x27;t know theirs. Hmm.<br/><br/>But the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to propose items that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, cover all items, and the sum of both players&#x27; values is maximized. But since I don&#x27;t know the other&#x27;s values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to the other player? But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is also given? No, the problem says each has a secret value function. So I don&#x27;t have access to theirs. So I need to make a proposal that, given the possible other player&#x27;s values, maximizes the expected sum. But since I don&#x27;t have that info, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and leave items that are less valuable to me, assuming the other player might value them more. But this is speculative.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all the items I value highly, and the other player can take the rest. For example, I value carrot and onion highly (3 each), and bags are 1 each. So if I take the carrot and onion, that&#x27;s 3+3=6. Then the other player can take the 4 bags, which if they value them at 1 each, that&#x27;s 4. Total sum 10. But if the other player values bags more, say 2 each, then their total would be 8, making the sum 14. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the carrot and some bags, but that might leave the onion for the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. Maybe the best is to propose the carrot and onion, and let the other player take the bags. That way, if they value the bags, they get them. If not, maybe they can&#x27;t take them, but since the proposals need to be complementary, if I take carrot and onion, the other player can take the bags. So that&#x27;s a possible proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the carrot and some bags, but that might not be optimal. Let me think. If I take the carrot (3) and 2 bags (2), total 5. Then the other player can take the onion (3) and 2 bags (2), total 5. Sum 10. But if the other player values the onion more, that&#x27;s good. But if they value bags more, maybe they can take more. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the first approach is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the carrot and onion, and the other player can take the bags. That way, if they value the bags, they get them. If not, maybe they can&#x27;t, but since the proposals need to be complementary, if I take carrot and onion, the other player can take the bags. So that&#x27;s a possible proposal.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 carrot, 1 onion]. Then the other player can take the 4 bags. If they value the bags, they get 4*1=4, and I get 3+3=6. Total 10. If they value bags more, say 2 each, then 8, total 14. But if they don&#x27;t value bags, maybe they can&#x27;t take them, but since the proposals need to be complementary, if I take carrot and onion, the other player can take the bags. So that&#x27;s a possible way.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the carrot and some bags, but that might not be as good. For example, if I take carrot and 3 bags (3+3=6), then the other player can take onion and 1 bag (3+1=4). Total 10. Same as before. But if the other player values the onion more, that&#x27;s good. But if they value bags more, maybe they can take more. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Another angle: since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to have both players get as much as possible. So if I take the carrot and onion (total 6), and the other player takes the 4 bags (4), sum 10. Alternatively, if I take the carrot and 4 bags (3+4=7), and the other player takes the onion (3), sum 10. Same total. But if the other player values the bags more, then taking the bags would be better. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the carrot and onion, and let the other player take the bags. That way, if they value the bags, they get them. If not, maybe they can&#x27;t, but the proposals need to be complementary. So if I take carrot and onion, the other player can take the bags. So that&#x27;s a valid proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the carrot and some bags, but that might not be as good. For example, if I take carrot and 2 bags (3+2=5), and the other player takes onion and 2 bags (3+2=5), sum 10. Same as before. But if the other player values the bags more, they might prefer to take more. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>So the safest bet is to propose the carrot and onion, and let the other player take the bags. That way, if they value the bags, they get them. If not, maybe they can&#x27;t, but the proposals are complementary. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 carrot, 1 onion]. That&#x27;s my plan.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 bags, and 1 onion. My value function is carrot:0, bag:1, onion:6. So I value onions a lot, bags a little, and carrots nothing.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, so I don&#x27;t know what they proposed. But since they submitted a secret proposal, maybe I need to figure out what they might have proposed. Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they propose don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items without overlap, and maximizes the total value.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that covers items I value highly, and leave the rest for them. But since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, each gets their score. So if I can make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items, then we both get our scores. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t have overlapping items and uses all items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that their proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose all the items I value, and leave the rest for them. For example, I value onions the most. So I should propose the onion. Then, if their proposal includes the carrot and bags, that would be good. But if their proposal also includes the onion, then we can&#x27;t both get it, so we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn&#x27;t overlap with theirs.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should propose the onion and some bags. Let me think. My value for onion is 6, which is high. So I should definitely take the onion. Then, for the bags, I value each at 1. There are 4 bags. If I take some bags, maybe 2 or 3, but I need to leave enough for them. But if I take too many, maybe they can&#x27;t take any. Alternatively, maybe I should take the onion and leave the rest for them. But if they take the onion, then we both get zero. So maybe I should take the onion and some bags, but not all. Let me think.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and all the bags. But if they also propose the onion, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So that&#x27;s a risk. But if I take the onion, and they don&#x27;t, then I get 6, and they get whatever they have. But if they also take the onion, then we both get zero. So maybe I should take the onion and some bags, but not all. Let me calculate.<br/><br/>If I take the onion (6 points) and, say, 2 bags (2 points), total 8. Then, if their proposal includes the remaining 2 bags and the carrot, then they get 2*1 + 0 = 2. Total sum is 10. But if their proposal includes the onion, then we both get zero. So the risk is that if they also take the onion, we lose everything. But if I don&#x27;t take the onion, maybe they take it, and I get nothing. So it&#x27;s a trade-off.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and all the bags. If they don&#x27;t take the onion, then I get 6 + 4*1 = 10, and they get the carrot (0). Total 10. If they do take the onion, then we both get zero. But if I don&#x27;t take the onion, and they take it, then I get nothing, and they get 6. But if I take the onion, and they don&#x27;t, then I get 6 plus bags, and they get the carrot. So maybe taking the onion is better.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible. Let me think about possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose the onion and all 4 bags, then:<br/><br/>- If their proposal doesn&#x27;t include the onion or any bags, then we can both get our items. I get 6 + 4*1 = 10, they get the carrot (0). Total 10.<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes the onion, then we both get zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes some bags, then we can&#x27;t both have them. So if they take, say, 2 bags, then I can&#x27;t take those, but I can take the onion and the other 2 bags. But if their proposal includes the onion, then we both get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the onion and 2 bags, then:<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes the onion, zero.<br/><br/>- If their proposal includes the carrot and 2 bags, then I can take the onion and 2 bags, they take the carrot and 2 bags. Total 6+2*1 + 0 + 2*1 = 10.<br/><br/>But if their proposal includes the onion, then zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. Then, if they take the carrot and 1 bag, that&#x27;s possible. But again, if they take the onion, zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the onion and as many bags as possible, but not all. Or maybe just the onion. Because if I take the onion, and they don&#x27;t, then I get 6 plus whatever bags I can get. But if they take the onion, then we both get zero. But if I don&#x27;t take the onion, and they do, then I get nothing. So maybe taking the onion is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and the carrot. But I value the carrot as 0, so that&#x27;s not helpful. But if I take the carrot, maybe they can take the onion and bags. But since I value the carrot as 0, it&#x27;s better to leave it for them. So maybe I should propose the onion and some bags.<br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe I should propose the onion and all the bags. If they don&#x27;t take the onion, then I get 10, they get 0. If they do take the onion, then zero. But if I don&#x27;t take the onion, and they do, then I get nothing. So the risk is higher if I don&#x27;t take the onion. So maybe taking the onion is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 3 bags. Then, if they take the carrot and 1 bag, that&#x27;s possible. But again, if they take the onion, zero.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the onion and all the bags. Because if they don&#x27;t take the onion, I get maximum value. If they do, then we both lose. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the onion and 2 bags. Then, if they take the carrot and 2 bags, that&#x27;s possible. But again, if they take the onion, zero.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the onion and all the bags. Let me check the items: 1 carrot, 4 bags, 1 onion. So if I take the onion and 4 bags, that&#x27;s all items except the carrot. Then, if their proposal is the carrot, then we can both get our items. I get 6 + 4*1 = 10, they get 0. Total 10. If their proposal includes the onion or any bags, then we can&#x27;t both have them. So if they propose the onion, then we both get zero. If they propose some bags, then we can&#x27;t both have them. So the risk is that if they also want the onion or bags, we lose. But if they don&#x27;t, then we get 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the onion and 3 bags, then if they take the carrot and 1 bag, that&#x27;s possible. But again, if they take the onion, zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best is to propose the onion and all the bags. Because that&#x27;s the maximum I can get if they don&#x27;t conflict. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>
