                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to divide the items between me and the other player to maximize the total score. The items available are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, and 1 fork. My value function is scissors:3, thimble:0, fork:1. So I value scissors the most, then fork, and thimble is worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since we need to maximize the sum of both scores, I should consider what they might value. But since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should assume they have different priorities. However, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), then each gets their items and their scores are summed. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we propose don't overlap in a way that requires more than what's available.\n\nMy goal is to propose items that I value highly, but also leave enough for the other player to get items they value. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value and hope they can get the rest. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, this is tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has a secret value function. So I can't know it. But since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player can take the rest. But if I take too much, maybe they can't get enough. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are not too valuable to me but could be valuable to them. But again, without knowing their values, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value, and the other player can take the remaining items. For example, if I take the scissors, which I value 3, and the other player can take the thimble and fork. But if the other player values thimble or fork, that's good. But if they don't, then maybe they can't get enough. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose the scissors and fork, which I value, and leave the thimble for them. But if they don't value the thimble, they might not get anything. But maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the scissors and the thimble. But since I value the thimble as 0, that's not good. Wait, but if I propose the thimble, maybe the other player values it. But again, I don't know. So maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are scissors and fork. Let me check the available items: 3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork. So if I propose, say, 2 scissors and the fork, that's 2+1=3 items. Then the other player can take the remaining 1 scissor and the thimble. But if the other player values the thimble, that's good. If not, they might not get anything. But since I can't know, maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the scissors. If I take all 3 scissors, then the other player can take the thimble and fork. But if they value those, that's good. But if they don't, they get zero. But since I don't know, maybe that's a risk. However, if I take all scissors, I get 3*3=9 points. The other player would get whatever they value from thimble and fork. If they value thimble as 0 and fork as 1, then their total is 1. So total sum is 10. If I take 2 scissors and the fork, I get 2*3 +1=7. The other player gets 1 scissor and thimble. If they value scissor as, say, 2, then their total is 2+0=2. Total sum 9. But if they value scissor as 5, then 5+0=5, total 12. But since I don't know, maybe it's better to take as much as possible of what I value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the scissors and the thimble. But since I value thimble as 0, that's not helpful. Unless the other player values it. But again, I don't know. So maybe the safest is to propose the scissors and fork. Let me think about the possible proposals.\n\nThe secret proposal format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I need to format that. But first, I need to decide what to propose. Let me think of possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose 3 scissors and 1 fork, that's all the items except the thimble. Then the other player can take the thimble. If they value it, that's good. If not, they get zero. But since I don't know, maybe that's the best. Alternatively, if I propose 2 scissors and 1 fork, leaving 1 scissor and 1 thimble. The other player can take those. If they value scissors, that's good. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose nothing, but that's not allowed. The rules say I can send a maximum of 5 messages or make a secret proposal. So I need to make a proposal. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, I should propose items that I value, and hope the other player can take the rest. So maybe propose 3 scissors and 1 fork. That way, I get 3*3 +1=10. The other player gets the thimble. If they value it, say, 5, then total is 15. If they value it 0, then total is 10. But if I propose 2 scissors and 1 fork, I get 7, and the other player gets 1 scissor and 1 thimble. If they value scissor as 3, then 3+0=3, total 10. If they value scissor as 5, then 5+0=5, total 12. So depending on their values, the total varies. But since I can't know, maybe the best is to take as much as possible of what I value, which is scissors and fork. So I'll propose 3 scissors and 1 fork. That's the maximum I can take. Then the other player can take the thimble. If they value it, that's good. If not, they get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 scissors, 1 fork].\n"

                    "content": "Okay, let's see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it's my turn. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, and 1 fork. My values are scissors:1, thimble:6, fork:1. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the other player's proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has submitted a secret proposal, but I don't have that information. Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, looking back at the user's message: \"The other player has submitted a secret proposal. It is now your turn to submit a proposal of your own.\" But the user didn't provide the content of the other player's proposal. That's a problem. How can I respond without knowing what they proposed?\n\nWait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate my own proposal based on the given setup. But the rules say that if proposals are complementary, we get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's, covers all items without overlap. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that covers all items, but that's not possible because there are 3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork. If I take all, then the other player can't take anything. But maybe the other player's proposal is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is not given, and I have to make a proposal that is optimal regardless. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps this is a test where I need to simulate the process. Since the user hasn't provided the other's proposal, maybe I should assume that the other player's proposal is something, and I need to respond optimally. But without knowing their proposal, how can I decide?\n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to generate a proposal that is optimal given the information. Since the other player's proposal is secret, but I have to make my own. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we get the sum. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's, covers all items. But since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should propose all items, but that would mean the other player can't get anything. Alternatively, maybe split the items in a way that maximizes the total value.\n\nBut since the other player's proposal is secret, perhaps I should make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. For example, if I take the thimble (which is worth 6 to me) and maybe some scissors. But if the other player also wants the thimble, then we can't both have it. So maybe I should take the thimble and some scissors, and leave the fork for the other player. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to propose all items, but that would mean the other player can't get anything. But if their proposal is also all items, then we can't both have them. So maybe a better approach is to propose a subset that maximizes my value, but also leaves some items for the other player. For example, take the thimble (6 points) and maybe one scissor (1 point), leaving two scissors and the fork. If the other player's proposal includes the remaining items, then we can both get points. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, I should propose items that, when combined with the other's, cover all items. So I need to make a proposal that, when added to the other's, covers all items. But without knowing their proposal, I can't be sure. However, maybe the optimal strategy is to propose the thimble and the fork, since those are the highest value items for me. Wait, the thimble is 6, fork is 1. Scissors are 1 each. So taking the thimble and fork would give me 7 points. If the other player's proposal includes the remaining scissors, then we can both get points. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and one scissor. That way, if the other player's proposal includes the other two scissors and the fork, then we can both get points. But again, without knowing their proposal, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning that there are enough items to fulfill both. So for example, if I propose [thimble, scissors], and the other proposes [scissors, scissors, fork], then together they have 3 scissors, 1 thimble, 1 fork. So that would be complementary. Then each gets their items. My score would be 6 (thimble) +1 (scissors) =7, and the other's would be 1+1+1=3. Total 10. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe the best way is to propose the thimble and the fork, since those are the highest value items. Then, if the other player's proposal includes the scissors, we can both get points. Alternatively, if they propose something else, maybe not. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I should try to get as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose all items. But then the other player can't get anything. But if their proposal is also all items, then we can't both have them. So that would result in zero. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the thimble and one scissor. Then, if the other player's proposal includes the remaining two scissors and the fork, then we can both get points. My score would be 6+1=7, their score would be 1+1+1=3. Total 10. That's better than if I take nothing. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and the fork. Then, if the other player's proposal includes the three scissors, then we can both get points. My score would be 6+1=7, their score would be 3*1=3. Total 10. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and two scissors. Then, if the other player's proposal includes the remaining scissor and the fork, then we can both get points. My score would be 6+2=8, their score would be 1+1=2. Total 10. That's better. Wait, but the other player's proposal might not include the fork. So if I take two scissors and the thimble, and they take the remaining scissor and the fork, then yes. But if they take something else, maybe not.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. The key is that the sum of both scores is maximized. So the best possible sum would be if all items are distributed. The total value for me would be 6 (thimble) + 3*1 (scissors) +1 (fork) = 10. But if the other player's proposal is such that they can take some items, then the sum would be higher. Wait, no. The sum is my value plus their value. So if I take the thimble and two scissors (value 6+2=8), and they take the remaining scissor and the fork (1+1=2), total is 10. If I take the thimble and the fork (7), and they take three scissors (3), total is 10. Either way, the total is 10. But if I take all items, then the other player can't take anything, so total is 10 (my value) + 0 =10. So same total. But if I take nothing, and they take everything, then total is 0 + 10=10. So in all cases, the maximum possible sum is 10. But the problem is that if our proposals are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other's.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose a set that covers as much as possible, but leaves some items for the other player. For example, if I propose the thimble and two scissors, then the other player can take the remaining scissor and the fork. That would be complementary. So my proposal would be [thimble, scissors, scissors]. But the format requires numbers and object names. So the proposal would be \"[Proposal: 1 thimble, 2 scissors]\".\n\nAlternatively, if I propose [thimble, fork], then the other player can take the three scissors. That would also be complementary. So my proposal would be \"[Proposal: 1 thimble, 1 fork]\".\n\nWhich of these is better? Well, if the other player's proposal is to take the three scissors, then my proposal of thimble and fork would be complementary. If their proposal is to take the thimble and two scissors, then my proposal of thimble and fork would not be complementary. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's proposal is something that I can respond to. But since I don't have that information, perhaps the best I can do is to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving some items for the other player. Since the thimble is the most valuable to me, I should definitely take that. Then, maybe take some scissors. But how many?\n\nIf I take the thimble and one scissor, then the other player can take two scissors and the fork. That would be complementary. My value is 6+1=7, their value is 2+1=3. Total 10. If I take the thimble and two scissors, then the other player can take one scissor and the fork. My value 6+2=8, their 1+1=2. Total 10. If I take the thimble and three scissors, then the other player can't take anything. So total is 6+3=9 + 0=9. Which is worse. So taking two scissors is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the thimble and the fork, then the other player can take three scissors. My value 7, their 3. Total 10. Same as before.\n\nSo the best I can do is to propose either [thimble, two scissors] or [thimble, fork], or [thimble, one scissor]. All of these would result in a total of 10 if the other player's proposal is complementary. But if their proposal is not, then we get zero. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.\n\nBut since the other player's proposal is secret, maybe they are also trying to maximize their own value. So perhaps they would propose the thimble and some scissors. If I propose the thimble and two scissors, and they propose the thimble and one scissor, then we can't both have the thimble. So that would be a conflict. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose the thimble and two scissors, and they propose the thimble and the fork, then we can't both have the thimble. So again, conflict. So that's bad.\n\nSo maybe the best approach is to propose items that are not overlapping with what the other player might propose. But without knowing their proposal, it's impossible. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, perhaps the best is to propose the thimble and the fork, leaving the scissors for the other player. Because the thimble is the highest value item for me, and the fork is 1. If the other player's proposal includes the scissors, then we can both get points. If their proposal is something else, maybe not. But this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and one scissor. Then, if the other player's proposal includes the remaining two scissors and the fork, that's good. If they propose something else, maybe not. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the thimble and the fork. That way, if the other player's proposal includes the three scissors, then we can both get points. If their proposal includes the thimble, then we can't. But since the thimble is valuable to me, I need to take it. So maybe the best is to take the thimble and the fork, and leave the scissors for the other player. That way, if they take the scissors, we can both get points. If they take something else, maybe not. But this is the best I can do with the information given.\n\nSo my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 thimble, 1 fork]. That's the format required. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal must be in square brackets with the format. So I need to write that. But the user said not to use square brackets when communicating, but for the secret proposal, use the format. So I should output that.\n"
