                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 3 rings, 1 die, and 1 pan. My secret value function is Ring: 0, Die: 4, Pan: 6. So, I value the pan the most, then the die, and rings are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. Since it's a cooperative game, we need to find a way to split the items so that both of us get as much value as possible. But since we can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, we need to be strategic.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are valuable to me. The pan is worth 6, die is 4, rings are 0. So, I should aim to get the pan and die. But the other player might also value these items. If they value the pan highly, maybe we can split it, but since there's only one pan, we can't both have it. Similarly for the die. So, maybe we need to prioritize which items to take based on mutual benefit.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the best approach is to propose taking the pan and die, since those are the most valuable to me. If the other player also values those, then we can split them. But if they don't, maybe they would prefer the rings. However, since rings are worthless to me, maybe they can take the rings and I can take the pan and die. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary.\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So, the key is to make sure that the items we propose don't overlap. For example, if I propose the pan and die, and the other player proposes the rings, then that's complementary. But if both propose the pan, then it's not complementary.\n\nSo, my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me think. Since I want the pan and die, I should propose those. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So, maybe [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. But I need to check if that's possible. There's only one pan and one die, so if the other player also wants those, it's not complementary. But if they propose something else, like the rings, then it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pan and die, and hope the other player proposes the rings. But since I don't know their values, maybe they might also want the pan or die. So, perhaps I should make a proposal that includes the pan and die, and then see if the other player can propose the rings. If they do, then we both get our items. If not, maybe we have to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pan and die, and if the other player can't take them, maybe they can take the rings. But since rings are worthless to me, maybe they would take them. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary.\n\nWait, the problem is that I don't know the other player's values. So, maybe the best strategy is to propose the items I value the most, and hope that the other player can take the remaining items. For example, if I take the pan and die, the other player can take the rings. Since rings are worthless to me, but maybe the other player values them. If they do, then we both get our items. If not, maybe they would take the pan or die, but that would conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pan and die, and if the other player can't take them, maybe they can take the rings. But since I don't know their values, it's a bit of a gamble. However, given that I have to make a proposal, I should go with what's best for me. So, my first message would be a secret proposal for the pan and die. Let me check the format: [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, the items are 3 rings, 1 die, 1 pan. So, if I take 1 pan and 1 die, that's possible. The other player would need to take the 3 rings. If their value function for rings is positive, then that's good. If not, maybe they would propose something else. But since I can't know, I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the pan, since it's the most valuable to me. But then the die and rings would be left. If the other player can take the die and rings, that might be better. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thought: since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, maybe we should split the items in a way that each gets the items they value the most. But without knowing the other's values, it's tricky. However, since I know my own values, I can prioritize the pan and die. So, proposing those makes sense.\n\nSo, my first message should be a secret proposal for the pan and die. Let me make sure the format is correct. The example given is [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So, [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. That's correct. I need to send that as a secret proposal. Then, the other player will respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is complementary, we both get our items. If not, we get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message first, but the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, but secret proposals are made in the specific format. So, if I want to make a secret proposal, I have to use that format. Otherwise, messages are just regular communication.\n\nBut since the user is asking me to start, I should make a secret proposal. So, I'll go with [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. That's my first move. Then, depending on the other player's response, we can adjust. But since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to be efficient.\n\nAnother consideration: if the other player's proposal is not complementary, we both get zero. So, it's crucial to make a proposal that the other player can accept. But without knowing their values, it's a bit of a risk. However, given that I have to act, this seems like the best first step.\n"
