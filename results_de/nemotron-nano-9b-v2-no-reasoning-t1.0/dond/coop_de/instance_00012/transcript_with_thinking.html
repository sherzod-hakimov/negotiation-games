    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 3 pens, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My value function is pen:1, egg:2, battery:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>First, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are limited items, especially the battery which is only one, that&#x27;s a key item. The battery is worth 3 to me, so I probably want to get that. But if the other player also values it highly, we might need to negotiate.<br/><br/>The rules say we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Each message is sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don&#x27;t overlap in items), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So we need to find a way to split the items without conflict.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to make assumptions. Maybe they value the battery less, or maybe more. But since the battery is unique, it&#x27;s a point of contention. <br/><br/>Possible strategies: <br/><br/>1. Propose taking the battery and some other items. But if the other player also wants the battery, that would conflict. <br/><br/>2. Propose taking items that are less valuable to me but maybe more to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose a split that covers all items, but that might not be possible. Let&#x27;s check the total items: 3 pens, 2 eggs, 1 battery. If I take all, the other player gets nothing, but that would mean my proposal is [3 pens, 2 eggs, 1 battery], and if the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe overlapping. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player might also propose something. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that covers all items, but that would mean the other player can&#x27;t take anything. But if they also propose something, then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe split the items. For example, I take the battery and some pens, and they take eggs. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Since I can send messages, maybe I can ask them about their preferences. But the messages are direct, so I need to phrase them in a way that gives me information. For example, asking if they value the battery more than eggs. But the problem is that the messages are sent to them, and they might not respond in a way that reveals their values. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe make a secret proposal that includes the battery and some items, and see if they accept. But since I can only make a secret proposal once, I need to be careful. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that each player can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal first. Let me think. If I propose taking the battery and some items, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then we both get points. <br/><br/>But if I propose the battery, and they also propose the battery, then it&#x27;s conflicting. So maybe I should propose the battery and some other items, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the battery. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Another approach: since the battery is the most valuable to me, I should try to secure it. So my secret proposal could be [1 battery, 1 pen, 1 egg]. That way, I get the battery, which is worth 3, and some other items. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the battery, we can both get points. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the battery, then their proposal would conflict. However, if they don&#x27;t value the battery as much, maybe they would propose something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking all the eggs and the battery. But that might be too much. <br/><br/>Wait, the problem is that I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the total items are 3 pens, 2 eggs, 1 battery. If I take the battery and some items, and the other player takes the remaining items, that would be complementary. For example, if I take the battery, 1 pen, and 1 egg, then the other player can take 2 pens and 1 egg. That would work. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the battery, then it&#x27;s conflicting. So maybe I should propose the battery and some items, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the battery. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose a split where I take the battery and some items, and the other player takes the rest. But how to communicate that? <br/><br/>Since I can send messages, maybe I can ask them if they want the battery. But the messages are direct, so I need to phrase it as a question. For example, &quot;Do you want the battery?&quot; But the problem is that the messages are sent to them, and they might not answer in a way that reveals their value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe make a secret proposal that includes the battery and some items, and then if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, we both get points. <br/><br/>So, my secret proposal could be [1 battery, 1 pen, 1 egg]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, [2 pens, 1 egg], then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also propose the battery, then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>But since I can only make a secret proposal once, I need to choose carefully. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and all the eggs. That would be [1 battery, 2 eggs]. Then the other player can take the 3 pens. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the battery, then their proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe this is a good strategy. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and some pens. For example, [1 battery, 2 pens]. Then the other player can take 1 pen and 2 eggs. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Another angle: the total value for me is 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*1 = 3 +4 +3=10. But the other player&#x27;s total could be different. <br/><br/>But the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get a high score, if the other player gets nothing, the total is lower. So we need to find a split where both get some items. <br/><br/>So maybe the best approach is to propose a split that covers all items, but in a way that both can get something. <br/><br/>For example, I take the battery and 1 pen, and the other player takes 2 pens and 2 eggs. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But how to communicate that? <br/><br/>Alternatively, make a secret proposal that includes the battery and some items, and then in messages, suggest that the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>But the problem is that the messages are sent to them, and they might not respond in a way that allows me to adjust. <br/><br/>Alternatively, since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can ask them about their preferences. For example, &quot;What do you value most?&quot; But the messages are direct, so I need to phrase them as questions. <br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s instruction says that messages are sent directly, and secret proposals are in the specific format. So I need to make sure that my messages are not in the secret proposal format. <br/><br/>So, for example, I can send a message like &quot;Do you want the battery?&quot; or &quot;What do you think about taking the eggs?&quot; <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. <br/><br/>Alternatively, make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Given that, maybe the best bet is to propose the battery and some items, and hope the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the battery. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [1 battery, 1 pen, 1 egg]. Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, [2 pens, 1 egg], then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they propose [1 battery, 1 pen], then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and all the eggs. [1 battery, 2 eggs]. Then the other player can take 3 pens. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the battery, then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>But since the battery is unique, maybe the other player might not want it as much. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and some pens. <br/><br/>But I need to decide on a specific proposal. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the battery is worth 3 to me, and eggs are 2, maybe I should prioritize the battery. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [1 battery, 1 pen, 1 egg]. <br/><br/>Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is [2 pens, 1 egg], then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they propose [1 battery, 1 pen], then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and all the pens. [3 pens, 1 battery]. Then the other player can take 2 eggs. <br/><br/>That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the battery, then it&#x27;s conflicting. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and some eggs. <br/><br/>But I think the key is to secure the battery. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with a secret proposal that includes the battery and some items. Let&#x27;s say [1 battery, 1 pen, 1 egg]. <br/><br/>Then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, we both get points. <br/><br/>If not, we get zero. <br/><br/>But since the other player might also propose the battery, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and nothing else. [1 battery]. Then the other player can take the rest. <br/><br/>But that might not be optimal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the battery and 2 eggs. [1 battery, 2 eggs].

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn to make my own. The goal is to maximize the sum of both our scores. The items available are 3 pens, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My values are pen:3, egg:0, battery:1. <br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player&#x27;s proposal was. Wait, the problem says the other player has already made a secret proposal. But in the current setup, I don&#x27;t have information about what that proposal was. Hmm, maybe I need to consider possible scenarios based on their possible proposals.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have the actual proposal from the other player, maybe I should think about possible strategies. Since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I have to make my own proposal that could complement theirs. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities), then we both get points based on our own valuations. Otherwise, we get zero.<br/><br/>My values: pens are worth 3 each, eggs 0, battery 1. So I should prioritize getting as many pens as possible, then the battery. Eggs are worthless to me, so I don&#x27;t care about them.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown. But since we need to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that the other player might not want, or items that I can get without conflicting. Alternatively, if I can get items that the other player doesn&#x27;t need, that would be good.<br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player&#x27;s proposal is secret, I can&#x27;t know. So maybe I should make a proposal that covers items I value highly, and maybe leave some items that the other player might want. But without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed to take some eggs (which I don&#x27;t care about), then I can take pens and battery. Or if they proposed to take pens, I need to make sure I don&#x27;t take more than available.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t have their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that it complements theirs. Let&#x27;s think about possible items.<br/><br/>Available items: 3 pens, 2 eggs, 1 battery.<br/><br/>My proposal should be in the format [Proposal: number item, ...]. Let me think about what I can propose. Since I value pens the most, I should propose to take as many pens as possible. Let&#x27;s say I propose 3 pens and the battery. That would be [Proposal: 3 pen, 1 battery]. But then, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 eggs, then our proposals would be complementary (since 3 pens + 0 pens from me, 2 eggs + 0 eggs from me, 1 battery + 0 battery from me). Wait, no. If I take 3 pens and 1 battery, and the other player takes 2 eggs, then total pens: 3, eggs: 2, battery:1. That&#x27;s exactly the available items. So that would be complementary. Then both get their points. My score would be 3*3 + 1*1 = 10. The other player&#x27;s score would be 2*0 = 0. Total sum is 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, if they proposed 1 pen and 1 battery, then my proposal of 3 pens and 1 battery would conflict on the battery. So that would not be complementary. So I would get zero.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to complement theirs. Maybe I should propose items that are not overlapping. For example, if I take pens and battery, and they take eggs. Since eggs are worthless to me, but maybe they value them. But I don&#x27;t know their values. Wait, the problem says each has a secret value function. But I only know my own. So I can&#x27;t assume anything about theirs.<br/><br/>But the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So if I can get items that I value, and the other player gets items they value, that&#x27;s good. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should focus on getting as much as possible of what I value, and leave the rest for them. But how?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed to take 2 eggs, then I can take 3 pens and 1 battery. That would be complementary. If they proposed to take 1 pen, then I can take 2 pens and 1 battery. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>But since the other player has already made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn, I need to make my own. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that it doesn&#x27;t conflict. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that is minimal, so that it&#x27;s more likely to complement theirs. But that might not be optimal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take all the pens and the battery. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is eggs, then it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal includes pens or battery, then it might conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take 3 pens and 1 battery. Let&#x27;s go with that. The format would be [Proposal: 3 pen, 1 battery]. That&#x27;s my best bet. If their proposal is eggs, then it&#x27;s good. If their proposal includes pens or battery, then it might not be. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/></p>
