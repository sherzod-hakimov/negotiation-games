                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 2 pens, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. My secret value function is pen:4, shoe:1, fruit:0. So pens are really valuable to me, shoes a bit, and fruits not at all.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they also value pens highly, or maybe shoes more. But since I don't know, I need to propose something that could be mutually beneficial.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we get zero. So the key is to find a proposal that the other player would accept, and that together we can cover all items without overlap.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to start by communicating. But the first move is to make a secret proposal. Wait, the instructions say that each player is asked to make a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making my secret proposal first.\n\nBut how to structure it. The secret proposal should list the items I want in brackets. For example, [Proposal: 1 pen, 1 shoe]. But I need to think about what to propose. Since pens are worth 4 each to me, I should try to get as many pens as possible. But if the other player also wants pens, we might have a conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking all pens and some shoes, but that might not be good if the other player also wants pens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking all pens and some shoes, but if the other player's proposal complements that, then we can both get points. But if they also want pens, then it's a conflict. So perhaps I need to propose a combination that leaves some items for the other player.\n\nWait, the items are 2 pens, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So total of 6 items. If I take 2 pens and 1 shoe, that's 3 items. The other player could take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. But if their value function is different, maybe they would prefer different items.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let me think. If I propose taking 2 pens and 1 shoe, then the other player could take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. That would use all items. But if their value function is such that they value shoes more, maybe they would take 2 shoes and 1 pen. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 pen and 1 shoe. Then the other player could take 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 pens and 2 shoes. But that would leave 2 fruits. If the other player's proposal includes 2 fruits, then it's complementary. But if they also want shoes or pens, it might not work.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is as attractive as possible. Since pens are high value for me, I should prioritize getting pens. So maybe propose 2 pens and 1 shoe. Then, if the other player's proposal includes 1 shoe and 2 fruits, that would work. But if they want more shoes or pens, it might not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 1 fruit. But since fruits are worthless to me, that's not ideal. But maybe the other player values fruits. However, without knowing, it's risky.\n\nAnother approach: since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, maybe we should aim for a proposal that allows both of us to get as much as possible. For example, if I take 2 pens and 1 shoe, and the other takes 1 shoe and 2 fruits, then my score would be 2*4 + 1*1 = 9, and theirs would be 1*1 + 2*0 = 1. Total 10. Alternatively, if I take 1 pen and 2 shoes, my score is 4 + 2*1 = 6, and if they take 1 pen and 2 fruits, their score is 4 + 0 = 4. Total 10. Same total. But maybe there's a better combination.\n\nWait, but if I take 2 pens and 2 shoes, that's 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. Then the other player would need to take 2 fruits. Their score would be 0. Total 10. But if they can take something else, maybe better. But if they don't want fruits, they might not accept. But since I don't know, maybe this is a safe proposal.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose 2 pens and 1 shoe, and they propose 1 shoe and 2 fruits, that's complementary. My score 9, theirs 1. Total 10. If I propose 1 pen and 2 shoes, and they propose 1 pen and 2 fruits, same total. But maybe there's a way to get a higher total.\n\nWait, what if I take 2 pens and 1 shoe, and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. That's 3 items each. But if they take 2 shoes and 1 pen, that's 2*1 + 4 = 6 for them, and I get 2*4 + 1*1 = 9. Total 15. That's better. But that would require that their proposal is 2 shoes and 1 pen. But I don't know if they would propose that. Since their value function is secret, I can't be sure. But maybe I should propose something that allows for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 1 shoe, and hope that the other player's proposal is 1 shoe and 2 fruits. But if they propose something else, like 2 shoes and 1 pen, then we can both get more. But since I can't know, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is flexible. For example, [Proposal: 1 pen, 1 shoe]. Then the other player could propose 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. But that would require that they have 1 pen and 1 shoe left. But since there are 2 pens and 2 shoes, if I take 1 pen and 1 shoe, they can take 1 pen and 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That would be complementary. My score would be 4 + 1 = 5, theirs would be 4 + 1 + 0 = 5. Total 10. That's better than the previous 10. Wait, but if I take 1 pen and 1 shoe, and they take 1 pen and 1 shoe, that's 2 pens and 2 shoes, leaving 2 fruits. So that's complementary. So that's a good scenario.\n\nBut if I propose 1 pen and 1 shoe, and they propose 1 pen and 1 shoe, then we both get 5 each. Total 10. Alternatively, if I propose 2 pens and 1 shoe, and they propose 1 shoe and 2 fruits, that's 9 + 1 = 10. So same total. But maybe there's a way to get higher.\n\nWait, what if I take 2 pens and 2 shoes. That's 2*4 + 2*1 = 10. Then the other player takes 2 fruits. Their score is 0. Total 10. But if they can take something else, maybe better. But if they don't value fruits, they might not accept. But if they do, then it's 10. Alternatively, if I take 1 pen and 2 shoes, and they take 1 pen and 2 fruits, that's 4 + 2*1 = 6 for me, and 4 + 0 = 4 for them. Total 10. Same.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 1 fruit. My score is 4 + 1 + 0 = 5. If they take 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 1 fruit, their score is 4 + 1 + 0 = 5. Total 10. But that's the same as before.\n\nSo regardless of the proposal, the maximum total seems to be 10. But maybe there's a way to get higher. Wait, if I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (9), and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits (1), total 10. If I take 1 pen and 2 shoes (6), and they take 1 pen and 2 fruits (4), total 10. If I take 2 pens and 2 shoes (10), and they take 2 fruits (0), total 10. So all these scenarios give 10. Is there a way to get more?\n\nWait, what if I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (9), and they take 1 pen and 2 shoes (4 + 2*1 = 6). Then total is 15. But that would require that they propose 1 pen and 2 shoes. But I don't know if they would. Since their value function is secret, I can't be sure. But if I can get them to propose that, then it's better. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose something that allows for that. For example, if I propose 2 pens and 1 shoe, and they propose 1 pen and 2 shoes, then we can both get more. But how to communicate that. Since I can only make a secret proposal, maybe I need to make a proposal that is attractive to them. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is 2 pens and 1 shoe. Then, if the other player's proposal is 1 pen and 2 shoes, that would be complementary. But if they propose something else, like 2 shoes and 1 pen, then it's also complementary. Wait, 2 pens and 1 shoe from me, and 1 pen and 2 shoes from them. That would require 3 pens and 3 shoes, but there are only 2 pens and 2 shoes. So that's not possible. So that's a conflict. So that's not complementary.\n\nSo the key is that the proposals must not overlap in items. So if I take 2 pens and 1 shoe, the other player can take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. That's 2 pens, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. All items are used. So that's complementary. So that's a valid scenario.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 1 pen and 2 shoes, and they take 1 pen and 2 fruits. That's also complementary. So in that case, my score is 4 + 2*1 = 6, theirs is 4 + 0 = 4. Total 10.\n\nSo the maximum possible total is 10. But maybe there's a way to get higher. Wait, if I take 2 pens and 2 shoes (10), and they take 2 fruits (0), total 10. If I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (9), and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits (1), total 10. So same.\n\nBut what if I take 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 1 fruit. Then they take 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 1 fruit. That's 2 pens, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. My score is 4 + 1 + 0 = 5, theirs is 4 + 1 + 0 = 5. Total 10. Same.\n\nSo no matter what, the maximum total seems to be 10. But maybe there's a way to get more. Wait, what if I take 2 pens and 2 shoes (10), and they take 2 fruits (0). Total 10. If I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (9), and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits (1). Total 10. If I take 1 pen and 2 shoes (6), and they take 1 pen and 2 fruits (4). Total 10. So all these scenarios give 10. So maybe 10 is the maximum possible.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to get more. Wait, if I take 2 pens and 2 shoes (10), and they take 2 fruits (0). Total 10. If I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (9), and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits (1). Total 10. If I take 1 pen and 2 shoes (6), and they take 1 pen and 2 fruits (4). Total 10. So no, it's always 10. So the maximum possible is 10.\n\nBut maybe the other player's value function is different. For example, if they value shoes more. Suppose their value function is shoe:5, pen:1, fruit:0. Then if I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (4*2 + 1*1 = 9), and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits (5*1 + 0 = 5). Total 14. That's better. But since I don't know their values, I can't be sure. But the problem is that I have to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted, and that when combined with their proposal, gives a high total.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is as attractive as possible. Since pens are high for me, I should try to get as many as possible. So proposing 2 pens and 1 shoe. Then, if the other player's proposal is 1 shoe and 2 fruits, that's complementary. My score 9, theirs 1. Total 10. Alternatively, if they propose 2 shoes and 1 pen, then I get 9, they get 2*1 + 4 = 6. Total 15. But that's better. But I can't know if they would propose that.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe I should make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. For example, if I propose 2 pens and 1 shoe, and they might accept if they can get some shoes. Alternatively, if I propose 1 pen and 1 shoe, maybe they can take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is 2 pens and 1 shoe. That's my best bet. Then, if the other player's proposal is 1 shoe and 2 fruits, we get 10. If they propose something else, maybe we can't get a better deal. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 1 pen and 2 shoes. That's 4 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 1 pen and 2 fruits. Their score would be 4 + 0 = 4. Total 10. Same as before.\n\nSo regardless of the proposal, the total seems to be 10. But maybe there's a way to get more. Wait, what if I take 2 pens and 2 shoes (10), and they take 2 fruits (0). Total 10. If I take 2 pens and 1 shoe (9), and they take 1 shoe and 2 fruits (1). Total 10. If I take 1 pen and 2 shoes (6), and they take 1 pen and 2 fruits (4). Total 10. So no, it's always 10. So the maximum possible is 10.\n\nTherefore, my secret proposal should be something that allows for this. So I should propose 2 pens and 1 shoe. That way, if the other player's proposal is 1 shoe and 2 fruits, we get 10. Alternatively, if they propose 2 shoes and 1 pen, but that would require 3 shoes, which isn't possible. So that's not possible. So the best I can do is propose 2 pens and 1 shoe. Then, if the other player's proposal is 1 shoe and 2 fruits, we get 10. If they propose something else, maybe we can't get a better deal. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose 1 pen and 1 shoe. Then the other player could take 1 pen, 1 shoe, and 2 fruits. That would be complementary. My score 5, theirs 5. Total 10. Same as before.\n\nSo either way, the total is 10. So maybe the best approach is to propose 2 pens and 1 shoe. That way, I maximize my own score, and if the other player's proposal is compatible, we get 10. If not, maybe we get less. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 pens, 1 shoe]. That's the best I can think of.\n"
