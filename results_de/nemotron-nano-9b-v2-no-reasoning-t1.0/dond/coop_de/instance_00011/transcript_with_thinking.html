        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 1 Ring, 3 Fruits, and 1 Coin. My secret value function is Ring:6, Fruit:1, Coin:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>First, I should consider possible strategies. Since we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to decide when to propose. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don&#x27;t overlap in items), we both get points based on our own valuations. Otherwise, we get zero. So the challenge is to find a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, given their unknown valuations.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value the Ring highly, or maybe they prefer Fruits or Coins. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to propose something that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals. If I propose to take the Ring and some Fruits, maybe the other player would take the Coin and the remaining Fruits. But if they value the Ring more, they might not accept. Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and some Fruits, maybe they take the Ring. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Another approach is to propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. For example, if I propose to take the Coin and some Fruits, which are low value for me, but maybe the other player values the Coin more. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and the Coin, but that might not be complementary if the other player also wants those. Wait, but there&#x27;s only one Ring and one Coin. So if I take both, the other player can&#x27;t take them. But if I propose that, and they propose something else, maybe it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the Ring or Coin, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem says that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose [Ring, Fruit], and they propose [Coin, Fruit], then since there are 3 Fruits, maybe that&#x27;s okay? Wait, no. The items are 1 Ring, 3 Fruits, 1 Coin. So if I take 1 Fruit and the Ring, and they take 1 Fruit and the Coin, then there are still 1 Fruit left. But the proposals need to be complementary, meaning that the total items in both proposals don&#x27;t exceed the available items. So if I take 1 Fruit and the Ring, and they take 1 Fruit and the Coin, that&#x27;s 2 Fruits, 1 Ring, 1 Coin. Which is within the available items. So that would be complementary. Then both get their items. <br/><br/>But if I propose [Ring, Fruit], and they propose [Coin, Fruit], then that&#x27;s okay. But if I propose [Ring, Fruit, Fruit], and they propose [Coin, Fruit], then that&#x27;s 2 Fruits from me and 1 from them, total 3, which is okay. So that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is unknown. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with theirs. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and some Fruits, and hope that they take the Ring. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the sum of both scores is to be maximized, maybe the best outcome is when both get as much as possible. But since the items are limited, we need to split them. <br/><br/>If I propose to take the Ring and the Coin, that&#x27;s 2 items. Then the other player could take the 3 Fruits. That would be complementary. But if they don&#x27;t want the Coin, maybe they would take the Ring instead. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 2 Fruits, and they take the Ring and 1 Fruit. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But how to decide? Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. For example, if I propose to take the Coin and 2 Fruits (which are low value for me), maybe the other player would take the Ring and 1 Fruit. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit, and they take the Coin and 2 Fruits. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe the best approach is to propose items that are not too valuable to me, so that the other player might be willing to take the rest. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is also a secret. So maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, but also leaves enough items for the other player to take something they value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits. That would leave the Ring for the other player. If they value the Ring highly, they would take it. But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take something else. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits, that would leave the Coin for the other player. But if they value the Coin more, they would take it. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Another angle: since the sum of both scores is to be maximized, maybe the optimal is when both get as much as possible. But given the items, the maximum possible sum would be if both get all items, but that&#x27;s impossible. So the best is to split the items in a way that both get high-value items. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think about what to propose. <br/><br/>If I propose [Ring, Fruit], that&#x27;s 1 Ring and 1 Fruit. Then the other player could propose [Coin, 2 Fruits]. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Coin, 2 Fruits], and they propose [Ring, 1 Fruit], that&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>But which one is better? It depends on their values. <br/><br/>Since I value the Ring highly (6), I might want to take it. But if the other player also values it, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, which are low value for me (1+3*1=4), but maybe the other player values the Coin more. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and the Coin. That&#x27;s 2 items. Then the other player can take the 3 Fruits. If they value the Fruits, that&#x27;s good. But if they value the Coin or Ring more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a risky proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and 1 Fruit. Then the other player could take the Ring and 2 Fruits. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Since the problem allows up to 5 messages, maybe I should first send some messages to gather information. But the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and they are direct. However, the user hasn&#x27;t provided any previous messages, so this is the first move. <br/><br/>Wait, the user is starting the game. So I need to make my first move. The options are to send a message or make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s instruction says that if it&#x27;s not a secret proposal, the message is sent directly. So maybe I should first send a message to the other player to get some information. But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s responses are not known. <br/><br/>Alternatively, since I can make a secret proposal, maybe I should do that. <br/><br/>But what should I propose? <br/><br/>If I propose [Ring, Fruit], that&#x27;s 1 Ring and 1 Fruit. If the other player proposes [Coin, 2 Fruits], then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Coin, 2 Fruits], and they propose [Ring, 1 Fruit], that&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>But which one is better? <br/><br/>Since I value the Ring highly, I might want to take it. But if the other player also values it, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, which is 1+3=4 points for me. Then the other player could take the Ring. If they value the Ring highly, they would take it. <br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits, that&#x27;s 6+3=9 points for me. Then the other player takes the Coin. If they value the Coin, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to propose items that are high value for me and leave items that are high value for them. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an educated guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits. That&#x27;s 1+3=4 points for me. Then the other player can take the Ring. If they value the Ring, they get 6, so total sum is 4+6=10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Ring and 3 Fruits, that&#x27;s 6+3=9, and the other player takes the Coin (1 point). Total sum 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>But if I take the Ring and 1 Fruit (6+1=7), and the other player takes the Coin and 2 Fruits (1+2=3), total 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>So regardless of how I split, the maximum possible sum is 10. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if the proposals are not complementary, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and the other player&#x27;s proposal are complementary. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits. Then the other player can take the Ring. If they do, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits, the other player takes the Coin. <br/><br/>Either way, the sum is 10. <br/><br/>But if I propose something else, like [Fruit, Fruit], then the other player might take the Ring and Coin, which is complementary. <br/><br/>But in that case, my score would be 2, and theirs 6+1=7, total 9. Which is less than 10. <br/><br/>So the best is to propose either the Ring and some Fruits or the Coin and some Fruits. <br/><br/>But which one? <br/><br/>Since I value the Ring highly, I might want to take it. But if the other player also values it, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, which is low for me, but maybe the other player values the Coin more. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a 50-50. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit. That&#x27;s 7 points for me. Then the other player can take the Coin and 2 Fruits (3 points). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 2 Fruits (3 points), and they take the Ring and 1 Fruit (7 points). Same total. <br/><br/>So either way, the maximum possible sum is 10. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal is not complementary, we both get zero. <br/><br/>So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest is to propose items that are not too valuable to me, so that the other player is more likely to take the rest. <br/><br/>For example, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits (4 points), then the other player can take the Ring (6 points). That&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit (7 points), and they take the Coin and 2 Fruits (3 points). <br/><br/>Either way, the sum is 10. <br/><br/>But if I propose something else, like [Fruit, Fruit], and they propose [Ring, Coin], that&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>But my score would be 2, theirs 7, total 9. <br/><br/>So the best is to propose either the Ring and some Fruits or the Coin and some Fruits. <br/><br/>But which one? <br/><br/>Since I value the Ring more, I might prefer to take it. But if the other player also values it, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, which is low for me, but maybe the other player values the Coin more. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says that to make a secret proposal, use the format [Proposal: ...]. <br/><br/>So I need to decide what to propose. <br/><br/>Given that, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit. That&#x27;s 7 points for me. Then the other player can take the Coin and 2 Fruits. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, that&#x27;s 4 points. <br/><br/>But which is better? <br/><br/>If the other player values the Ring highly, then my first proposal would be better. If they value the Coin more, the second is better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should go with the first option, as the Ring is high value for me. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, to leave the Ring for them. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask about their values. But the rules say that messages are sent directly, and I can&#x27;t ask questions. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, but the user hasn&#x27;t provided any previous messages. So this is the first move. <br/><br/>So I need to decide whether to send a message or make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>If I send a message, maybe I can ask them to propose something. But the problem is that the messages are direct, and I don&#x27;t know their response. <br/><br/>Alternatively, making a secret proposal might be better. <br/><br/>But which one? <br/><br/>Since the goal is to maximize the sum, and I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose items that are high value for me and leave items that are high value for them. <br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s impossible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits. That&#x27;s 4 points for me. If the other player takes the Ring, that&#x27;s 6. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Ring and 3 Fruits, that&#x27;s 9, and they take the Coin (1). Total 10. <br/><br/>Either way, the sum is 10. <br/><br/>But if I propose something else, like [Fruit, Fruit], and they propose [Ring, Coin], that&#x27;s 2+7=9. <br/><br/>So the maximum possible is 10. <br/><br/>Therefore, I should propose either the Ring and some Fruits or the Coin and some Fruits. <br/><br/>But which one? <br/><br/>Since I value the Ring more, I might prefer to take it. But if the other player also values it, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, which is low for me, but maybe the other player values the Coin more. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit. That&#x27;s 7 points. Then the other player can take the Coin and 2 Fruits. <br/><br/>That seems reasonable. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with that. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Ring, 1 Fruit]. <br/><br/>But I need to check the format. The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;item name&gt;, &lt;number&gt; &lt;item name&gt;, ...]. <br/><br/>So for example, [Proposal: 1 Ring, 1 Fruit]. <br/><br/>Yes. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 Coin, 3 Fruits]. <br/><br/>But which is better? <br/><br/>If I take the Ring and 1 Fruit, I get 7. If they take the Coin and 2 Fruits, they get 3. Total 10. <br/><br/>If I take the Coin and 3 Fruits, I get 4. They take the Ring, 6. Total 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>But if I take the Ring and 1 Fruit, and they take the Coin and 2 Fruits, that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Coin and 3 Fruits, and they take the Ring, that&#x27;s also complementary. <br/><br/>So both proposals are valid. <br/><br/>But since I value the Ring more, I might prefer to take it. <br/><br/>But if the other player also values the Ring, then my proposal would conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the Coin and 3 Fruits, which is less valuable to me, but maybe the other player values the Coin more. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit. <br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go with that. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal is [Proposal: 1 Ring, 1 Fruit].<br/></p>
