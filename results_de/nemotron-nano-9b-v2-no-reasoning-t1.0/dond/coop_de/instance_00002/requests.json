Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Telefon, 2 Spiegel, 2 Früchte\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nTelefon: 4, Spiegel: 2, Frucht: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. My value function is phone:4, mirror:2, fruit:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one phone, if both want it, there's a conflict. But maybe we can split the other items. The mirrors and fruits are in pairs, so maybe each can take one mirror and one fruit. But the phone is a single item. \n\nSince I don't know the other player's values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. If I propose taking the phone, maybe the other player would take the mirrors and fruits. But if they also want the phone, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the phone and some mirrors, and they take the rest. \n\nWait, the key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose [Phone, Mirror], and they propose [Mirror, Fruit], then together they have Phone, 2 Mirrors, 2 Fruits. That works. But if I propose [Phone, Mirror, Fruit], and they propose [Mirror, Fruit], then that's also complementary. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's attractive to them. Maybe I should propose the phone and some mirrors, since the phone is high value for me. But if they also value the phone, they might not accept. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and a mirror, and they can take the other mirror and fruits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and a fruit, and they take the mirrors. But I need to think about what's likely to be accepted. Since the other player's values are secret, I have to make an educated guess. \n\nAnother approach: since the total items are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, 2 fruits. If I take the phone, then the other player can take the mirrors and fruits. If I don't take the phone, maybe they take it. But if I take the phone, I get 4 points, and they get 2+1=3 (if they take both mirrors and fruits). Total 7. If I don't take the phone, maybe they take it, and I get mirrors and fruits. But if they take the phone, I get 2+1=3, and they get 4. Total 7 again. So maybe the total is the same. But maybe there's a way to get more. \n\nWait, but if I can get the phone and a mirror, and they get the other mirror and fruits, that's 4+2=6 for me, and 2+1=3 for them. Total 9. That's better. So maybe that's a good proposal. \n\nBut how to communicate that. I need to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So maybe I should propose [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror]. Then the other player might propose [Proposal: 1 Mirror, 2 Fruits]. That would be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror], and they propose [Proposal: 1 Mirror, 2 Fruits], that works. \n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is something they would accept. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the phone and a mirror, as that's high value for me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and a fruit, but that's lower value. \n\nAnother thought: since the other player's values are secret, maybe I should propose the phone and a mirror, and hope they take the rest. If they do, then we both get points. If not, we get zero. \n\nSo my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to send that. \n\nSo my first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me decide what to propose. Since I value the phone highly, I should include it. Then maybe a mirror. So [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe [Proposal: 1 Phone, 2 Mirrors], but there are only 2 mirrors. If I take both, then the other player can't take any. But if they also want mirrors, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror, 1 Fruit]. But that might be too much. \n\nBut the key is that the other player's proposal must complement mine. So if I take the phone and a mirror, they can take the other mirror and fruits. That's complementary. \n\nSo I think my first proposal should be [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror]. Then the other player might respond with their own proposal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the phone and a fruit, but that's less valuable. \n\nI think the best bet is to propose the phone and a mirror. Let me go with that.\n",
