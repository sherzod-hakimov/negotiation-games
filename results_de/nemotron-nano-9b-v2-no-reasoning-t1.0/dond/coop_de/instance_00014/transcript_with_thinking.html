        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, and 1 comb. My value function is mirrors:1, brick:4, knives:1, comb:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>First, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The brick is worth 4, which is the highest. Then mirrors, knives, and comb are all 1 each. So I should prioritize getting the brick. But since the other player might also value the brick highly, I need to negotiate.<br/><br/>The rules say we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Each message is sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format. If our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>So the key is to propose items that the other player might not want, or to split items in a way that both can get some high-value items. But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the other player also values the brick highly. If that&#x27;s the case, we need to split the brick, but there&#x27;s only one. So maybe one of us gets the brick, and the other gets other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player values something else more. For example, if they value mirrors more, then I could take the brick and they take mirrors. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Since I can send messages, maybe I should first try to communicate. But the problem is that messages are public, so the other player can see them. So if I send a message like &quot;I want the brick,&quot; they might respond accordingly. But since I can&#x27;t see their messages, I have to make my own proposals.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe making a secret proposal is better. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...], and if both are complementary, we get points. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some other items, hoping that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving room for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take the brick (4 points) and maybe some mirrors or knives, but leave the comb for them. But if they also want the brick, then my proposal would conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb, since the comb is only 1 point for me, but maybe the other player values it more. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Another approach: since the total items are limited, maybe the optimal is to split the items so that both get high-value items. For example, if I take the brick (4) and the comb (1), and the other player takes the mirrors (2*1=2) and knives (3*1=3), total would be 4+1+2+3=10. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they would prefer different items.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the brick and some items that I value, and hope the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Alternatively, make a secret proposal that includes the brick and maybe some other items, and see if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, the secret proposal is made by each player. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player also makes a secret proposal, and they are complementary, then we both get points. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that is as broad as possible, or that covers items that are less likely to be desired by the other player. For example, if I take the brick (which is high value for me), and maybe some items that are less valuable to me but maybe more to them. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best is to propose the brick and the comb, since the comb is only 1 point for me, but maybe the other player values it more. Or maybe propose the brick and the mirrors, but that might conflict if they also want the brick.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the knives, but again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should not take the brick and instead take other items, but that would be worse for me. Since the brick is worth 4, which is the highest, I should definitely try to get it.<br/><br/>So, considering that, maybe my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 comb]. That way, I get the brick (4) and the comb (1), total 5. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the brick or comb, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also want the brick, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 2 mirrors]. That would give me 4 + 2*1 = 6. But again, if the other player also wants the brick, it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 knife]. That&#x27;s 4 +1=5. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror, 1 knife]. That&#x27;s 4+1+1=6. But again, same problem.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s values are unknown, maybe the best is to propose the brick and some items that are less likely to be desired by them. For example, if they value the comb more, then I can take the brick and comb. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and then in the messages, I can try to communicate that I&#x27;m willing to give up some items for the brick. But since messages are public, maybe I can send a message like &quot;I want the brick, but I&#x27;m willing to give up some mirrors or knives for it.&quot; But the problem is that the other player might not respond in a way that&#x27;s helpful.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can send multiple messages to negotiate. For example, first message: &quot;I want the brick.&quot; Then the other player might respond with their proposal. But since I can&#x27;t see their messages, I have to make my own proposals.<br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, but I don&#x27;t get to see their responses. So I have to make my own proposals based on my own information. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some other items, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as specific as possible. For example, [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 comb]. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, [Proposal: 2 mirrors, 3 knives], then they are complementary, and we both get points. But if their proposal includes the brick, then it&#x27;s not.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe the other player also values the brick highly. In that case, my proposal would conflict. So maybe I should not take the brick and instead take other items. But that would be worse for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they don&#x27;t value the brick as much. For example, if they value mirrors more. Then I can take the brick and they take mirrors. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Another thought: since the total value of all items is 2*1 (mirrors) + 1*4 (brick) + 3*1 (knives) + 1*1 (comb) = 2 +4 +3 +1=10. If both players can get all items, the total would be 10. But since they have to split, the maximum possible sum is 10. But if they can&#x27;t agree, they get zero. So the goal is to get as close to 10 as possible.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving room for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take the brick (4) and the comb (1), that&#x27;s 5. If the other player takes the mirrors (2) and knives (3), that&#x27;s 5. Total 10. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they would prefer different items.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the brick and the comb, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include the brick. Alternatively, maybe propose the brick and some other items, and in messages, try to negotiate.<br/><br/>But since I can only send messages, and the other player can respond, but I can&#x27;t see their responses, I have to make my own proposals. So maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and then in messages, try to suggest that I&#x27;m willing to give up some items for the brick.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. For example, [Proposal: 1 brick, 2 mirrors, 3 knives, 1 comb]. But that&#x27;s all items, which would mean the other player can&#x27;t get anything, so it&#x27;s not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe split the items. For example, I take the brick and the comb, and the other player takes the mirrors and knives. That would be complementary. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb, and in messages, suggest that I&#x27;m willing to give up some mirrors or knives for the brick. But again, without knowing their response, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and then in messages, ask the other player if they want the brick. But since messages are public, they can respond, but I can&#x27;t see their response. So maybe I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and then in messages, try to communicate that I&#x27;m open to trading. For example, &quot;I want the brick, but I can give you some mirrors or knives in exchange.&quot; But again, without knowing their response, it&#x27;s uncertain.<br/><br/>In any case, the first step is to make a secret proposal. Since I can&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving some items for them. The brick is the most valuable to me, so I should definitely include it. Then, maybe include the comb, which is 1 point, but maybe the other player values it more. Alternatively, include some mirrors or knives.<br/><br/>But if I take the brick and the comb, that&#x27;s 5 points. If the other player takes the mirrors and knives, that&#x27;s 2+3=5. Total 10. That&#x27;s the maximum possible. So if I can get that, it&#x27;s good. But if the other player also wants the brick, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and some other items, and in messages, try to negotiate. For example, send a message like &quot;I want the brick. Are you willing to give me the comb in exchange for something?&quot; But again, without knowing their response, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the brick and the comb, and then in messages, suggest that I&#x27;m willing to give up some mirrors or knives for the brick. But again, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should not take the brick and instead take other items. For example, take 2 mirrors (2 points) and 3 knives (3 points), total 5. But that&#x27;s worse than taking the brick. So that&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>So, given that, the best bet is to take the brick. So my secret proposal should include the brick. Then, in messages, I can try to negotiate for other items. But since I can only send up to 5 messages, I need to be efficient.<br/><br/>So, first, I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal. Let&#x27;s say [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 comb]. That gives me 4+1=5. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, 2 mirrors and 3 knives, then it&#x27;s complementary. If their proposal includes the brick, then it&#x27;s not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 2 mirrors]. That&#x27;s 4+2=6. But again, same issue.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 knife]. 4+1=5.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the brick and the comb, as the comb is less likely to be desired by others. Or maybe the other player values the comb more. But I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and some items that are less valuable to me but maybe more to them. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some other items, and then use messages to negotiate. Since I can send up to 5 messages, I can try to communicate my preferences. For example, first message: &quot;I want the brick. Are you willing to give me the comb?&quot; Then, depending on their response (which I can&#x27;t see), I might adjust. But since I can&#x27;t see their responses, I have to make my own proposals.<br/><br/>But since the user is asking me to start the game, I need to make my first move. So I should make a secret proposal. Let me decide on that.<br/><br/>Given that, I&#x27;ll propose the brick and the comb. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 comb]. That&#x27;s my first move. Then, in subsequent messages, I can try to negotiate for other items, but since I can&#x27;t see their responses, I have to proceed with my own proposals.<br/></p>
