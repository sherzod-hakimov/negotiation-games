Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Bolzen, 1 Bild, 1 Ei, 4 Karten\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nBolzen: 6, Bild: 4, Ei: 0, Karte: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, and 4 cards. My secret value function is bolts:6, picture:4, egg:0, cards:0. So I really want the bolt and picture, and the egg and cards don't matter to me. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since we need to maximize the total sum, I should consider what they might value. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should assume they have different priorities. But since the problem is cooperative, we need to find a split where both get items they value. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items' values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we propose don't overlap. \n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and hope the other player does the same. But since I don't know their values, I need to think about possible scenarios.\n\nWait, but the other player's value function is secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I value bolts and pictures, maybe I should propose to take those. But if the other player also wants those, then the proposals would conflict. However, if I can get the bolt and picture, and the other player gets the egg and cards, which I don't care about, that would be good. But I don't know if the other player values the egg or cards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the egg or cards. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of a complementary split. \n\nAnother thought: since the total items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. If I take the bolt and picture, that's two items. The other player would need to take the egg and cards. But if the other player's value function is such that they don't care about the egg or cards, then their proposal might not include those. But if they do, then maybe they would propose to take the egg and cards. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the bolt and picture. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I should send that. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to make my first move. Since I can send messages or make a secret proposal. The first step is to either send a message or make a secret proposal. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the other player's value function. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the items I value. Let me think. If I propose to take the bolt and picture, then the other player would need to propose the egg and cards. If that's the case, then both would get their items. But if the other player's proposal includes some of the items I want, then it's not complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to coordinate. But the problem is that messages are public, so the other player can see them. But since I don't know their values, maybe it's better to make a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player also makes a secret proposal, and they are complementary, then we both get points. \n\nSo the optimal strategy would be to propose the items I value, and hope the other player proposes the remaining items. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the bolt and picture, and the other player might propose the egg and cards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the egg or cards. For example, if the other player values the egg, then they might want to take it. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that is as good as possible. \n\nAnother angle: since the total sum is the sum of both players' scores, and I want to maximize that. If I can get the bolt and picture, and the other player gets the egg and cards, then my score is 6+4=10, and the other player's score depends on their values. If they value the egg or cards, then their score would be higher. But if they don't, their score is zero. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best is to propose the bolt and picture. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Bolt, 1 Picture]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include those items. If they propose something else, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message first. For example, ask the other player what they value. But the problem is that messages are public, and the other player might not respond. Also, the user hasn't provided the other player's value function, so I can't know. \n\nBut according to the rules, I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Since I can make a secret proposal, maybe that's the best first step. \n\nSo I think the best move is to make a secret proposal for the bolt and picture. That way, if the other player's proposal is the egg and cards, we both get our items. If not, we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, this is a risk. However, given that I value those items highly, it's worth the risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the bolt and picture, and also the egg and cards. But that would be taking all items, which would make the other player's proposal impossible. But that would result in both getting zero. So that's bad. \n\nSo the best is to propose the items I value, and hope the other player proposes the rest. \n\nTherefore, my first action should be to make a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Bolt, 1 Picture].\n",
