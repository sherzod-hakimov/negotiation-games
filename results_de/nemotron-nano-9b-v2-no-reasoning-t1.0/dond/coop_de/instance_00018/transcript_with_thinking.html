        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, and 2 potatoes. Both players have secret value functions, but in this case, my value function is given as all items worth 2 each. The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t specified, so I have to assume it&#x27;s different, but maybe similar? Or maybe it&#x27;s arbitrary. Hmm.<br/><br/>The rules say that we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: number item, ...]. If the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get points based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player will accept, ensuring that the items are split without conflict.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. But how? Maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think about possible splits.<br/><br/>The items are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes. So possible splits could be:<br/><br/>- I take the coin and one envelope, the other takes the other envelope and both potatoes. But wait, there are only 2 envelopes. So if I take one, the other can take the other. Similarly for potatoes. But the coin is only one. So if I take the coin, the other can&#x27;t. So maybe the coin is a point of contention.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe split the envelopes and potatoes. For example, I take both envelopes and one potato, the other takes the coin and the other potato. But that would require the other player to accept that. But since their values are unknown, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and one envelope. Then the other player would need to take the remaining envelope and both potatoes. But if their value for the coin is high, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose something that&#x27;s a fair split, or maybe take the most valuable items for me.<br/><br/>Wait, but my value function is all 2s. So each item is equally valuable to me. So maybe I should just take as many items as possible. But the other player&#x27;s values could be different. For example, if they value the coin more, they might want to take it. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best approach is to make a proposal that&#x27;s balanced, or maybe take the coin and some items, and see if the other player can accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is also all 2s. If that&#x27;s the case, then any split would be acceptable. But the problem states that each has a secret value function, so I can&#x27;t assume they are the same. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope]. Then the other player would need to take the remaining 1 envelope and 2 potatoes. If their value function allows that, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they value the coin more, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose taking the coin and one envelope, and hope the other player can take the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking both envelopes and one potato. Then the other player would need to take the coin and the other potato. Again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible, so that the other player can accept it. For example, if I take the coin and one envelope, and the other takes the other envelope and both potatoes. That uses all items. So that&#x27;s complementary. So if I make that proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is the remaining items, then it&#x27;s complementary.<br/><br/>But how do I know if the other player will accept? Since I can&#x27;t communicate except through messages or secret proposals. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me try that.<br/><br/>So my first move is to make a secret proposal. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope]. Then the other player would need to respond with a proposal that complements this. If they do, then we both get points. If not, we get zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking all items except one, but that might not be possible. Wait, the items are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes. So total of 5 items. If I take 3 items, the other can take 2. But the exact split depends on the items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the best is to propose taking the coin and one envelope. Then the other player can take the remaining envelope and both potatoes. That would be complementary. So if I make that proposal, and the other player&#x27;s proposal is the rest, then it works.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Since my value function is all 2s, I don&#x27;t care which items I get, as long as I get some. But the other player might have different values. For example, if they value the coin more, they might want to take it. But if I take the coin, they can&#x27;t. So maybe I should propose taking the coin and some items, but that might not be optimal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is also all 2s. If that&#x27;s the case, then any split is acceptable. But the problem says &quot;geheime Wertfunktion&quot;, so it&#x27;s secret. So I can&#x27;t assume.<br/><br/>In this case, since I don&#x27;t have information about the other player&#x27;s values, maybe the best strategy is to make a proposal that is as balanced as possible, or take the most items. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to make a proposal that allows both players to get as many items as possible. For example, if I take 2 items and the other takes 3, but that depends on the items.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes. So total 5 items. If I take 2 items, the other can take 3. But the exact items matter. For example, if I take the coin and one envelope, the other can take the other envelope and both potatoes. That&#x27;s 2 items for me and 3 for them. If their value function is such that they value the potatoes more, that&#x27;s good. But if they value the coin more, they might not accept.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope]. Then the other player would need to take the remaining 1 envelope and 2 potatoes. If their value function allows that, then it&#x27;s good. If not, we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and both envelopes. Then the other player would need to take the 2 potatoes. That&#x27;s 3 items for me and 2 for them. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. Let me go with [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope, 1 potato]. Then the other player would need to take the remaining 1 envelope and 1 potato. That&#x27;s 3 items for me and 2 for them. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the coin more. So if I take the coin, they might not accept. But if I don&#x27;t take the coin, they might take it. So maybe I should propose taking the coin and some items, but that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is the same as mine. If that&#x27;s the case, then any split is acceptable. But since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t assume. So perhaps the best is to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the potatoes more. So if I take the potatoes, they might not accept. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>This is tricky. Since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. Let me think of possible proposals.<br/><br/>Option 1: [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope, 1 potato]. Then the other player would need to take 1 envelope and 1 potato. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them. If their values are such that they can accept that, then it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Option 2: [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 envelopes]. Then the other player takes 2 potatoes. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them.<br/><br/>Option 3: [Proposal: 2 envelopes, 1 potato]. Then the other player takes 1 coin and 1 potato. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them.<br/><br/>Option 4: [Proposal: 1 envelope, 1 potato]. Then the other player takes 1 coin, 1 envelope, 1 potato. That&#x27;s 2 items for me, 3 for them.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I need to choose a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since all items are equally valuable to me, maybe I should take as many as possible. But the other player might have different values.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the coin more. So if I take the coin, they might not accept. But if I don&#x27;t take the coin, they might take it. So maybe I should propose taking the coin and some items, but that&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the envelopes more. So if I take the envelopes, they might not accept. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>In the absence of information, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as balanced as possible. For example, taking 2 items and leaving 3 for the other. But which items?<br/><br/>Alternatively, since the coin is unique, maybe the other player would want it. So if I don&#x27;t take the coin, they might. So maybe I should take the coin and some items. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is the same as mine. If that&#x27;s the case, then any split is acceptable. So I can propose any split, and they would accept. But since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t be sure.<br/><br/>Given that, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that takes the coin and one envelope. Then the other player can take the remaining envelope and both potatoes. If their value function allows that, then it&#x27;s good. If not, we get zero. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that takes the coin and both envelopes. Then the other player takes the two potatoes. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them. If their value function is such that they value the potatoes, that&#x27;s good. If they value the coin or envelopes more, they might not accept.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a proposal, I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope]. That way, the other player can take the remaining envelope and both potatoes. If their value function is such that they value the potatoes, then it&#x27;s a good split. If not, maybe they would prefer to take the coin, but since I already took it, they can&#x27;t. So this might be a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the coin and both envelopes. Then the other player takes the two potatoes. That&#x27;s 3 items for me, 2 for them. If their value function is such that they value the potatoes, that&#x27;s good. If they value the coin or envelopes more, they might not accept.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a risk.

So if I take the coin, they might not accept. But if I don&#x27;t take the coin, they might. So maybe I should not take the coin. But then they might take it. So it&#x27;s a dilemma.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the potatoes more. So if I take the potatoes, they might not accept. But again, I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>This is really challenging. Since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. Let me think of the possible outcomes.<br/><br/>If I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope], and the other player&#x27;s proposal is [Proposal: 1 envelope, 2 potatoes], then it&#x27;s complementary. So both get points. My score would be 2+2+2=6, theirs would be 2+2+2=6. Total 12. That&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 envelopes], and the other proposes [Proposal: 2 potatoes], then it&#x27;s complementary. My score 2+2+2=6, theirs 2+2=4. Total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 2 envelopes, 1 potato], and the other proposes [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 potato], then it&#x27;s complementary. My score 2+2+2=6, theirs 2+2=4. Total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 envelope, 1 potato], and the other proposes [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope, 1 potato], then it&#x27;s complementary. My score 2+2=4, theirs 2+2+2=6. Total 10.<br/><br/>So the best possible total is 12 if both get 3 items. But that requires that the other player&#x27;s proposal is the remaining items. So if I make a proposal that takes 3 items, and the other takes 2, but only if their values allow.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the safest is to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as balanced as possible. For example, taking 2 items and leaving 3.
