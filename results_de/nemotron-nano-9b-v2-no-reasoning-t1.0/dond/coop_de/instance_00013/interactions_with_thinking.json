                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 pen, 1 flower, and 3 frames. My secret value function is pen:4, flower:0, frame:2. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one pen and one flower, those can't be split. The frames are three, so maybe split them between us. But how?\n\nThe key is that both players need to make secret proposals that are complementary. That means the items in both proposals must not overlap and cover all items. Wait, no. The problem says \"complementary\" if there are enough items to satisfy both. So if I propose to take the pen and two frames, and the other player proposes the flower and one frame, then together they take all items. That would be complementary. But if both propose the pen, then it's not complementary because there's only one pen.\n\nSo the challenge is to propose items in a way that the other player's proposal complements mine. Since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. \n\nMy values: pen is worth 4, which is high. Frames are 2 each. The flower is 0, so I don't care about it. The other player might value the flower or frames differently. \n\nIf I propose taking the pen and two frames, that's 4 + 2*2 = 8 points for me. If the other player can take the flower and one frame, they might get some value. But if their value for the flower is high, maybe they would want it. Alternatively, if they value frames more, they might take more frames. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pen and one frame, leaving two frames and the flower. But then the other player could take the flower and two frames. But if they value the flower, that's good for them. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's attractive to them. Maybe offering the flower? But I don't value it. However, if the other player values the flower, they might accept a proposal that includes it. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the secret proposals are made by each player. So each player makes a proposal, and if they are complementary, both get their items. So I need to make a proposal that the other player would find complementary. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player can take the remaining items. For example, if I take the pen and two frames, the other player can take the flower and one frame. If they value the flower, that's good. If they value frames, maybe they can take one. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the pen and one frame, the other player can take the flower and two frames. But again, depends on their values. \n\nAnother approach: since the flower is worth 0 to me, maybe I should offer it to the other player. But I don't know if they value it. If they do, then they might accept a proposal that includes the flower. \n\nBut how to structure the secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. \n\nPossible options:\n\nOption 1: Propose pen and two frames. Then the other player can take flower and one frame. If they value the flower, they might accept. If they value frames, maybe they can take one. \n\nOption 2: Propose pen and one frame. Then the other player can take flower and two frames. \n\nOption 3: Propose pen and flower. But I don't value the flower, but maybe the other player does. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, it's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose only the pen. Then the other player can take the flower and three frames. But if they value the frames, that's good. \n\nBut the problem is that if the other player's proposal doesn't complement mine, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nSince I have high value for the pen, I should definitely take it. The frames are also valuable. The flower is not. \n\nSo maybe the best is to propose the pen and two frames. That way, the other player can take the flower and one frame. If they value the flower, they get some points. If they value frames, they get one. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the pen and one frame, the other player can take the flower and two frames. \n\nBut which is better? It depends on the other player's values. Since I don't know, maybe I should propose the pen and two frames, as that gives me more value. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. So if I take pen and two frames, the other player can take the remaining items: flower and one frame. That's complementary. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pen, 2 frames]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player might not want the flower. But since I don't know, this is the best I can do. \n\nAnother thought: if I propose the pen and one frame, and the other player proposes the flower and two frames, that's also complementary. But again, depends on their values. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the safest is to take the pen and as many frames as possible. \n\nSo I'll go with proposing the pen and two frames. That way, I get 4 + 2*2 = 8 points. The other player gets the flower (0 for me) and one frame (2 for them, if they value it). \n\nBut if the other player's value for the frame is higher, they might prefer that. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the pen and one frame, and the other player takes the flower and two frames. If they value the frames more, that's better for them. \n\nBut without knowing their values, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, maybe I should propose items that the other player would also value. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's value function is such that they value the flower highly. If that's the case, I should offer the flower to them. But since I don't know, maybe I should not include the flower in my proposal. \n\nSo, in conclusion, my best bet is to propose the pen and two frames. That way, I get the high-value items, and the other player can take the remaining items. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 pen, 2 frames].\n"
