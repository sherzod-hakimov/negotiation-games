                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 3 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork. My value function is scissors:3, glove:0, fork:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are 3 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork, the total items are 5. Each player can get some combination. But since the other player's values are unknown, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nMy value for scissors is high (3), so I want as many as possible. The glove is worthless to me, so maybe I can give that to the other player. The fork is worth 1, so maybe keep it or trade it depending on the other's value.\n\nBut since I don't know the other's values, I need to make a proposal that's attractive to them. Maybe offer the glove and fork, which might be valuable to them. Alternatively, offer some scissors. But if I offer too many scissors, maybe they don't want them. \n\nWait, the key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose something, the other player's proposal should cover the remaining items. For example, if I take 2 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork, then the other player would need to take 1 scissor. But if their value for scissors is low, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me. That way, the other player might be more willing to take the scissors. But I need to think about what's likely to be complementary. \n\nAnother approach: since I have high value for scissors, maybe I should take as many as possible. But if I take all 3 scissors, then the other player would need to take the glove and fork. If their value for those is high, that's good. But if not, maybe they would propose something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe split the scissors. For example, take 2 scissors, and give 1 to the other. But then the other might not want that. \n\nWait, the problem is that I don't know the other's values. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Maybe offer the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me. That way, the other player might be more inclined to accept, as they might value those items more. \n\nSo my first proposal could be: [Proposal: 0 glove, 1 fork]. That way, I'm giving up the glove (which I don't value) and the fork (which I value 1). If the other player values the glove or fork, they might accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 2 scissors. But then the other player would need to take 1 scissor, glove, and fork. If they value scissors, that's good. But if they don't, they might not. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the safest bet is to propose items that I don't value much. So the glove and fork. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to make sure I use that format. \n\nSo my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me think. If I propose taking the glove and fork, that's 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork. Then the other player would need to take 3 scissors. If their value for scissors is high, that's good. But if they don't, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 1 scissor and the fork. That way, I get 1 scissor (value 3) and 1 fork (1), total 4. The other player would get 2 scissors, 1 glove. If they value scissors, that's good. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's tricky. Maybe the best approach is to make a proposal that's balanced. For example, take 2 scissors and the fork. That gives me 2*3 +1=7. The other player would get 1 scissor and 1 glove. If they value scissors, that's 3, plus glove 0, total 3. So total sum would be 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 3 scissors, that's 9, and the other gets glove and fork. If they value those, maybe 0+1=1, total 10. \n\nBut if the other player's value for scissors is low, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the glove and fork. That way, I get 0+1=1, and the other gets 3 scissors. If they value scissors, that's 3*3=9. Total 10. \n\nBut if they don't value scissors, they might not. \n\nSince I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the items I don't value, so the other player can take them. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork]. That way, I'm giving up the items I don't care about, and the other player can take the scissors. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the proposal is in the correct format. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So for example, [Proposal: 0 glove, 1 fork]. \n\nWait, the numbers are the quantities. So if I want to take 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork, that's [Proposal: 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork]. \n\nBut maybe the other player would prefer to take the scissors. So if I propose that, they might accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 scissor and the fork. That way, I get 3+1=4, and the other gets 2 scissors and 1 glove. If they value scissors, that's 2*3=6, total 10. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. \n\nSince the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to propose items that are less valuable to me, so the other player can take them. So the glove and fork. \n\nSo my first secret proposal would be [Proposal: 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal complements this. If they take the 3 scissors, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if they propose something else, maybe not. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to make a strategic first move. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the other player's value for the glove is high. If I give them the glove, they might be happy. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the fork more. \n\nBut without information, it's hard. \n\nIn such cases, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value while leaving room for the other player to get something they value. \n\nSo, for example, if I take 2 scissors (value 6) and the fork (1), total 7. The other player would get 1 scissor and 1 glove. If they value scissors, that's 3, total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 1 scissor, 1 glove, 1 fork (value 3+0+1=4), and the other gets 2 scissors. If they value scissors, that's 6, total 10. \n\nBut if they don't value scissors, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the glove and fork (value 1), and the other takes 3 scissors (value 9), total 10. \n\nSo in that case, the sum is 10. \n\nBut if the other player's value for scissors is low, say 1 each, then 3 scissors would be 3, and my 1, total 4. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best is to propose the items I don't value, so the other can take them. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork]. \n\nBut I need to check the format. The numbers are the quantities. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork]. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 scissor and the fork. [Proposal: 1 scissors, 1 fork]. \n\nBut then the other player would need to take 2 scissors and 1 glove. \n\nIf they value scissors, that's good. \n\nBut again, without knowing, it's a risk. \n\nBut since my value for scissors is high, maybe I should take as many as possible. But if I take all 3, then the other player gets glove and fork. If they value those, that's good. \n\nBut if they don't, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's value for the glove is high. If I give them the glove, they might accept. \n\nBut again, I don't know. \n\nIn the absence of information, maybe the safest is to propose the items I don't value. So the glove and fork. \n\nSo my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 0 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork]. \n\nThat's my first move.\n"
