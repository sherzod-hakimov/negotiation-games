        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 2 Bells, 1 Doll, and 2 Ribbons. My value function is Bell:1, Doll:2, Ribbon:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>First, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are limited items, especially the Doll which is only one, that might be a key point. If both players want the Doll, there&#x27;s a conflict. But since we need complementary proposals, we have to split the items without overlap.<br/><br/>My strategy should be to propose items that I value highly, but also consider what the other player might value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should start by proposing items that are high in my value but maybe not too high for them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less likely to be contested.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to find a split where both can get items without overlapping. <br/><br/>Let me list all possible items and their quantities. Bells: 2, Doll:1, Ribbons:2. So total items are 5. Each player can take some, but the sum of their items must not exceed the available quantities.<br/><br/>Possible splits could be:<br/><br/>- One player takes the Doll, the other takes the rest. But since there are two Bells and two Ribbons, maybe split those. For example, Player A takes Doll and one Bell, Player B takes one Bell and two Ribbons. But need to check if that&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe split the Doll between them? No, because there&#x27;s only one. So one must take it. So the Doll is a critical item. If I propose taking the Doll, the other player might also propose taking it, leading to a conflict. So maybe I should avoid proposing the Doll unless I&#x27;m sure the other player doesn&#x27;t want it. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Another approach: since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe we should aim for a split where both get as much as possible. For example, if I take the Doll (value 2) and one Bell (1), total 3. The other player could take the other Bell (1) and two Ribbons (3 each, so 6). Total sum would be 3 + 7 = 10. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they value Ribbons less. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make assumptions.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take two Ribbons (3 each, total 6) and the Doll (2), that&#x27;s 8. The other player could take two Bells (1 each, total 2). Sum is 10. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high in my value but not too high for them. For example, if I propose the Doll and a Ribbon, maybe the other player can take the Bells and the other Ribbon. But I need to make sure that the proposals are complementary.<br/><br/>Wait, the key is that the proposals must be complementary. So if I propose [Doll, Ribbon], and the other player proposes [Bell, Bell, Ribbon], then the total items would be Doll (1), Ribbon (2), Bells (2). That&#x27;s all items. So that&#x27;s complementary. Then both get their items. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the Doll, then it&#x27;s conflicting.<br/><br/>So maybe I should start by proposing items that are high in my value but not overlapping. Let me think. My highest value is Ribbons (3 each). So maybe propose two Ribbons. But if the other player also wants Ribbons, that&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, propose the Doll and a Ribbon. But again, if they want the Doll, conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Bell. Then the other player could take the other Bell and two Ribbons. That would be complementary. But if the other player&#x27;s value for the Doll is higher, they might also propose it, leading to a conflict.<br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should start with a proposal that&#x27;s safe. For example, propose the Doll and a Ribbon. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want the Doll, they can take the Bells and the other Ribbon. If they do want the Doll, then we have a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose items that are less likely to be contested. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the two Bells. Since I value them at 1 each, but maybe the other player values them less. If I take both Bells, then the other player can take the Doll and two Ribbons. That would be complementary. But if the other player also wants Bells, then conflict. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and two Ribbons. That&#x27;s 2 + 3*2 = 8. Then the other player can take the two Bells (1 each, total 2). Sum is 10. But if the other player also wants the Doll or Ribbons, conflict.<br/><br/>Hmm. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best approach is to propose items that are high in my value and see if the other player can take the rest. But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high for me but not too high for them. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s values are secret. So maybe I should propose items that are high for me but not too high for them. For example, if I propose the Doll (which I value at 2) and a Ribbon (3), maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the Doll is lower, so they might not want it. But if they do, then conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the two Ribbons. Since they are high for me (3 each), and maybe the other player values them less. If I take both Ribbons, the other player can take the Doll and two Bells. That would be complementary. But if the other player also wants Ribbons, then conflict. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. Maybe start with a proposal. Let me think about the first message. <br/><br/>If I propose [Doll, Ribbon], then the other player might respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is complementary, we get points. Otherwise, zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Ribbon, Ribbon]. That&#x27;s two Ribbons. Then the other player could take the Doll and two Bells. That&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value for Ribbons is high, they might also propose them, leading to conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Doll, Bell]. Then the other player can take the other Bell and two Ribbons. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the Doll is unique, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose it first. If I take the Doll, then the other player can take the rest. But if they also want the Doll, then conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Ribbon. If the other player doesn&#x27;t want the Doll, they can take the Bells and the other Ribbon. <br/><br/>But I need to make a proposal. Let me decide on the first message. <br/><br/>I think the best approach is to propose items that are high in my value but not too high for the other player. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe propose the Doll and a Ribbon. If they accept, great. If not, maybe adjust. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the two Ribbons. That&#x27;s 3 each, so 6. Then the other player can take the Doll and two Bells. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the proposals are complementary. So if I propose [Ribbon, Ribbon], and the other player proposes [Doll, Bell, Bell], that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes Ribbons, then conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [Doll, Ribbon, Ribbon]. But that&#x27;s three items. Wait, the format is [Vorschlag: &lt;Nummer&gt; &lt;Objektname&gt;, ...]. So each item is listed with a number. But the numbers might refer to the quantity? Or is it just listing the items? The example given is &quot;[Vorschlag: &lt;Nummer&gt; &lt;Objektname&gt;, ...]&quot;. Maybe the number is the quantity? Or is it just an identifier? The problem statement isn&#x27;t clear. <br/><br/>Wait, the example in (c) says: &quot;Vorschlag: &lt;Nummer&gt; &lt;Objektname&gt;, &lt;Nummer&gt; &lt;Objektname&gt;, ...&quot;. So maybe the number is the quantity? Or is it just a label? For example, if I have two Bells, maybe I can propose &quot;1 Bell, 1 Bell&quot; but that&#x27;s redundant. Or maybe the number is the item&#x27;s identifier. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. <br/><br/>This is a bit ambiguous. But given the example, maybe the number is just a way to list the items. For example, if I have two Bells, I can propose &quot;1 Bell, 1 Bell&quot; but that&#x27;s not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the number is the quantity. So &quot;2 Bells&quot; would be &quot;2 Bell&quot;. <br/><br/>But the exact format isn&#x27;t clear. However, the key is that the proposal must list the items you want. So if I want two Bells, I can write &quot;2 Bell&quot;. <br/><br/>Assuming that, then my first proposal could be &quot;2 Ribbon&quot; (since they are high value for me). Then the other player might propose something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose &quot;Doll, Ribbon&quot;, that&#x27;s two items. <br/><br/>But I need to make a proposal. Let me go with proposing the Doll and a Ribbon. So the first message would be: [Vorschlag: 1 Doll, 1 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>But wait, the format is &quot;Vorschlag: &lt;Nummer&gt; &lt;Objektname&gt;, ...&quot;. So maybe the number is the quantity. So &quot;1 Doll, 1 Ribbon&quot;. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the number is just a label, but that&#x27;s unclear. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the number is the item&#x27;s identifier. But since the items are Bells, Doll, Ribbons, maybe the numbers are 1, 2, 3. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. <br/><br/>This is a bit confusing. But given the example, I think the number is just part of the proposal format. So for example, if I want to propose a Bell and a Ribbon, I would write &quot;1 Bell, 1 Ribbon&quot;. <br/><br/>But since there are two Bells and two Ribbons, maybe I can propose &quot;2 Bell&quot; or &quot;2 Ribbon&quot;. <br/><br/>So, considering that, maybe my first proposal is to take the Doll and a Ribbon. So [Vorschlag: 1 Doll, 1 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then we both get our items. If not, zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose two Ribbons, that&#x27;s [Vorschlag: 2 Ribbon]. Then the other player could take the Doll and two Bells. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Another angle: since the sum of both players&#x27; scores is to be maximized, maybe we should aim for a split where both get as much as possible. For example, if I take the Doll (2) and two Ribbons (3 each, total 6), that&#x27;s 8. The other player takes two Bells (1 each, total 2). Sum is 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value for the Doll is higher, they might also want it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the two Bells (1 each, total 2) and the Doll (2), total 4. The other player takes two Ribbons (3 each, total 6). Sum is 10. <br/><br/>But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose items that are high for me and see. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and two Ribbons. That&#x27;s 2 + 3*2 = 8. Then the other player can take the two Bells. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the Doll or Ribbons, conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the two Bells and the Doll. That&#x27;s 1*2 + 2 = 4. The other player takes two Ribbons (6). Sum 10. <br/><br/>But again, if the other player wants the Doll, conflict. <br/><br/>Since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be strategic. Maybe start with a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Another thought: since the Doll is unique, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose it first. If I take the Doll, then the other player can take the rest. But if they also want it, conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the two Ribbons. Since they are high for me, and maybe the other player values them less. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. Let me go with proposing the Doll and a Ribbon. So the first message is [Vorschlag: 1 Doll, 1 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>If the other player responds with a complementary proposal, great. If not, maybe adjust. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the two Ribbons. [Vorschlag: 2 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>But I think the Doll is a key item. If I can get it, that&#x27;s 2 points. So maybe prioritize that. <br/><br/>So my first proposal would be [Vorschlag: 1 Doll, 1 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>Then, depending on the other player&#x27;s response, I can adjust. <br/><br/>But since I have to send messages, and each message is a proposal or a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that each player can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. So the first message could be a secret proposal. <br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to send my first message. <br/><br/>Given that, I should make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>So the first message should be a secret proposal. <br/><br/>What should I propose? <br/><br/>If I propose the Doll and a Ribbon, that&#x27;s two items. The other player might propose something else. <br/><br/>Alternatively, propose two Ribbons. <br/><br/>But since I value Ribbons higher, maybe that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>So [Vorschlag: 2 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>Then the other player might propose something else. <br/><br/>If they propose, say, the Doll and a Bell, then we can check if it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>If I have 2 Ribbons, and they have Doll and Bell, then total items are 2 Ribbons, 1 Doll, 1 Bell. But there are 2 Bells and 2 Ribbons. So that&#x27;s not all items. So the proposals are not complementary. <br/><br/>Wait, the total items are 2 Bells, 1 Doll, 2 Ribbons. So if I take 2 Ribbons, and the other player takes 1 Doll and 1 Bell, then there&#x27;s still 1 Bell left. So the proposals are not complementary. <br/><br/>So that would result in zero points. <br/><br/>Therefore, the proposals need to cover all items. <br/><br/>So for example, if I propose [Doll, Ribbon], and the other player proposes [Bell, Bell, Ribbon], then together they have Doll, Ribbon, Bell, Bell, Ribbon. That&#x27;s all items. So that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>So in that case, both get their items. <br/><br/>So my proposal should be such that the other player can take the remaining items. <br/><br/>So if I propose [Doll, Ribbon], the other player can take [Bell, Bell, Ribbon]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Ribbon, Ribbon], the other player can take [Doll, Bell, Bell]. <br/><br/>Either way, that&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>So which proposal is better for me? <br/><br/>If I take 2 Ribbons (3 each, total 6) and the other player takes Doll (2) and two Bells (1 each, total 2). Sum is 6 + 4 = 10. <br/><br/>If I take Doll (2) and Ribbon (3), total 5. The other player takes two Bells (2) and one Ribbon (3). Sum is 5 + 5 = 10. <br/><br/>So both scenarios give the same total. <br/><br/>But depending on the other player&#x27;s values, maybe they value the Doll more. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose the two Ribbons. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Ribbon. <br/><br/>But I need to choose. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and two Bells. That&#x27;s 2 + 1*2 = 4. The other player can take two Ribbons (6). Sum 10. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>So regardless of the split, the maximum possible sum is 10. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they value the Doll more. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose items that are high for me. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with proposing the two Ribbons. <br/><br/>So the first message is [Vorschlag: 2 Ribbon]. <br/><br/>Then, if the other player responds with a complementary proposal, we get points. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they propose something else, maybe I can adjust. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe start with a proposal that includes the Doll. <br/><br/>But I think the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll proceed with proposing the two Ribbons. <br/><br/>So the first message is: [Vorschlag: 2 Ribbon]<br/></p>
