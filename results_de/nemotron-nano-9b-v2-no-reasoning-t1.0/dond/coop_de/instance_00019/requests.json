Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Haken, 1 Blume, 1 Karte, 1 Radiergummi, 1 Schwamm\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nHaken: 3, Blume: 3, Karte: 0, Radiergummi: 1, Schwamm: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format.

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, and 1 sponge. My secret values are: hooks are worth 3 each, flower 3, card 0, eraser 1, sponge 0. The other player's values are unknown, but we need to maximize the total sum of both our scores. \n\nFirst, I should figure out what items are valuable to me. Hooks and flowers are both worth 3 each. The eraser is 1, and the others are 0. So I want to get as many hooks and flowers as possible. But since there are only 2 hooks and 1 flower, I need to decide how to split them. \n\nThe other player's values are secret, so I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value different items. For example, maybe they value the card or sponge more. But since I don't know, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nThe key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), then both get points. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or that we can split without conflict. \n\nLet me think about possible proposals. Since I have two hooks, maybe I can take both. But if the other player also wants hooks, that would conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can take one hook and the flower, leaving the other hook for them. But again, if they want hooks, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the flower and the eraser. The flower is valuable to me, and the eraser is worth 1. The other player might not want the flower, but maybe they do. \n\nWait, the problem says that the other player has their own secret value function. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since I don't know their values, I have to make a guess. \n\nAnother approach: since the goal is to maximize the total sum, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me and not to the other player. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose items that are not valuable to me but might be to them. But that might not be optimal. \n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, both get their points. So if I propose items that the other player doesn't want, and they propose items that I don't want, then it's complementary. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nLet me think about possible items. The items are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, 1 sponge. \n\nIf I propose to take both hooks and the flower, that's 3 items. The other player would need to propose the remaining items: card, eraser, sponge. If their proposal includes those, then it's complementary. But if they also want hooks or flower, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose to take the flower and the eraser, and the other player proposes the hooks, card, sponge. That would be complementary. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAnother thought: since the total value for me is 3+3+1=7 (if I get both hooks, flower, and eraser). But if the other player gets nothing, the total is 7. If we can split items so that both get some value, the total could be higher. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best is to propose items that I value highly and hope they don't want them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. But again, without info, it's a guess. \n\nWait, the problem says that the other player's value function is secret. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. \n\nMaybe I should propose the items I value most, and hope the other player doesn't want them. For example, if I take both hooks and the flower, and the other player takes the rest. If they don't want hooks or flower, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser, and the other player takes the hooks, card, sponge. \n\nBut I need to make a specific proposal. Let me think about the possible combinations. \n\nAnother angle: the total number of items is 6. Each player can take some. The key is to have non-overlapping items. \n\nIf I propose to take the flower and the eraser, that's two items. The other player would need to take the rest: 2 hooks, card, sponge. If their proposal includes those, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I take one hook, the flower, and the eraser, that's three items. The other player would need to take the other hook, card, sponge. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the card. Since the card is worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values it. But that might not be optimal. \n\nWait, the goal is to maximize the total sum. So if I can get items that I value and the other player also gets items they value, the total would be higher. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and are not likely to be wanted by the other player. For example, if I take both hooks and the flower, and the other player takes the rest. If they don't want hooks or flower, then it's good. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser, and the other player takes the hooks, card, sponge. \n\nBut I need to make a specific proposal. Let me try to draft a proposal. \n\nFor example: [Proposal: 1 Hook, 1 Flower, 1 Eraser]. \n\nIf the other player's proposal is [Proposal: 1 Hook, 1 Card, 1 Sponge], then it's complementary. But if they also want hooks or flower, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Since I don't have information about the other player's values, I have to make an educated guess. \n\nAnother thought: since the other player's values are secret, maybe the best is to propose items that are not valuable to me but might be to them. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the items I value most, and hope the other player doesn't want them. \n\nSo, for example, I could propose to take both hooks and the flower. That's 3 items. The other player would need to take the remaining: card, eraser, sponge. If their proposal includes those, then it's complementary. \n\nBut if they also want hooks or flower, then it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. That's two items. The other player would need to take the rest. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the card. Since the card is worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values it. \n\nBut this is all speculative. \n\nGiven the constraints, I think the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and are not likely to be wanted by the other player. Since I don't know their values, I'll have to make a proposal that's as valuable to me as possible, hoping that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. \n\nSo, I'll propose to take both hooks and the flower. That's 3 items. The other player would need to take the remaining: card, eraser, sponge. \n\nIf their proposal is complementary, then I get 3+3=6 points, and they get whatever they value from card, eraser, sponge. \n\nAlternatively, if they also want hooks or flower, then it's not complementary. \n\nBut since I can't know, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. That's two items. The other player would take the rest. \n\nBut again, it's a gamble. \n\nAnother consideration: the other player might have a value function that values the card or sponge. For example, if they value the card highly, then taking it would be good. \n\nBut without knowing, I can't be sure. \n\nIn conclusion, I'll make a proposal that includes the items I value most, hoping that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. So my proposal would be: [Proposal: 2 Hooks, 1 Flower]. \n\nThis way, I get the maximum value for myself, and if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we both get zero. \n\nBut I need to check if this is the best possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the flower and the eraser. That's two items. The other player would take the rest. \n\nBut again, it's a guess. \n\nI think the first proposal is better because it maximizes my own value. Even if the other player's proposal conflicts, it's a risk, but it's the best I can do with the information I have.\n",
