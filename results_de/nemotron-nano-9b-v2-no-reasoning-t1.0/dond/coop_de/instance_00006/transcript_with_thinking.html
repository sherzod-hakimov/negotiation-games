        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 1 potato, 1 glove, 2 rulers, 1 pipe, and 2 cards. My secret value function is: potato 0, glove 1, ruler 3, pipe 1, card 1. <br/><br/>First, I should understand what the other player&#x27;s value function might be. Since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t know for sure, but maybe I can make some assumptions. The key is to find a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, covers all items without overlap. If their proposal is complementary, both get points based on their own values. Otherwise, both get zero.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. The best approach might be to make a secret proposal that covers items I value highly, hoping the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. But I need to consider possible overlaps.<br/><br/>Looking at my values: rulers are the most valuable (3 each), then gloves and pipes and cards (1 each), and potatoes are worthless. So I should prioritize getting the rulers. There are two rulers, so if I can get both, that&#x27;s 6 points. But if the other player also wants them, we might have a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the rulers and some other items. Let me think. If I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2], that&#x27;s 6 points for me. But the other player might also propose rulers. If they do, then we can&#x27;t both get them, so both get zero. That&#x27;s bad. So maybe I should propose a combination that includes rulers but also other items that the other player might not value as much.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly and that are unique or have limited quantity. For example, the glove is only one, so if I take it, the other player can&#x27;t. Similarly, the pipe and cards are single or two. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that covers as much as possible, but in a way that the other player&#x27;s proposal can complement. For example, if I take the rulers and the glove, and the other player takes the pipe and cards, that would cover all items. But I need to make sure that their proposal is complementary.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is as comprehensive as possible, but also leaves room for the other player to add their own items. However, if I take too much, they might not have enough to complement.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Another angle: the total value of all items. Let&#x27;s calculate. Potato 0, glove 1, two rulers 3 each (total 6), pipe 1, two cards 1 each (total 2). Total is 0+1+6+1+2=10. If both players can get all items, the total would be 10. But since each player&#x27;s score is based on their own values, the maximum possible sum would be 10. But if there&#x27;s overlap, the sum could be less.<br/><br/>So the goal is to have a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, covers all items. So I need to propose a set that, when combined with the other&#x27;s set, includes all items. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a guess.<br/><br/>Maybe I should propose the items I value most, and hope the other player&#x27;s proposal covers the rest. For example, if I take the two rulers (6 points), and maybe the glove (1), then the other player could take the pipe and cards (1+2=3). That would cover all items. But if the other player also wants the rulers, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the rulers and the pipe, and the other player proposes the glove and cards, that would work. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>Since I can only make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. Let me think about possible combinations. The key is to maximize my own score while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal can complement it.<br/><br/>If I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove], that&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. Then the other player would need to take the pipe and two cards. If they do, then both get their points. But if they also want rulers, it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Pipe, Card 1], that&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. Then the other player would need to take the glove and card 2. That would cover all items. But again, if they also want rulers, it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose the items I value most, which are the rulers. So [Ruler 1, Ruler 2]. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the remaining items (glove, pipe, cards), then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they also propose rulers, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a mix. For example, [Ruler 1, Glove, Pipe]. That&#x27;s 3+1+1=5. Then the other player could take the other ruler and two cards. That would cover all items. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the best possible one. Given that rulers are the most valuable, I should prioritize them. So my secret proposal would be [Ruler 1, Ruler 2]. That gives me 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the remaining items (glove, pipe, cards), then both get their points. If not, then zero.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should include some other items to make it more likely that the other player&#x27;s proposal can complement. For example, [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove]. Then the other player needs to take pipe and cards. If they do, then I get 7, they get 1+1+1=3 (assuming their values for glove, pipe, cards are 1 each). But if their values are different, it could vary.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe the other player also values rulers highly. In that case, my proposal of two rulers might conflict. But if they don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a combination that includes some items that are less likely to be contested. For example, the glove is only one, so if I take it, the other player can&#x27;t. Similarly, the pipe is one. So maybe [Glove, Pipe, Card 1]. That&#x27;s 1+1+1=3. Then the other player could take the two rulers and card 2. That would cover all items. But if they also want the glove or pipe, it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. However, since my goal is to maximize the sum, I need to find a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Another thought: the total number of items is 1+1+2+1+2=7. Each player&#x27;s proposal must cover all 7 items when combined. So each proposal must be a subset of the items, and their union must be all items. So my proposal and the other&#x27;s must be disjoint and cover all items.<br/><br/>Therefore, my secret proposal should be a subset of the items, and the other&#x27;s proposal should be the complement. So I need to choose a subset that I value highly, and hope the other player&#x27;s proposal is the complement.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a guess. The best way is to propose items that I value the most, and that are unique or have limited quantity. <br/><br/>So, for example, if I take the two rulers (6 points), and maybe the glove (1), then the other player would need to take the pipe and two cards. If they do, then I get 7, they get 1+1+1=3 (if their values are 1 for each). The total would be 10, which is maximum. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the two rulers and the pipe, that&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. The other player would need to take the glove and two cards. Again, if they do, total is 7 + (1+1+1)=10.<br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the rulers, then it&#x27;s a conflict. So the risk is that if they also propose rulers, we both get zero. But if I can get the rulers, it&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a mix of high and low value items. For example, [Ruler 1, Glove, Card 1]. That&#x27;s 3+1+1=5. Then the other player would need to take ruler 2, pipe, card 2. If they do, then I get 5, they get 3+1+1=5. Total 10. That&#x27;s good. But if they also want the ruler, then conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safer approach. However, the problem is that I don&#x27;t know their values. If they value the glove more, then taking it might be better for them. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the two rulers and the two cards. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. Then the other player would need to take the glove and pipe. If they do, then I get 8, they get 1+1=2. Total 10. That&#x27;s good. But again, if they also want the rulers or cards, conflict.<br/><br/>But since the cards are two, maybe the other player might want both. But if I take both, then they can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the two rulers and the pipe. That&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. The other player would need to take the glove and two cards. If they do, then I get 7, they get 1+1+1=3. Total 10. <br/><br/>This seems like a good strategy. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is the complement. Since I can&#x27;t know, but the goal is to maximize the sum, I should propose items that are high value for me and that the other player might not want. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s value function is different. For example, if they value the potato highly, but I don&#x27;t. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to assume that they might value similar items. <br/><br/>In any case, the best approach is to propose the items I value most, which are the rulers. So my secret proposal would be [Ruler 1, Ruler 2]. That gives me 6 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the remaining items (glove, pipe, cards), then both get their points. If not, zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove], that&#x27;s 7. The other player would need to take pipe and cards. If they do, then I get 7, they get 1+1+1=3. Total 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the glove, then conflict. <br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know, but the goal is to maximize the sum, I should go for the highest possible value for myself, assuming that the other player&#x27;s proposal can complement. <br/><br/>Therefore, my secret proposal would be [Ruler 1, Ruler 2]. That&#x27;s the best I can do given my value function.<br/></p>
