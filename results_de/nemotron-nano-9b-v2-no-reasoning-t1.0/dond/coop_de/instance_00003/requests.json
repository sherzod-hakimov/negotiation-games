Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Karotte, 4 Taschen, 1 Zwiebel\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nKarotte: 3, Tasche: 1, Zwiebel: 3\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein.

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 pockets, and 1 onion. My secret value function is carrot:3, pocket:1, onion:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one carrot and one onion, those are unique items. The pockets are four, so they can be split. The key is to find a complementary proposal where both get items without overlapping. \n\nIf I make a secret proposal, I need to list items in brackets. For example, if I propose [1 carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player should propose the remaining items: [1 onion, 2 pockets]. That would be complementary. But I don't know the other player's values. Maybe they value onions more than carrots, or vice versa. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, onion], then the other player would need to take all 4 pockets. But if they value pockets highly, that could work. However, if they don't value pockets much, they might not accept. \n\nWait, but since the other player's values are secret, I have to make assumptions. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly and see if the other player can complement. For instance, if I take the carrot and onion, which are high value for me (3 each), totaling 6. Then the other player would need to take all 4 pockets. If they value pockets at 1 each, that's 4. Total sum would be 10. But if they value pockets more, say 2 each, then 8, total 14. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 pockets and the carrot, then the other player could take the onion and 2 pockets. My value would be 3+2=5, theirs 3+2=5, total 10. But again, depends on their values. \n\nBut since I can't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and hope the other player can complement. Alternatively, maybe propose a split that maximizes possible total value. \n\nAnother angle: the maximum possible total value if all items are allocated. Carrot (3) + onion (3) + 4 pockets (4*1=4) = 10. If both players can get all items, that's the max. But since each proposal must be complementary, maybe the best is to split the high-value items. \n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal, I need to decide what to propose. Let me think of possible proposals. \n\nOption 1: Propose [carrot, onion]. Then the other player needs to take 4 pockets. If they accept, my score is 3+3=6, theirs 4*1=4. Total 10. \n\nOption 2: Propose [carrot, 2 pockets]. Then other player needs [onion, 2 pockets]. My score 3+2=5, theirs 3+2=5. Total 10. \n\nOption 3: Propose [onion, 2 pockets]. Similar to option 2. \n\nOption 4: Propose [4 pockets]. Then other player needs [carrot, onion]. My score 4*1=4, theirs 3+3=6. Total 10. \n\nSo in all these cases, the total is 10. But maybe there's a way to get higher? Wait, the total possible is 10. So any complementary proposal would reach that. \n\nBut if the other player's values are different, maybe they would prefer different items. For example, if they value onions more than carrots, then taking the onion would be better for them. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the safest is to propose items that I value highly. So carrot and onion. But if the other player also values those, they might not accept. Alternatively, maybe split the pockets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 1 pocket] and the other player takes [onion, 3 pockets]. My value 3+1=4, theirs 3+3=6. Total 10. \n\nBut again, same total. \n\nSo regardless of the proposal, as long as it's complementary, the total is 10. But the problem is that if the other player's proposal doesn't match, we both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value for me and see. Alternatively, maybe propose a split that covers all items. \n\nWait, the items are 1 carrot, 4 pockets, 1 onion. So any proposal must include some of these. \n\nIf I propose [carrot, onion], then the other player must take 4 pockets. If they accept, that's good. If not, we get zero. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player can take [onion, 2 pockets]. That's complementary. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the carrot and onion, since they are high value for me. Let me try that. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [carrot, onion]. Then the other player would need to take 4 pockets. If they accept, we both get points. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player can take [onion, 2 pockets]. \n\nBut which is better? It depends on their values. If they value onions more than pockets, then taking the onion would be better for them. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose the highest value items for me. So carrot and onion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player might not want to take all 4 pockets. If they value pockets less, they might prefer to take the carrot or onion. \n\nBut since I can't know, I have to make a guess. \n\nAnother thought: the maximum possible sum is 10. So any complementary proposal would achieve that. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept. \n\nIf I propose [carrot, onion], the other player might accept if they value pockets enough. If they value pockets at 1 each, 4 pockets is 4, which is less than 6 (my 3+3). But if they value pockets higher, say 2 each, then 8, which is better. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player can take [onion, 2 pockets]. If they value onions at 3 and pockets at 1, their total is 3+2=5. My total is 3+2=5. Total 10. \n\nBut if they value onions more, say 5, then their total would be 5+2=7, mine 3+2=5, total 12. But I don't know. \n\nThis is tricky. Since I can't know their values, maybe the best is to propose a split that covers all items, ensuring that both can get something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 1 pocket] and [onion, 3 pockets]. But again, same total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [4 pockets] and let the other player take the carrot and onion. \n\nBut I need to make a secret proposal. So I have to choose one. \n\nGiven that, maybe the best is to propose [carrot, onion] because those are high value for me. If the other player can take the 4 pockets, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player can take [onion, 2 pockets]. \n\nBut which is better? It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's values are such that they would prefer the carrot or onion. \n\nBut without information, I have to make a choice. \n\nAnother angle: the problem says that the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get less, if the other player gets more, the total could be higher. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best is to propose items that I value highly, and hope the other player can complement. \n\nSo I'll go with proposing [carrot, onion]. That way, if the other player can take the 4 pockets, we both get high scores. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player can take [onion, 2 pockets]. \n\nBut which is better? It's a 50-50 guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's values are such that they would prefer the carrot or onion. \n\nBut since I can't know, I'll have to make a decision. \n\nI think I'll propose [carrot, onion] as my secret proposal. That way, if the other player can take the 4 pockets, we both get high scores. \n\nSo the secret proposal would be: [Proposal: carrot, onion]\n",
