            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on a division of items. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, and 1 eraser. My secret value function is bowl:5, bottle:5, fruit:0, eraser:0. So I really want the bowl and bottle, and the fruits and eraser don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. But since I can't see theirs, I have to make assumptions or try to find a mutually beneficial split. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), we both get the sum of our values for the items we get. Otherwise, we both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or vice versa.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I should start by trying to communicate my preferences. But since messages are public, I need to be careful not to reveal too much. However, the secret proposal is the only way to commit to a specific allocation without the other player knowing my exact values.\n\nWait, but the secret proposal is made by each player, and if they are complementary, we both get points. So maybe the best strategy is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value (bowl and bottle) and see if the other player's proposal doesn't include those. But since I don't know their values, I have to guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose items that I don't care about (fruits and eraser) to see if the other player might want them. But since my value for those is zero, even if I get them, it doesn't help me. But if the other player values them, they might take them, leaving me with the bowl and bottle. But I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't overlap.\n\nBut since I can't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I want (bowl and bottle) in a secret proposal. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then we both get points. But if they do, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe I can propose the fruits and eraser, which I don't care about, and hope the other player takes them, leaving me with the bowl and bottle. But again, without knowing their values, it's risky.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the secret proposal is made by each player. So if I make a secret proposal, the other player might also make one. If both are complementary, we get points. Otherwise, zero. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the items I want, and hope the other player's proposal doesn't include them. But since I don't know their values, maybe they might also want the bowl and bottle. If that's the case, then our proposals would overlap, and we both get zero. That's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose items that I don't care about, like fruits and eraser, and hope the other player takes them. But again, if they don't value those, they might not take them, leading to a conflict. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the public messages to signal my preferences. For example, I can say something like \"I really want the bowl and bottle, so maybe you should take the fruits and eraser.\" But since messages are public, the other player can see that. But if I do that, maybe they would adjust their proposal accordingly. However, since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nBut the problem is that the secret proposal is the only way to commit. So maybe the best strategy is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and then in public messages, try to convince the other player to take the other items. But since I can't know their values, it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the bowl and bottle, and then in public messages, I can say that I'm willing to take the fruits and eraser if they take the bowl and bottle. But again, without knowing their values, it's uncertain.\n\nWait, but the other player's secret values are unknown. So maybe the optimal strategy is to propose the items I want in a secret proposal, and then in public messages, I can try to negotiate. For example, I can say \"I need the bowl and bottle, so if you take the fruits and eraser, I'll give you those.\" But since the other player might not value those, they might not agree. Alternatively, maybe they value the fruits or eraser, so I can offer them.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Since my value for fruits and eraser is zero, I can offer them to the other player if they want. But if they don't, then maybe they would take the bowl and bottle, which would conflict with my secret proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the fruits and eraser, and then in public messages, I can say that I'm willing to take the bowl and bottle if they take the fruits and eraser. But again, without knowing their values, it's a risk.\n\nThis is tricky. Since I can only make a secret proposal once, and the other player can do the same, I need to find a way to maximize my expected value. Since I value bowl and bottle highly, I should try to get them. But if the other player also wants them, we both get zero. So maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle in my secret proposal, and then in public messages, I can try to convince the other player to take the other items. But if they don't, then we both get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the fruits and eraser in my secret proposal, and then in public messages, I can say that I'm willing to take the bowl and bottle if they take the fruits and eraser. But again, if they don't value those, they might not agree.\n\nWait, but the secret proposal is a commitment. So if I make a secret proposal with bowl and bottle, and the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then we both get points. If their proposal includes those, then we both get zero. So the risk is that if the other player also values bowl and bottle, then our proposals would conflict. But since I don't know their values, I have to assume that they might or might not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a secret proposal that includes the fruits and eraser, which I don't care about, and then in public messages, I can say that I'm willing to take the bowl and bottle if they take the fruits and eraser. But again, if they don't value those, they might not take them, leading to a conflict.\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Since I can't know the other player's values, I have to make a decision based on my own. Since I value bowl and bottle, I should try to get them. But to do that, I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include them. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the fruits and eraser, and then in public messages, I can try to get the other player to take the bowl and bottle. But if they don't, then I might have to take the fruits and eraser, which I don't care about. But that's better than getting nothing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the bowl and bottle, and then in public messages, I can say that I'm willing to take the fruits and eraser if they take the bowl and bottle. But again, if they don't value those, they might not agree.\n\nWait, but the secret proposal is a one-time thing. So if I make a secret proposal with bowl and bottle, and the other player's proposal is complementary, then we both get points. If not, zero. So the key is to make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player's proposal.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I want (bowl and bottle) in a secret proposal, and then in public messages, I can try to negotiate. For example, I can say \"I really want the bowl and bottle, so if you take the fruits and eraser, I'll give you those.\" But if the other player doesn't value those, they might not take them, leading to a conflict.

But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAnother angle: since the other player's values are secret, maybe they have different priorities. For example, maybe they value the fruits or eraser. If I can find out through public messages, I can adjust my proposal. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nBut the problem is that the user is me, and I need to simulate the process. So I need to decide what to do first. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to send messages or make a secret proposal. Since I can make a secret proposal, maybe I should start with that. Let me consider making a secret proposal. If I propose the bowl and bottle, then the other player's proposal must not include those. If they do, we both get zero. If they don't, then I get 5+5=10 points, and they get whatever they value from their proposal.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose the fruits and eraser, then the other player's proposal must not include those. If they do, zero. If not, I get 0, and they get their value from their proposal.\n\nBut since I value bowl and bottle, I should try to get them. So maybe the best is to make a secret proposal with bowl and bottle. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include them. However, if the other player also values them, they might propose them, leading to a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the fruits and eraser in my secret proposal, and then in public messages, I can try to get the other player to take the bowl and bottle. But again, if they don't value those, they might not take them.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal with the items I want. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. Then, in public messages, I can try to convince the other player to take the fruits and eraser. But I need to send messages. However, the user hasn't provided the other player's responses yet. Wait, the user is me, and I need to simulate the process. So I need to decide what to do first.\n\nWait, the user is me, and I need to play the game. So I need to start by sending messages or making a secret proposal. Since I can make a secret proposal, maybe I should do that first. Let me make a secret proposal with the items I value. So I would write: [Proposal: 1 bowl, 1 bottle]. Then, the other player would make their own secret proposal. If their proposal doesn't include bowl or bottle, then we both get points. If it does, we both get zero.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, it's a risk. However, if I don't make a secret proposal, I might not get the items I want. Alternatively, maybe I can use public messages to signal my preferences. For example, I can say \"I really want the bowl and bottle, so if you take the fruits and eraser, I'll give you those.\" But the other player might not value those, so they might not agree. Alternatively, they might value the fruits or eraser, so I can offer them.\n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be strategic. Maybe I should first make a secret proposal, then use messages to negotiate. But the problem is that the other player might also make a secret proposal. So if I make a secret proposal, and they do too, then we check if they are complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not make a secret proposal and instead use public messages to negotiate. For example, I can say \"I want the bowl and bottle, so if you take the fruits and eraser, I'll give you those.\" But again, without knowing their values, it's uncertain.\n\nBut since the secret proposal is a way to commit, maybe it's better to make a secret proposal. Let me proceed with that. So my first action is to make a secret proposal with bowl and bottle. Then, depending on the other player's response, I can adjust. But since I can't see their response, I have to assume that they might or might not have conflicting proposals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the fruits and eraser, and then in public messages, I can try to get the other player to take the bowl and bottle. But again, if they don't value those, they might not take them.\n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. But given that I value bowl and bottle highly, I should try to get them. So I'll make a secret proposal with bowl and bottle. Let me write that.\n",
