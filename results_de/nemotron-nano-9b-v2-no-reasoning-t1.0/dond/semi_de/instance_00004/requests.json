Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Orange, 1 Paprika, 3 Bilder\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nOrange: 5, Paprika: 2, Bild: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 1 Orange, 1 Paprika, and 3 Pictures. My secret value function is Orange:5, Paprika:2, Picture:1. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by making a secret proposal that complements the other player's.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are valuable to me. The Orange is worth 5, which is the highest. Then Paprika is 2, and Pictures are 1 each. Since there are 3 Pictures, maybe splitting them could be beneficial. But since each Picture is only worth 1, maybe it's better to take as many as possible if possible.\n\nBut I need to make a secret proposal. The other player will also make one. For the proposals to be complementary, the total items in both must not exceed the available quantities. So, for example, if I take the Orange and Paprika, the other player can take the 3 Pictures. That would work because there's exactly 1 Orange, 1 Paprika, and 3 Pictures. So that's a possible complementary split.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the Orange and some Pictures, but then the other player might need the Paprika. But since the Paprika is only 1, if I take it, the other can't. So maybe the best approach is to take the Orange and Paprika, leaving the Pictures for the other. That way, I get 5+2=7 points, and they get 3*1=3. Total 10, which is good.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player's proposal can complement it. Since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I should probably go straight to a secret proposal. The other player might do the same. So I need to think of a proposal that maximizes my value while allowing the other to have some items.\n\nAnother possibility: if I take the Orange and 2 Pictures, that's 5+2=7. Then the other player could take the Paprika and 1 Picture. But that would require the other player to have a proposal that includes Paprika and 1 Picture. If they do that, then it's complementary. But if they don't, then we both get zero. So maybe that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, taking the Orange and Paprika is safer because the other player can take all 3 Pictures. Since Pictures are low value, but maybe the other player values them more. But since I don't know their value function, I have to assume they might value them less. But since I can't know, I should focus on maximizing my own value.\n\nSo the best proposal for me is to take the Orange and Paprika. That gives me 7 points. The other player can take the 3 Pictures. If they do that, we both get points. If they don't, then we both get zero. But since I can't control their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the Orange and 1 Picture. Then the other player could take the Paprika and 2 Pictures. That would also be complementary. But my value would be 5+1=6, which is less than 7. So that's worse.\n\nSo the best option is to propose taking the Orange and Paprika. That way, I get the highest possible value. The other player can take the Pictures. If they do, we both get points. If they don't, we both get zero. But since I can't know their proposal, I have to make the best possible offer.\n\nTherefore, my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 Orange, 1 Paprika]. That's the best I can do.\n",
