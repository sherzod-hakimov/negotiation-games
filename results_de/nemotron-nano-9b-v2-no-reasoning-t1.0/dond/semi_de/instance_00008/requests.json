Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n3 Schaufeln, 2 Bilder, 1 Muschel\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nSchaufel: 0, Bild: 0, Muschel: 10\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on how to split the items. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My secret value function is shovel: 0, picture: 0, shell: 10. So the shell is super valuable to me, but the other items don't matter. \n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I don't know. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. If I want to maximize my score, I need to get the shell. But if the other player also wants the shell, we might have a conflict. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, ensuring that our combined proposals don't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I value the shell at 10, I should definitely try to get it. But if I propose taking the shell, the other player might also propose taking it, leading to a conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items that the other player might not care about. But since my other items have zero value, maybe I should focus on the shell.\n\nWait, but if I propose taking the shell, and the other player also proposes taking it, then we can't both have it. So that would result in zero points. So maybe I need to propose something else. But if I don't take the shell, I get zero. So the risk is high. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items that the other player might not want. But since I don't know their values, it's tricky. Maybe the other player values the shovels or pictures. If I can get the shell and maybe some other items, but if the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, then we can both get points. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the safest way is to propose taking the shell. But if the other player also wants it, we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items, but if the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell, then we can both get it. \n\nWait, but the other player's proposal is also secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe I should propose taking the shell and some other items that are less valuable to me. But since I don't know their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and nothing else. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell, then we can both get it. But if they do, then we can't. \n\nBut since I have to make a proposal, I need to decide. Let me think about possible scenarios. \n\nIf I propose [Shell], and the other player proposes [Shell], then we both get zero. If they propose something else, like [Shovel], then we can both get the shell. But if they propose [Shell, Shovel], then we can't both have the shell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the shell and some other items that the other player might not want. For example, if I propose [Shell, Shovel], and the other player proposes [Shovel, Picture], then we can both get the shell and the shovel and picture. But since I don't know their values, this is risky. \n\nBut since my value for shovels and pictures is zero, maybe I should just focus on the shell. So my best bet is to propose taking the shell. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items, but if the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, then we can both get the shell. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be strategic. Maybe start by proposing the shell. Let me try that. \n\nSo my first message would be a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Shell]. Then, depending on the other player's response, I can adjust. But since I can't see their response, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the shell and some other items that are less likely to be wanted by the other player. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAnother thought: since the shell is the only item with value for me, I need to get it. If I can't get it, I get zero. So I should prioritize getting the shell. \n\nBut how to ensure that? Maybe by making a proposal that includes the shell and some other items that the other player might not want. For example, if I propose [Shell, Shovel], and the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell, then we can both get the shell. \n\nBut if the other player also wants the shell, then we can't. So maybe I should propose the shell and something else that's not valuable to me, but maybe the other player might not want. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and nothing else. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell, then we can both get it. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the shell.

If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shell, then we can both get the shell and the shovel. But if they do, then we can't. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe it's better to just propose the shell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and the other items that are not valuable to me. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. \n\nAnother angle: since the other player's value function is secret, maybe they also value the shell. If that's the case, then we need to find a way to split the items so that both get the shell. But that's impossible because there's only one shell. So if both propose the shell, we get zero. \n\nTherefore, the only way to get the shell is if the other player doesn't propose it. So I need to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, which might not include the shell. \n\nBut how? Maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items that the other player might not want. For example, if I propose [Shell, Picture], and the other player's proposal is [Shovel, Picture], then we can both get the shell and the picture. But if the other player's proposal includes the shell, then we can't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and nothing else.

If they do, we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items that are less likely to be wanted. \n\nBut since I can't know, I'll proceed with the shell. \n\nSo my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Shell].\n",
