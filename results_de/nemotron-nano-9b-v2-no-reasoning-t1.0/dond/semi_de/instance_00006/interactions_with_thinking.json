                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My secret values are apple:1, soap:3, egg:4. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to get a high score by making a proposal that complements the other's, so both get points.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The egg is worth 4, which is the highest. Then soap at 3, and apples at 1 each. So I probably want to get the egg and maybe the soap. But I need to think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions or try to find a balance.\n\nIf I propose taking the egg and the soap, that's two items. The other player would need to take the three apples. But if their value for apples is low, maybe they would accept. Alternatively, if they value the egg highly, they might not accept my proposal. But since I can't know, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the items in a way that both get something valuable. For example, if I take the egg and one apple, and the other takes the soap and two apples. But I need to check if that's possible. The total items are 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So if I take egg and one apple, that's 2 items. The other would need to take soap and two apples. That's 3 items. That works. But would that be a good split?\n\nBut I don't know the other's values. If they value soap highly, then taking soap and two apples might be good for them. If they value eggs more, they might not accept. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose something that's a good deal for me and possibly acceptable to them.\n\nAnother approach: since the egg is the most valuable to me, I should try to get it. So my proposal could be [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. That way, I get the two most valuable items. The other player would need to take the three apples. If their value for apples is low, they might accept. But if they value apples more, maybe not. But since I don't know, this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 Egg, 2 Apples]. Then the other would need to take the soap. If they value soap highly, that's good. But if they don't, they might not accept. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, both get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's, covers all items. So if I propose taking the egg and soap, the other would need to take the three apples. If that's possible, then both get points. But if the other's proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that's more balanced. For example, [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Apple]. Then the other would need to take 2 apples and the soap. That's 3 items. That could work. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. Maybe start with a proposal. Let me think about what's the best possible outcome for me. If I can get the egg and soap, that's 4+3=7 points. If I can't, maybe get the egg and some apples. But if the other player's proposal is not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's values are such that they would prefer the soap and eggs. But I don't know. Since I can't know, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother thought: the soap is only one, so if I take it, the other can't. Similarly for the egg. So maybe I should prioritize the egg first. Let me propose [Proposal: 1 Egg]. Then the other player would need to take the soap and three apples. If they value the soap and apples, that's good. But if they value the egg more, they might not accept. But since I can't know, this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. That's two items. The other would need to take three apples. If they value apples, that's okay. But if they value the soap or egg more, they might not. But again, without knowing, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the items in a way that both get something. For example, [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Apple]. Then the other would need to take 2 apples and the soap. That's three items. If the other values the soap and apples, that's good. But if they value the egg more, they might not.\n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should make a proposal first. Let me go with [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. That's my best bet to get the highest value items. If the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But it's worth trying.\n"
