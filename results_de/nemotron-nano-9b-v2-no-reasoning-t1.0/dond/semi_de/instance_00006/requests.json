Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n3 Äpfel, 1 Seife, 1 Ei\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nApfel: 1, Seife: 3, Ei: 4\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to get a high score by making a proposal that complements the other's, so both get points.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The egg is worth 4, which is the highest. Then soap at 3, and apples at 1 each. So I probably want to get the egg and maybe the soap. But I need to think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions or try to find a balance.\n\nIf I propose taking the egg and the soap, that's two items. The other player would need to take the three apples. But if their value for apples is low, maybe they would accept. Alternatively, if they value the egg highly, they might not accept my proposal. But since I can't know, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the items in a way that both get something valuable. For example, if I take the egg and one apple, and the other takes the soap and two apples. But I need to check if that's possible. The total items are 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So if I take egg and one apple, that's 2 items. The other would need to take soap and two apples. That's 3 items. That works. But would that be a good split?\n\nBut I don't know the other's values. If they value soap highly, then taking soap and two apples might be good for them. If they value eggs more, they might not accept. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose something that's a good deal for me and possibly acceptable to them.\n\nAnother approach: since the egg is the most valuable to me, I should try to get it. So my proposal could be [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. That way, I get the two most valuable items. The other player would need to take the three apples. If their value for apples is low, they might accept. But if they value apples more, maybe not. But since I don't know, this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 Egg, 2 Apples]. Then the other would need to take the soap. If they value soap highly, that's good. But if they don't, they might not accept. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, both get points. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's, covers all items. So if I propose taking the egg and soap, the other would need to take the three apples. If that's possible, then both get points. But if the other's proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that's more balanced. For example, [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Apple]. Then the other would need to take 2 apples and the soap. That's 3 items. That could work. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. Maybe start with a proposal. Let me think about what's the best possible outcome for me. If I can get the egg and soap, that's 4+3=7 points. If I can't, maybe get the egg and some apples. But if the other player's proposal is not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's values are such that they would prefer the soap and eggs. But I don't know. Since I can't know, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother thought: the soap is only one, so if I take it, the other can't. Similarly for the egg. So maybe I should prioritize the egg first. Let me propose [Proposal: 1 Egg]. Then the other player would need to take the soap and three apples. If they value the soap and apples, that's good. But if they value the egg more, they might not accept. But since I can't know, this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. That's two items. The other would need to take three apples. If they value apples, that's okay. But if they value the soap or egg more, they might not.

That's my best bet to get the highest value items. If the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But it's worth trying.\n",
