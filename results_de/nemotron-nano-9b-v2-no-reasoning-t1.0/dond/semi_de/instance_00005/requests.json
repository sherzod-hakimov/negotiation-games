Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Würfel, 1 Ball, 1 Klebstoff, 1 Batterie\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nWürfel: 1, Ball: 7, Klebstoff: 0, Batterie: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. The items are 2 dice, 1 ball, 1 glue, and 1 battery. My secret values are: dice 1 each, ball 7, glue 0, battery 1. So the ball is super valuable to me, and the dice are not so much. The other player's values are unknown, but I need to make a proposal that maximizes my score.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The ball is worth 7, which is way higher than the others. So I should definitely try to get the ball. The battery is worth 1, same as each die. Glue is worthless to me. \n\nThe other player might value different items. For example, maybe they value the dice more, or the battery. But since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. The key is to propose items that I value highly and hope the other player doesn't need them as much. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So I need to make a proposal that includes items I want, and avoid items that the other player might also want. \n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, but each message can be a proposal or a regular message. But the secret proposal is in the specific format. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the instructions say that if I make a secret proposal, it's in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide whether to make a secret proposal now or send regular messages first. \n\nBut the problem is that I don't know the other player's values. So maybe I should first send some messages to get information. However, the rules say that messages are sent directly, so I can't ask questions. So maybe I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose items that I value highly and leave the rest to the other player. For example, if I take the ball and the battery, and leave the dice and glue. But the other player might also want the battery. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the ball and the battery, and the other player might propose the dice and glue. But if they also want the battery, then it's not complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the ball and the dice, but since the dice are low value for me, that might not be good. \n\nWait, the key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that the other player's proposal doesn't overlap. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. \n\nLet me think about possible scenarios. \n\nIf I take the ball (which is worth 7 to me), and maybe the battery (1), and leave the dice and glue. If the other player takes the dice and glue, then it's complementary. But if they also want the battery, then it's not. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the ball and the glue (but glue is worthless to me), that's not good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the battery. Then, if the other player proposes the dice and glue, that's complementary. But if they propose the ball, then it's not. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the ball and the battery, as those are the items I value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the dice. But the dice are only worth 1 each. \n\nWait, but the other player might value the dice more. For example, if they have a secret function where dice are worth more. \n\nBut without knowing, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the ball and the battery. Let me check the format. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. \n\nSo my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Ball, 1 Battery]. \n\nBut then the other player might also propose the ball. If they do, then it's not complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the glue. But glue is worthless to me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the dice. But again, the dice are low value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and leave the rest. But the other player might take the battery. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. \n\nAnother approach: since the ball is my highest value item, I need to get it. So I should propose the ball. Then, for the other items, maybe I can take the battery, which is also valuable to me. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Ball, 1 Battery]. \n\nIf the other player's proposal doesn't include the ball or battery, then it's complementary. \n\nBut if they also want the ball or battery, then it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the glue. But glue is worthless. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the dice. But again, the dice are low. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the ball and the battery, and hope the other player doesn't want those. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a regular message first to get some information. But the rules say that messages are sent directly, so I can't ask questions. \n\nWait, the rules say that messages are sent directly, so I can't ask the other player questions. So I have to make a proposal based on my own values. \n\nSo the best I can do is to propose the items I value most. \n\nSo the ball is 7, battery is 1. So I should propose the ball and the battery. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Ball, 1 Battery]. \n\nThen, if the other player's proposal doesn't include those, we both get points. \n\nAlternatively, if they propose the ball, then it's not complementary. \n\nBut since I can't know, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the ball. But then the other player might take the battery. \n\nBut if I take the ball and the battery, that's better for me. \n\nSo I think the best move is to make a secret proposal with the ball and the battery. \n\nSo the answer would be the secret proposal in the required format.\n",
