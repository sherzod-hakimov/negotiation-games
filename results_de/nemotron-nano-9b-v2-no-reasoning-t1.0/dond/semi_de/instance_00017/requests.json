Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Teller, 1 Münze, 2 Süßigkeiten, 2 Zitronen\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nTeller: 0, Münze: 2, Süßigkeit: 4, Zitrone: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

My secret value function is plates: 0, coin: 2, candy: 4, lemon: 0. So, I value candies the most, then coins, and plates and lemons are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, so I have to assume they might value different items. Since I can't know their preferences, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain while trying to get a complementary proposal from them. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we each want don't overlap), we both get points based on our own valuations. Otherwise, we both get zero. So, my goal is to propose items that I value highly (candies and maybe the coin) and hope the other player proposes items they value that don't conflict with mine.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think about what to propose. I should take as many candies as possible because they're worth 4 each. There are 2 candies, so I can take both. Then, maybe take the coin since it's worth 2. That would be [Proposal: 2 Candies, 1 Coin]. \n\nBut wait, the coin is only one. If I take the coin, the other player can't take it. But if they value the coin more, they might want it. However, since I don't know their values, maybe it's better to take the coin and both candies. Alternatively, maybe leave the coin for them if they value it more. But since I don't know, taking it might be better for me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose just the candies. If I take both candies, that's 8 points for me. If the other player proposes items they value, like maybe plates or lemons, which I don't care about, then our proposals could be complementary. For example, if they propose plates and lemons, which I don't value, then we can both get our items. \n\nBut if I take the coin as well, that's 2 more points. However, if the other player also wants the coin, then our proposals would conflict, and we both get zero. So there's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose only the candies. That way, if the other player proposes something else, like the coin and plates, then we can both get our items. \n\nBut how to structure the secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me check the items again: 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. \n\nIf I propose 2 candies, that's 2 items. The other player might propose the coin and maybe plates or lemons. If they propose the coin, then we can both get our items. If they don't, maybe they propose something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 candies and 1 coin. But if they also want the coin, that's a conflict. \n\nSince I can't know their preferences, maybe the safest bet is to propose the candies. That way, even if they take the coin, I still get the candies. But if they take the candies, then I get nothing. \n\nWait, but the secret proposal is my own. So I need to decide what to propose. Let me think again. My value function is candies (4 each), coin (2), plates and lemons 0. So I should prioritize candies. \n\nSo my secret proposal should be to take both candies. That's 2 candies. Then, if the other player proposes items they value, like maybe the coin, plates, or lemons, then we can have complementary proposals. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the coin as well, but that might be risky. \n\nSo the best approach is to make a secret proposal for 2 candies. That's my highest value items. Then, in the messages, I can try to communicate that I want the candies, and maybe ask them to take the coin or other items. But since messages are public, I need to be careful not to reveal too much. \n\nBut the first step is to make a secret proposal. So I should send [Proposal: 2 Candies]. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include candies, we can both get our items. If they also want candies, then we conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 candies and 1 coin. But again, the coin is a risk. \n\nI think the best is to propose 2 candies. Let me go with that.\n",
