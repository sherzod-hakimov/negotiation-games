Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n4 Magnete, 1 Schaufel, 1 Blume\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nMagnet: 0, Schaufel: 2, Blume: 8\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

So the flower is super valuable to me, the shovel is moderately valuable, and magnets don't matter at all.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. But I need to make a secret proposal. The goal is to get as high a score as possible. Since the flower is worth 8 to me, I should definitely try to get that. The shovel is worth 2, so maybe I can get that too. The magnets are worthless to me, so maybe I can give them to the other player if it helps.\n\nBut I need to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think. If I propose to take the flower and the shovel, that would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]. But I need to check if that's possible. The other player might have a different proposal. But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to decide what to offer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the flower, since it's the most valuable. But if the other player also wants the flower, then we can't both get it. But if I propose the flower and the shovel, maybe the other player would accept if they can get the magnets. But I don't know their values. \n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items to satisfy both, then both get their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, doesn't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the best possible one.\n\nGiven that the flower is worth 8 to me, I should definitely include that. The shovel is worth 2, so maybe include that too. The magnets are worthless, so maybe I can offer them to the other player. But in my proposal, I can only list what I want. So if I propose [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel], then the other player might propose something else. If their proposal is, say, 4 magnets and 1 flower, then we can't both get the flower. But if their proposal is 4 magnets and 1 shovel, then we can both get our items. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose just the flower, then the other player might take the shovel and magnets. But if they take the flower, then I get nothing. But if I take the flower and shovel, and they take the magnets, that would be good. \n\nBut since I can't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. Since the flower is the most valuable, I should prioritize that. So my secret proposal should be to take the flower and the shovel. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, I get both. If they do conflict, maybe I can still get the flower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the flower, to avoid giving away the shovel. But if the other player also wants the flower, then we can't both get it. But if I take the flower and shovel, and they take the magnets, that's better. \n\nSo I think the best move is to propose [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]. That way, I get the two most valuable items. The magnets can be given to the other player, but since they are worthless to me, it's okay. \n\nWait, but the other player might have a different value for the shovel. If they value the shovel more than me, they might want it. But since I don't know their values, I have to assume that my proposal is the best possible. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel].\n",
