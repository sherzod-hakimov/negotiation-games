Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n4 Papiere, 2 Uhren, 2 Kartoffeln\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nPapier: 1, Uhr: 1, Kartoffel: 2\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My secret value function is 1 for paper, 1 for clock, and 2 for potato. The goal is to get a high score by making a secret proposal that complements the other player's. \n\nFirst, I should think about what items are valuable to me. Potatoes are worth 2 each, so I really want those. Clocks are 1 each, and papers are 1 each. Since there are 2 potatoes, maybe I should aim to get both. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine. \n\nIf I propose to take both potatoes, then the other player might also want them. But if I can get both, that's 4 points. Then, maybe I can take some papers or clocks. But I need to check if the other player's proposal allows that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose something that leaves enough for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock, that's 2*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 7 points. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't take those items. \n\nWait, but the other player's value function is unknown. They might value different items. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe I should focus on the items I value most. \n\nSince potatoes are the highest value, I should definitely try to get both. Then, maybe take some papers or clocks. But I need to leave enough for the other player. Let me think about the total items. There are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. \n\nIf I take both potatoes, that's 2. Then, maybe take 2 papers and 1 clock. That would leave 2 papers and 1 clock for the other player. If the other player's value function is similar, they might take the remaining items. But if their value function is different, maybe they prefer clocks or papers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That's 2*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 7. If the other player's proposal is complementary, they might take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock. But if they take those, their score would be 2*1 + 1*1 = 3. So total score would be 7 + 3 = 10. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. If I propose that, and they propose something else, maybe they take the potatoes. But if I can get both potatoes, that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 2 clocks and 2 papers. But if they take 2 clocks, that's 2*1 = 2, and 2 papers is 2*1 = 2. So total 4. So my score would be 6, theirs 4. Total 10. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. What if I take 2 potatoes, 1 clock, and 2 papers. That's 2*2 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 7. Then the other player could take 1 clock and 2 papers. Their score would be 1*1 + 2*1 = 3. Total 10 again. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 potatoes and 2 clocks. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 4 papers. Their score would be 4*1 = 4. Total 10. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value function is different. For example, if they value clocks more, they might take the clocks. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nAnother approach: since there are 2 potatoes, maybe I should propose taking both. Then, the other player might also want them. But if I can get both, that's good. Then, for the remaining items, maybe take as much as possible. \n\nSo my secret proposal could be: [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. That uses 2 potatoes, 2 papers, 1 clock. The remaining items would be 2 papers and 1 clock. If the other player's proposal is to take those, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 clocks. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 4 papers. Their score would be 4. Total 10. \n\nBut maybe the other player's value function is such that they prefer papers. If they take 4 papers, that's 4 points. If I take 2 potatoes and 2 clocks, that's 6. So total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 potatoes and 1 clock, that's 2*2 + 1*1 = 5. Then the other player could take 2 clocks and 2 papers. Their score would be 2*1 + 2*1 = 4. Total 9. That's worse. \n\nSo the best is to take 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That gives me 7, and the other player can take 2 papers and 1 clock, which is 3. Total 10. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. If I propose that, and they propose something else, maybe they take the potatoes. But if I can get both, that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 papers.

So my score is 6, theirs 4. \n\nBut if the other player's value function is different, maybe they prefer clocks. For example, if they value clocks more, they might take the 2 clocks. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nAnother thought: since there are 2 potatoes, and I value them highly, I should definitely propose to take both. Then, for the remaining items, I can take as much as possible. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. That uses 2 potatoes, 2 papers, 1 clock. The remaining items are 2 papers and 1 clock. If the other player's proposal is to take those, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose 2 Potatoes, 1 Clock, and 2 Papers, that's the same as above. \n\nI think that's a solid proposal. It maximizes my value by taking the high-value potatoes and as many papers as possible. The clocks are less valuable, but taking one might be okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take 2 potatoes and 2 clocks. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 4 papers. Their score is 4. Total 10. \n\nBut if the other player's value function is such that they value papers more, they might take the papers. But if they value clocks more, they might take the clocks. \n\nSince I don't know, maybe the safest is to take the potatoes and as many papers as possible. \n\nSo I'll go with the proposal: [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. That should give me a good score if the other player's proposal is complementary.\n",
