                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 1 lamp, 3 gloves, and 1 rope. My secret value function is lamp=3, gloves=2 each, rope=1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to get a high score by making a secret proposal that complements the other's, so both get points.\n\nFirst, I should consider possible proposals. Since there's only one lamp and one rope, those are unique items. The gloves are three, so maybe splitting them. But since the other player's values are unknown, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nIf I propose taking the lamp and maybe some gloves, and leave the rope and remaining gloves for the other. But I need to think about what's valuable. My lamp is worth 3, which is the highest. So maybe I should take the lamp. The rope is only worth 1, so maybe the other player might want that. But if I take the lamp and some gloves, and the other takes the rope and the rest, maybe that's a good split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the lamp and all gloves, but that would leave the rope for the other. But if the other player values the rope highly, they might not accept. But since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach: since gloves are three, maybe split them. For example, take 2 gloves and leave 1. But if the other player values gloves more, they might want more. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nThe key is to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since the lamp is the most valuable to me, I should definitely take it. The rope is less valuable to me, so maybe offer it to the other. But if the other player's value for the rope is high, they might take it. But since I can't know, maybe propose taking the lamp and some gloves, and leave the rope and remaining gloves.\n\nWait, the secret proposal format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think of possible combinations.\n\nOption 1: Take the lamp and 2 gloves. Then the other would get 1 glove and the rope. If their value for the rope is high, they might accept. But if they value gloves more, maybe not. But since I don't know, this is a risk.\n\nOption 2: Take the lamp and all 3 gloves. Then the other gets the rope. If they value the rope, they might accept. But if they don't, they might reject. But since the lamp is worth 3 to me, and gloves 2 each, taking all gloves would give me 3 + 3*2 = 9 points. The other would get 1 (rope). If their value for the rope is, say, 1, then they get 1. But if their value is higher, maybe they would accept. But if they value gloves more, they might not. But since I can't know, this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the lamp and the rope. Then the other gets 3 gloves. If they value gloves, they might accept. But if they value the rope more, they might not. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAnother thought: since the other player's values are secret, maybe the best strategy is to propose items that are high value to me and low to them. But since I don't know their values, this is impossible. So maybe the safest is to take the lamp and some gloves, and leave the rope. But how to structure the proposal.\n\nWait, the secret proposal is a list of items I want. So if I propose [Proposal: 1 lamp, 2 gloves], then the other would need to propose the remaining items (1 glove and 1 rope) for it to be complementary. If their proposal includes those, then both get points. But if their proposal doesn't, then both get zero.\n\nSo I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complemented by the other's proposal. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and not too high to them. But again, without knowing, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the lamp and the rope. If the other player's value for the rope is low, they might accept. But if it's high, they might not. But since I don't know, this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, take the lamp and 1 glove. Then the other would need to take 2 gloves and the rope. If they value gloves, they might accept. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the lamp and all gloves. Then the other would have to take the rope. If they value the rope, they might accept. But if they don't, they might not. But since the lamp is worth 3 to me, and gloves 2 each, this would give me 3 + 3*2 = 9 points. The other would get 1 (rope). If their value for the rope is 1, then they get 1. But if their value is higher, say 2, they might not accept. But since I can't know, this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the lamp and 1 glove. Then the other would need to take 2 gloves and the rope. If they value gloves, they might accept. But again, not sure.\n\nSince the problem is to make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. Given that the lamp is the highest value to me, I should definitely take it. The rope is the least valuable to me, so maybe offer it to the other. But if the other player's value for the rope is high, they might take it. But since I can't know, maybe the best is to take the lamp and some gloves, and leave the rope. Let me go with taking the lamp and 2 gloves. So the proposal would be [Proposal: 1 lamp, 2 gloves]. That way, the other would need to take 1 glove and 1 rope. If their values for those are acceptable, they might accept. If not, they might reject. But this is a possible strategy.\n"
