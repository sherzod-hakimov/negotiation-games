Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Rahmen, 1 Schuh, 3 Hämmer\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nRahmen: 8, Schuh: 2, Hammer: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 1 frame, 1 shoe, and 3 hammers. My secret value function is frame: 8, shoe: 2, hammer: 0. So the frame is super valuable to me, the shoe is a bit, and hammers don't matter. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's complementary to theirs.\n\nFirst, I should think about what items are important to me. The frame is worth 8, so I really want that. The shoe is 2, so maybe I can take that if possible. Hammers are worthless to me, so I can give those away. But I need to make sure that my proposal and the other player's proposal don't overlap. Since there's only one frame and one shoe, if both want them, we can't both get them. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or maybe split the hammers.\n\nWait, the hammers are 3. Since they're worthless to me, maybe I can offer all the hammers to the other player. But I need to check if that's a good idea. If the other player values hammers, then they might take them. But since I don't care, maybe that's a way to get the frame and shoe for myself. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the frame and shoe, and give the hammers to the other player. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, I have to make an educated guess. If I propose taking the frame and shoe, and give the hammers, maybe the other player would accept if they don't want the frame or shoe. But if they do want them, then we can't both get them. So maybe I should propose the frame and shoe, and see if the other player is willing to take the hammers. Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the frame, and let the other player take the shoe and hammers. But since the shoe is worth 2 to me, maybe I should take that as well.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if I propose the frame and shoe, and the other player also proposes the frame and shoe, then we can't both get them. So I need to make a proposal that's complementary. Maybe I should propose the frame and the hammers, and the other player can take the shoe. But since hammers are worthless to me, that's okay. But if the other player values hammers, they might take them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and the other player can take the hammers. But again, if they want the shoe, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the frame, and let the other player take the shoe and hammers. That way, I get the frame (8 points) and the other player gets the shoe (2) and hammers (0 for me). But if the other player's value for the shoe is higher, they might take it. But since I don't know, maybe that's a safe bet. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and the other player can take the hammers. But again, if they want the shoe, that's a conflict.\n\nWait, the key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose [Frame, Shoe], and the other player proposes [Hammer, Hammer, Hammer], then that's complementary because there's enough items. But if the other player's proposal includes the frame or shoe, then it's not complementary. So my goal is to propose items that the other player is less likely to want. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and hope that the other player doesn't want them. But that's risky. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the hammers, and the other player can take the shoe. But again, if they want the shoe, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and the other player can take the hammers. If the other player's value for the shoe is low, then they might accept. But if they value the shoe highly, they might not. Since I don't know, maybe I should make a proposal that's as good as possible for me, and hope the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. So my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me think about the format. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Since I want the frame (8) and the shoe (2), I should propose those. So my first message would be [Proposal: 1 Frame, 1 Shoe]. Then, if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But if I propose that, and the other player also proposes the frame and shoe, then we can't both get them. So maybe I should propose just the frame, and let the other player take the shoe and hammers. That way, I get the frame (8) and the other player gets the shoe (2) and hammers (0 for me). But if the other player's value for the shoe is higher, they might take it. But since I don't know, maybe that's the best I can do. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the hammers, and the other player can take the shoe. But again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and the other player can take the hammers. If the other player's value for the shoe is low, then they might accept. But if they value it, they might not. Since I can't know, maybe I should go with the frame and shoe. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is made by each player, and if they are complementary, both get points. So if I propose [Frame, Shoe], and the other player proposes [Hammer, Hammer, Hammer], then it's complementary. But if the other player proposes [Frame, Shoe], then it's not. So my goal is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I don't know the other player's values, maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be wanted by them. But since I don't know, maybe the best is to propose the frame and shoe, and hope the other player doesn't want them. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the hammers, and the other player can take the shoe. But again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and the other player can take the hammers. If the other player's value for the shoe is 0, then they would take the hammers. But if their value for the shoe is higher, they might not. But since I don't know, maybe that's the best I can do. So I'll go with proposing the frame and shoe. Let me write that as the secret proposal.\n",
