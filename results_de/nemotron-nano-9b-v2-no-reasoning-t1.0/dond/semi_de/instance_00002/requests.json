Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Schaufel, 2 Beeren, 1 Schüssel, 3 Gläser\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nSchaufel: 6, Beere: 0, Schüssel: 1, Glas: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on a division of items. Both players have secret valuations, and I need to communicate via messages, but only up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal.\n\nFirst, I should understand the items and their quantities. The available items are 1 shovel, 2 berries, 1 bowl, and 3 glasses. My valuations are: shovel is 6, berries 0, bowl 1, glasses 1 each. So the shovel is super valuable to me, but berries don't matter. The bowl and glasses are each worth 1.\n\nThe other player's valuations are unknown, which complicates things. Since I can't know their preferences, I need to make assumptions or try to find a mutually beneficial split.\n\nThe key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we each want don't overlap), we both get the sum of our valuations. Otherwise, we get nothing. So the challenge is to propose items in a way that covers all items without overlapping, but since we don't know each other's valuations, it's tricky.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. But what should I propose? Let's think.\n\nMy high-value item is the shovel. If I can get the shovel, that's 6 points. The other items (bowl and glasses) are worth 1 each. Berries are worthless to me. So maybe I should propose taking the shovel, and maybe some other items. But I need to consider that the other player might also want the shovel. If they do, then if we both propose the shovel, it's a conflict, and we get nothing. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or that I can get without conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose items that I value and that the other player might not. For example, if I propose the shovel and the bowl, but if the other player doesn't want the bowl, maybe they can take the berries or glasses. But since I don't know their valuations, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value and that are unique. The shovel is unique (only 1), so if I take it, the other player can't. But if they also want it, then we can't both have it. So maybe I should propose the shovel and some other items that I value, but not the ones that are more likely to be desired by the other player.\n\nWait, but since I don't know their valuations, maybe I should propose items that I value and that are not too valuable to them. For example, if I propose the shovel and the bowl, but if the other player values the bowl more, they might take it, leading to a conflict. Alternatively, if I propose the shovel and the glasses, but again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value and that are not in high demand. Since I don't know, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl, and see if the other player can take the berries and glasses. But if they want the bowl, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the shovel and some other items. Let me think about the possible combinations.\n\nIf I propose the shovel, then the other player can't take it. But if they also propose the shovel, then we both get nothing. So maybe I should propose the shovel and some other items that I value, but not the ones that are likely to be desired by the other player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value and that are not unique. For example, the berries are 2, but I don't value them. The glasses are 3, but I value them at 1 each. If I propose the shovel and the glasses, maybe the other player can take the berries and the bowl. But again, without knowing their valuations, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the shovel and the bowl. If the other player's proposal doesn't include the shovel or the bowl, then we can both get them. But if they do, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the berries. But since berries are worthless to me, that's not helpful. Wait, but maybe the other player values berries. If I propose the shovel and berries, and they propose something else, maybe we can split. But since I don't know, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl. If the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then I get 6+1=7. If they do, then we get nothing. But if they don't, then I get 7. But if they do, then 0. So it's a 50-50 chance? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the glasses. Since there are 3 glasses, maybe the other player can take some. But again, without knowing their valuations, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the shovel and the bowl. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If the other player's proposal is complementary, then we both get our items. If not, we get nothing. So the key is to find a proposal that is likely to be complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know their valuations, maybe I should propose items that I value and that are not too valuable to them. For example, if I propose the shovel and the bowl, and the other player's proposal is, say, the berries and glasses, then it's complementary. But if they propose the shovel, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the berries. But since I don't value berries, that's not good. Wait, but maybe the other player values berries. If I propose the shovel and berries, and they propose something else, then I get 6 (shovel) + 0 (berries) = 6. But if they also propose the shovel, then we get nothing. So it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the shovel and the bowl.

But again, without knowing their valuations, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the shovel and the bowl. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Shovel, 1 Bowl]. Then, if the other player's proposal doesn't include these, we both get them. If they do, then we get nothing. But since I don't know their valuations, this is a risk. However, since the shovel is my highest value item, I need to get it.
