        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. The items are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 nails, and 2 cups. My secret value function is: wire is 1, glass 0, nail 0, cup 4. So I really want the cups, and the wires are somewhat valuable, but the others don&#x27;t matter to me.<br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s value function isn&#x27;t given, so I have to assume they might value different items. Since I can&#x27;t know their preferences, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own score while considering possible overlaps. The key is to get as many cups as possible because they&#x27;re worth 4 each. There are two cups, so if I can get both, that&#x27;s 8 points. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict with mine.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., all items are covered without overlap), we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So I need to propose items in a way that leaves enough for the other player to also get some items, but since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should focus on getting the cups and maybe some wires.<br/><br/>Wait, but if I take both cups, the other player might not have any cups. But if their value function values cups highly, they might not accept my proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose one cup and some wires, leaving the other cup for them. But if they value cups more, they might take both. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and some wires. Let&#x27;s think. If I propose both cups and both wires, then the other player would need to propose the remaining items: 2 glasses and 2 nails. If their value function values those, then we could have a complementary proposal. But if their value function doesn&#x27;t care about glasses or nails, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose one cup and one wire. Then the other player could take the other cup and the remaining wire, plus maybe some other items. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem is that I need to make a secret proposal. The other player will also make a secret proposal. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player&#x27;s proposal.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are valuable to me and leave items that might be valuable to them. For example, if I take the cups, which are high value for me, and maybe some wires. Then the other player might take the remaining items. But if they value glasses or nails, they might take those. However, if they don&#x27;t value those, they might not accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and both wires. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the glasses and nails, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they don&#x27;t value those, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose one cup and one wire. Then the other player could take the other cup and the remaining wire, plus maybe some other items. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, the key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complementary with the other player&#x27;s proposal. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are not too overlapping. For example, if I take both cups, then the other player can take the rest. But if they value cups, they might not accept. Alternatively, if I take one cup and some wires, maybe that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and both wires. Let me think. If I propose [Cup, Cup, Wire, Wire], then the other player would need to propose [Glass, Glass, Nail, Nail]. If their value function values those, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they don&#x27;t, they might not. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose one cup and one wire. Then the other player could take the other cup and the remaining wire, plus maybe some other items. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Another approach: since cups are worth 4 each, I should prioritize getting both. So I should propose both cups. Then, to make the proposal complementary, I need to include other items that the other player might not need. For example, if I take both cups and both wires, then the other player can take the glasses and nails. If they value those, then it&#x27;s good. If not, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and one wire. Then the other player could take the other wire and the rest. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Wait, the problem is that I have to make a secret proposal. The other player will also make a secret proposal. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are not too overlapping. For example, if I take both cups and both wires, then the other player can take the glasses and nails. If they value those, then it&#x27;s good. If not, they might not. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose one cup and one wire. Then the other player could take the other cup and the remaining wire, plus maybe some other items. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and one glass. But if the other player values glasses, they might take that. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and both nails. But nails are worth 0 to me, so that&#x27;s not helpful. But if the other player values nails, they might take them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Hmm. The safest bet is to take both cups, since they are the most valuable to me. So I should propose both cups. Then, to make the proposal complementary, I need to include other items. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Cup, Cup, Wire, Wire]. Then the other player would need to propose [Glass, Glass, Nail, Nail]. If their value function values those, then it&#x27;s complementary. If not, they might not. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a possible proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Cup, Cup, Glass, Glass]. But if the other player values glasses, they might take them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Cup, Cup, Nail, Nail]. But nails are worth 0 to me, so that&#x27;s not helpful. But if the other player values nails, they might take them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Cup, Cup, Wire, Glass]. But that&#x27;s four items. The other player would need to take the remaining items: 1 wire, 1 glass, 2 nails. But that&#x27;s not complementary because there are 2 wires, 2 glasses, etc. Wait, the total items are 2 of each. So if I take 2 cups, 1 wire, 1 glass, then the other player would need to take 1 wire, 1 glass, 2 nails. But that&#x27;s not complementary because there are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 nails, 2 cups. So if I take 2 cups, 1 wire, 1 glass, then the other player would need to take 1 wire, 1 glass, 2 nails. But that&#x27;s not all items. So that&#x27;s not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>So the proposal needs to include all items. Wait, no. The rule says that the proposals are complementary if there are enough items to satisfy both. So each item must be in exactly one of the proposals. So for example, if I propose [Cup, Cup, Wire, Wire], and the other player proposes [Glass, Glass, Nail, Nail], then all items are covered, so it&#x27;s complementary. That would be good.<br/><br/>So my proposal should be to take both cups and both wires. Then the other player would need to take the glasses and nails. If they value those, then we both get points. If not, they might not accept. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, this is a possible strategy.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and one wire. Then the other player could take the other wire and the rest. But that might not be complementary. For example, if I take 2 cups and 1 wire, then the other player would need to take 1 wire, 2 glasses, 2 nails. But that&#x27;s not all items. So that&#x27;s not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad.<br/><br/>Therefore, the best approach is to propose both cups and both wires. That way, the other player can take the remaining items (glasses and nails), and if their value function values those, then it&#x27;s complementary. If not, they might not accept, but at least I have a chance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and one glass. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose both cups and one nail. But nails are worth 0 to me, so that&#x27;s not helpful. But if the other player values nails, they might take them. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>So, given that, I think the best proposal is to take both cups and both wires. That way, the other player can take the remaining items. If they value those, then we both get points. If not, they might not, but it&#x27;s a risk I have to take.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 2 Cup, 2 Wire]<br/></p>
