                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on a split of the items. The items available are 3 pencils, 1 pen, and 2 nuts. My secret value function is pencils: 0, pen: 0, nuts: 5. So, I only care about nuts. The other player's values are unknown, but I need to consider possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value nuts as well, or maybe they prefer other items. But since my value for nuts is 5, I should prioritize getting as many nuts as possible.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don't exceed the available quantities), we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we get zero. So, the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, ensuring that our combined requests don't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. Maybe start by sending messages to gauge the other player's preferences. But since messages are public, I can't reveal my secret values. Alternatively, I could make a secret proposal early to lock in a deal.\n\nWait, the secret proposal is made in the format [Proposal: ...], and if both proposals are complementary, we get points. So, if I make a secret proposal, the other player might respond with their own. But if I don't make a secret proposal, I have to send messages to negotiate.\n\nBut the problem is that I don't know the other player's values. So, maybe the best approach is to propose taking all the nuts, since that's what I value. If the other player also values nuts, they might accept. If not, maybe they would take other items. But since I don't know, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my chances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the nuts and some other items that the other player might value. But since I don't know their values, it's risky. However, if I take all the nuts, that's 2 nuts. If the other player's proposal doesn't require more than 2 nuts, then it's complementary. But if they also want nuts, maybe they would take some, but I need to make sure that the total doesn't exceed.\n\nWait, the items are 3 pencils, 1 pen, 2 nuts. So, if I propose taking 2 nuts, and the other player proposes taking, say, 1 pen and 1 pencil, then combined, we have 2 nuts, 1 pen, 1 pencil. That's within the available items. So that would be complementary. But if the other player's proposal requires more than 2 nuts, then it's not complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose taking all the nuts. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 2 Nuts], then the other player might respond with their own proposal. If their proposal doesn't require more than 2 nuts, then we both get points. But if they also want nuts, maybe they would propose taking some, but if I already took all, then their proposal might conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to ask about their preferences. For example, ask if they value nuts. But since messages are public, I can't reveal my own values. So, maybe I can ask them what they value. But the problem is that I can't communicate directly; I have to send messages, and the other player can respond.\n\nBut the user is me, and I need to simulate the negotiation. Since I'm the one playing, I need to decide my actions. The initial step is to either send a message or make a secret proposal.\n\nGiven that I value nuts highly, maybe the best move is to make a secret proposal to take the 2 nuts. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't require more than 2 nuts, we both get points. If they do, then we get zero. But since I don't know their values, it's a gamble. However, if I don't make a secret proposal, I might have to negotiate through messages, which could be less efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player, asking them what they value. For example, \"Do you value nuts?\" But since messages are public, the other player might not reveal their values. But maybe they would respond with their own proposal.\n\nWait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and they can respond. So, if I send a message, the other player can reply. But I need to structure my messages to get information about their preferences.\n\nBut since I can only send up to 5 messages, I need to be efficient. Let me outline possible steps:\n\n1. Send a message to the other player asking about their preferences. For example, \"What do you value most?\" But the other player might not answer directly. Alternatively, I could propose a split and see their response.\n\n2. Alternatively, make a secret proposal early. For example, propose taking the 2 nuts. If the other player's proposal is compatible, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know my values, so they might not accept.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the safest bet is to propose taking the nuts. Let me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I propose [Proposal: 2 Nuts], then the other player's proposal must not require more than 2 nuts. If they propose, say, 1 pen and 1 pencil, then it's complementary. If they propose 2 nuts and 1 pen, then it's not complementary because there are only 2 nuts. So, in that case, we both get zero.\n\nBut if the other player's value for nuts is low, they might not want to take them. However, if they do value nuts, they might accept. But since I don't know, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 nut and some other items. But since I value nuts at 5, taking 1 nut gives me 5 points. If I take 2, that's 10. So, better to take as many as possible.\n\nBut the problem is that if the other player also wants nuts, they might propose taking some, leading to a conflict. So, maybe I should make a secret proposal to take all the nuts. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is made in the format [Proposal: ...], and if both are complementary, we get points. So, if I make a secret proposal of 2 nuts, and the other player's proposal is, say, 1 pen and 1 pencil, then it's complementary. So, I get 2*5=10 points, and they get their value for pen and pencil. But if their proposal requires more than 2 nuts, then it's not complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal for the nuts. Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to see if they are willing to take the nuts. For example, \"I value nuts highly. Would you like to take some?\" But again, the other player might not respond in a way that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a split that includes the nuts. For example, \"I propose taking 2 nuts and 1 pencil.\" But since I don't know their values, maybe they would accept if they value pencils. But if they don't, they might reject.\n\nThis is tricky. Since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to decide which path to take. Given that I have a high value for nuts, I should prioritize getting them. So, making a secret proposal for 2 nuts seems like a good move. If the other player's proposal is compatible, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, if I send a message to the other player, maybe I can get them to agree to take the nuts. For example, \"I want the nuts. Can we agree on that?\" But the other player might not respond favorably. However, if they do, then we can proceed.\n\nBut since I can't know their response, maybe the secret proposal is safer. Let me go with that. So, my first action is to make a secret proposal of 2 nuts. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't require more than 2 nuts, we both get points. If they do, we get zero. But since I don't know their values, it's a gamble. However, given that I value nuts highly, it's worth the risk.\n"
