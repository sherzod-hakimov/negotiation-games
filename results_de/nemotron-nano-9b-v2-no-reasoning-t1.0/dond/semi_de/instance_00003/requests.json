The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value.

So just a regular message.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But since the other player hasn't made any proposals yet, maybe it's better to start with a regular message.

Let me know your proposal.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that the message is not in the secret proposal format. So no brackets. Just a regular message. Then, the other player can respond with their proposal, either a regular message or a secret one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But since the other player hasn't made any proposals yet, maybe it's better to start with a regular message. Because if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know about it, and if they make a regular message, it might not be complementary.\n\nSo, I think the best first step is to send a regular message proposing the hat and all three pens. That's my best bet to get a complementary proposal. If they accept, great. If not, maybe I can adjust in subsequent messages.\n",
