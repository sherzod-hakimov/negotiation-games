        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret value function is candies worth 2 each, fruits 2 each, and hats 0. So hats don&#x27;t matter to me. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. The goal is to get a high score by having complementary proposals.<br/><br/>First, I should think about what items are valuable to me. Since candies and fruits are both worth 2, I should aim to get as many of those as possible. The hat is worthless to me, so maybe I can give that to the other player if it helps in making a complementary proposal.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don&#x27;t exceed the available quantities), then we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, doesn&#x27;t exceed the available items.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. Maybe start by sending a message to the other player to gauge their preferences. But since I can&#x27;t see their values, I have to make assumptions. Alternatively, I could make a secret proposal that maximizes my own gain while leaving enough items for the other player to also get something.<br/><br/>Let me consider possible proposals. If I take all 3 candies and 2 fruits, that&#x27;s 5 items. But the other player might need some items too. However, if I take all the candies and fruits, the other player might not have enough to make a complementary proposal. Alternatively, if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy, 1 fruit, and 1 hat. Then the other player could take the remaining items. But I need to make sure that their proposal plus mine doesn&#x27;t exceed the totals.<br/><br/>Wait, the hat is only 1. If I take the hat, that&#x27;s 0 for me, but maybe the other player values it. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s risky. Maybe better to leave the hat for them if they might value it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could propose taking 3 candies and 1 fruit. That leaves 1 fruit and 1 hat. If the other player takes those, then the total would be 3+1=4 candies (but there are only 3), so that&#x27;s not possible. Wait, no. If I take 3 candies and 1 fruit, the other player would need to take 0 candies, 1 fruit, and 1 hat. That would be complementary. But I don&#x27;t know if they would do that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 2 fruits. That would leave 1 candy and 1 hat. If the other player takes those, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving enough items for the other player to also get something. For example, if I take 3 candies and 1 fruit, that&#x27;s 3*2 + 1*2 = 8 points. Then the other player could take 1 fruit and 1 hat. If they value the fruit and hat, they might get some points. But if they don&#x27;t value the hat, maybe they would take the fruit. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 2 fruits. That&#x27;s 2*2 + 2*2 = 8 points. Then the other player could take 1 candy and 1 hat. If they value the candy, that&#x27;s good. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Wait, the hat is only 1. If I don&#x27;t take it, the other player might. But since I don&#x27;t know their value, maybe it&#x27;s better to leave it. But if I take it, I get 0, but maybe they don&#x27;t. But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s safer to not take it.<br/><br/>Another angle: since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe propose taking all the candies and fruits, but that might leave nothing for them. Alternatively, take some and leave some.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the hat. For example, [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits, 1 Hat]. But that would take all items. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they have a proposal, it might not be. But if I take everything, then their proposal would have to be empty. But if they have a proposal, it would conflict. So maybe that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 3 candies and 1 fruit. Then the other player could take 1 fruit and 1 hat. That would be complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>Since I can send messages, maybe I should first send a message to the other player to ask about their preferences. But the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and I can&#x27;t include any text except the secret proposal. So I need to send messages that are just the secret proposals or regular messages. Wait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and if it&#x27;s not a secret proposal, it&#x27;s directly sent. So I can send messages like &quot;How do you value the hat?&quot; but the problem is that the user is supposed to simulate the other player&#x27;s responses. But in this case, I&#x27;m the one playing, and the other player is another entity. But since I&#x27;m the one making the proposals, maybe I need to make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since I can make a secret proposal, maybe I should do that. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player would have to respond with their own. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Given that I value candies and fruits equally, and the hat is worthless, I should aim to get as many candies and fruits as possible. The hat is 1, so maybe I can give that to the other player if they value it. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should not take it.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal could be [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. That would take all the candies and fruits. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is empty, then it&#x27;s complementary. But if they have a proposal, say, taking the hat, then it&#x27;s not. But if they don&#x27;t take anything, then it&#x27;s okay. However, if they take the hat, then the total would be 3+0=3 candies, 2+0=2 fruits, 1+1=2 hats. But the available hats are 1, so that&#x27;s okay. Wait, no. The total items would be 3 candies (me) + 0 (them) = 3, which is okay. 2 fruits (me) + 0 (them) = 2, okay. 1 hat (them) + 0 (me) = 1, okay. So that would be complementary. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the hat, then it&#x27;s okay. But if they propose something else, like taking some candies, then it might not be.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 3 candies and 2 fruits, and the other player proposes 1 hat, then it&#x27;s complementary. So that would work. But if they propose something else, like 1 candy, then it&#x27;s not. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is a good proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 candies and 2 fruits. That leaves 1 candy and 1 hat. If the other player takes those, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>But since I can only make a secret proposal once, or send messages. The user is asking me to start the game. So I need to make my first move. Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. But the first move is to either send a message or make a secret proposal.<br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to decide whether to send a message or make a secret proposal. Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, maybe making a secret proposal is better. Because if I send a message, the other player might respond, but I can&#x27;t be sure. But if I make a secret proposal, then the other player has to respond with their own.<br/><br/>But the problem is that I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. So maybe the best approach is to propose taking all the candies and fruits, and leave the hat for the other player. Because if they take the hat, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they don&#x27;t, then maybe they take nothing, which is also complementary. But if they take some items, it might not be.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 3 candies and 1 fruit. That leaves 1 fruit and 1 hat. If the other player takes those, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 2 fruits. That leaves 1 candy and 1 hat. If the other player takes those, then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, not sure.<br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to take as much as possible of the valuable items. So 3 candies and 2 fruits. That&#x27;s 5 items. The hat is 1. If the other player takes the hat, then it&#x27;s complementary. If they don&#x27;t, then they might take nothing, which is also complementary. So that&#x27;s a good proposal.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. That way, I get all the valuable items, and the other player can take the hat if they want. If they don&#x27;t, then they get nothing, but that&#x27;s still complementary. So this seems like a good move.<br/></p>
