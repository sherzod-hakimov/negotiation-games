                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on how to split the items. The items available are 2 threads, 3 nuts, and 1 picture. My secret value function is threads: 0, nuts: 1, picture: 7. So the picture is super valuable to me, threads don't matter, and nuts are worth 1 each.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is to find a complementary proposal where both get enough items. If we can't agree, both get zero. So I need to propose something that the other player would accept, and vice versa.\n\nSince the picture is worth 7 to me, I should definitely try to get that. But if I take the picture, the other player might not want to give up anything else. Alternatively, maybe they value the picture less. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. However, since the picture is the highest value item for me, I should prioritize getting it.\n\nThe other items are threads (which I don't care about) and nuts (which I value at 1 each). If I can get the picture and some nuts, that would be good. But I need to make sure the other player also gets enough. Let's think about possible proposals.\n\nIf I propose taking the picture and maybe some nuts, but the other player might need to take the rest. For example, if I take the picture and 2 nuts, then the other player would need to take the remaining 1 nut and 2 threads. But if the other player values nuts more than me, they might not accept that. Alternatively, if I take the picture and all 3 nuts, then the other player gets 2 threads. But if they don't value threads, they might not accept. However, since threads are worth 0 to me, maybe they value them more. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the picture less. If I can get the picture and some nuts, and they get the rest. But I need to make a proposal that they would accept. Since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nThe first step is to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to decide what to propose. Let's think: if I propose taking the picture and 3 nuts, that would be [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 nuts]. Then the other player would need to take 2 threads. If they accept, I get 7 + 3*1 = 10 points. They get 2*0 (if they value threads 0) or maybe they value threads more. But since I don't know their values, this is a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 2 nuts, leaving 1 nut and 2 threads for them. If they accept, I get 7 + 2 = 9, and they get 1*1 (if they value nuts) plus 2*their value for threads. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the picture more. If I don't take the picture, they might. But since I value it highly, I should try to get it. So the best bet is to propose taking the picture and as many nuts as possible. But I need to make sure that the other player can take the remaining items. If I take the picture and 3 nuts, they get 2 threads. If they value threads, maybe they accept. If not, they might not. But since I can't know, I have to take a chance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 1 nut, leaving 2 nuts and 2 threads. That way, the other player might have more nuts to take. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAnother approach: since threads are worthless to me, maybe I can offer them to the other player. For example, if I take the picture and 3 nuts, and give them 2 threads. But if they don't value threads, they might not accept. Alternatively, if I take the picture and 2 nuts, and give them 1 nut and 2 threads. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the picture less. If I can get the picture and some nuts, and they take the rest. But I need to make a proposal that they would accept. Since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be strategic.\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items to satisfy both, then both get their scores. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to find a proposal where the items I want and the items the other wants don't overlap. So if I propose taking the picture and some nuts, and they propose taking the remaining nuts and threads, that could work.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the other player values the picture less than me. So they might be willing to take the threads and some nuts. Alternatively, maybe they value nuts more. But without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 3 nuts, and hope they take the threads. If they do, I get 7 + 3 = 10. If not, we both get zero. Alternatively, if I propose taking the picture and 2 nuts, and they take 1 nut and 2 threads. If they accept, I get 7 + 2 = 9, and they get 1 + 2*their value for threads. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 1 nut, leaving 2 nuts and 2 threads. If they take the 2 nuts and 2 threads, that's possible. But again, depends on their values.\n\nSince I can't know, maybe the safest bet is to propose taking the picture and as many nuts as possible, because the picture is my highest value. So I'll go with [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 nuts]. That way, if they accept, I get 10 points. If not, we both get zero. But maybe they would accept if they can get the threads. Alternatively, if they value threads, they might take them. But if they don't, they might not. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 2 nuts, leaving 1 nut and 2 threads. If they take the 1 nut and 2 threads, that's possible. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAnother thought: since threads are worth 0 to me, maybe the other player values them. If I can give them the threads, they might accept. So if I take the picture and 3 nuts, and give them 2 threads. If they accept, I get 10, they get 2*their value for threads. If they value threads, that's good. If not, they might not. But again, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 1 nut, and give them 2 nuts and 2 threads. But that might not be as good for me.\n\nHmm. I think the best approach is to propose taking the picture and 3 nuts. That's the maximum I can get. If the other player is willing to take the threads, then it's a win. If not, we both lose. But since I can't know, this is the best possible proposal. So I'll make that secret proposal.\n"
