Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Topf, 1 Süßigkeit, 1 Pfeife, 2 Würfel\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nTopf: 2, Süßigkeit: 3, Pfeife: 3, Würfel: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. The items are 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 pipe, and 2 dice. My secret values are pot:2, candy:3, pipe:3, dice:1. So I value candy and pipe the most, then pot, then dice least.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. Maybe start by sending messages to gauge their preferences. But since messages are public, I have to be careful not to reveal too much. Alternatively, maybe make a secret proposal early to lock in a deal.\n\nWait, the rules say that each can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should first send some messages to learn about their preferences. But since I don't know their values, maybe I need to propose something that's likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, since I can make a secret proposal, maybe I should do that. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player might respond with their own. If they are complementary, we both get points. If not, zero. So I need to propose something that's likely to be complementary.\n\nWhat's a good proposal? Let's see. The items are pot, candy, pipe, two dice. I need to assign these to myself and the other player. Since I value candy and pipe highly, I should try to get those. But if the other player also values them, there might be a conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose taking the items I value most. For example, propose [Candy, Pipe]. Then the other player might propose the remaining items. But if they also want candy or pipe, that would conflict. Alternatively, maybe propose [Pot, Candy, Pipe] and leave the dice. But that might be too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the items in a way that covers all. For example, I take candy and pipe, and the other player takes pot and dice. But if the other player values pot more, that could be good. Or maybe I take candy and one die, and the other takes pot, pipe, and the other die. But I need to make sure that the total items are covered.\n\nWait, the items are 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 pipe, 2 dice. So total items are 4. Each proposal must cover all items. So if I propose [Candy, Pipe], the other player must propose [Pot, Dice, Dice]. If that's the case, then if their proposal is complementary, we both get points. But if their proposal is different, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose [Candy, Pipe, Dice] and the other player would need to take [Pot, Dice]. But again, depends on their values.\n\nSince I can't know their values, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving enough for the other player. For example, if I take candy and pipe, which are my highest values, and leave pot and dice. But if the other player also values pot, that might be okay. Alternatively, if I take candy and one die, and the other takes pot, pipe, and the other die. But I need to make sure that the total items are covered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Candy, Pipe] and hope the other player takes the rest. But if they also want candy or pipe, that would conflict. So maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by the other player. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe make a secret proposal that includes the items I value most, and see if the other player's proposal complements it. For example, if I propose [Candy, Pipe], then the other player's proposal would need to include pot and both dice. If they do that, then we both get points. If not, zero.\n\nBut since I can't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as comprehensive as possible. Wait, but the problem is that if my proposal and theirs are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with theirs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to ask about their preferences. For example, ask if they value pot, candy, etc. But since messages are public, I have to be careful. For example, I could send a message like \"Do you value the pot more than the dice?\" But the other player might not answer directly. However, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, so maybe I can use that to gather information.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any previous messages, so I need to start from scratch. The initial step is to either send a message or make a secret proposal. Since I can make a secret proposal at any time, maybe I should do that first. Let me think about what a good secret proposal would be.\n\nIf I propose [Candy, Pipe], then the other player's proposal would need to include pot and both dice. If they do that, then we both get points. If they propose something else, like [Pot, Candy], then it's not complementary. So maybe I should propose [Candy, Pipe] as my secret proposal. Alternatively, maybe [Candy, Pipe, Dice] to cover more items, but that might leave less for the other player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Pot, Candy, Pipe] and leave the dice. But that's three items, and the other player would need to take the two dice. But if they value the dice, that's okay. However, if they don't, maybe they would propose something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the dice. For example, I take one die, and the other takes the other. But since there are two dice, that's possible. So my proposal could be [Candy, Pipe, Dice], and the other's would be [Pot, Dice]. That would cover all items. If their proposal is that, then it's complementary. But again, depends on their values.\n\nSince I don't know their values, maybe the safest bet is to propose the items I value most, which are candy and pipe. So my secret proposal would be [Candy, Pipe]. Then the other player's proposal would need to include pot and both dice. If they do that, we both get points. If not, zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose [Candy, Pipe, Dice] to cover more items, but that might not be necessary. Let me calculate the value. If I get candy (3) and pipe (3), that's 6. If I also get a die (1), that's 7. But if the other player takes pot (2) and the other die (1), that's 3. So total points would be 7 + 3 = 10. But if the other player's proposal is not complementary, we get zero. So it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Candy, Pipe], and the other player proposes [Pot, Dice, Dice], then I get 3+3=6, and they get 2+1+1=4. Total 10. That's better than if I take more items but risk a conflict.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. Since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary. So [Candy, Pipe] is a good start. Let me go with that.\n",
