        <p>Okay, I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to approach this negotiation. So, the goal is to select a set of items that maximize my personal importance values without exceeding the maximum effort of 2307. I can only communicate through specific formats: Vorschlag, Ablehnung, Argument, Zustimmung.<br/><br/>First, I should list out all the items with their effort and importance from my perspective. Let me make two tables: one sorted by effort and another sorted by importance. That might help me prioritize.<br/><br/>Looking at the efforts:<br/><br/>Effort:<br/>A03: 43<br/>C32: 51<br/>C62: 106<br/>A07: 356<br/>A83: 80<br/>C81: 255<br/>B38: 276<br/>C03: 543<br/>C10: 325<br/>C00: 308<br/>C56: 588<br/>C38: 698<br/>C08: 743<br/>C76: 147<br/>C98: 95<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s not sorted. Let me sort them properly.<br/><br/>Sorted by effort:<br/>1. A03:43<br/>2. C32:51<br/>3. A83:80<br/>4. C98:95<br/>5. C76:147<br/>6. C62:106<br/>7. C81:255<br/>8. B38:276<br/>9. A07:356<br/>10. C10:325<br/>11. C00:308<br/>12. C56:588<br/>13. C03:543<br/>14. C38:698<br/>15. C08:743<br/><br/>Wait, I think I messed up the order because I didn&#x27;t sort correctly. Let me list all items with their effort:<br/><br/>- A03:43<br/>- C32:51<br/>- C62:106<br/>- A83:80<br/>- C98:95<br/>- C76:147<br/>- B38:276<br/>- C81:255<br/>- A07:356<br/>- C10:325<br/>- C00:308<br/>- C56:588<br/>- C03:543<br/>- C38:698<br/>- C08:743<br/><br/>Wait, no, I&#x27;m getting confused. Let me just list all 15 items correctly:<br/><br/>Wait, the effort list provided is:<br/><br/>Aufwand der Gegenstände = {&quot;C76&quot;: 147, &quot;C38&quot;: 698, &quot;C56&quot;: 588, &quot;A03&quot;: 43, &quot;A07&quot;: 356, &quot;A83&quot;: 80, &quot;C98&quot;: 95, &quot;C08&quot;: 743, &quot;C62&quot;: 106, &quot;C00&quot;: 308, &quot;C10&quot;: 325, &quot;C81&quot;: 255, &quot;B38&quot;: 276, &quot;C03&quot;: 543, &quot;C32&quot;: 51}<br/><br/>So let&#x27;s extract them as a list with keys and values:<br/><br/>[<br/>(&quot;C76&quot;,147),<br/>(&quot;C38&quot;,698),<br/>(&quot;C56&quot;,588),<br/>(&quot;A03&quot;,43),<br/>(&quot;A07&quot;,356),<br/>(&quot;A83&quot;,80),<br/>(&quot;C98&quot;,95),<br/>(&quot;C08&quot;,743),<br/>(&quot;C62&quot;,106),<br/>(&quot;C00&quot;,308),<br/>(&quot;C10&quot;,325),<br/>(&quot;C81&quot;,255),<br/>(&quot;B38&quot;,276),<br/>(&quot;C03&quot;,543),<br/>(&quot;C32&quot;,51)<br/>]<br/><br/>Now, sort by effort value:<br/><br/>Sorted by effort ascending:<br/><br/>A03:43<br/>C32:51<br/>A83:80<br/>C98:95<br/>C76:147<br/>C62:106 --&gt; Wait, C62 is 106 which is higher than C76&#x27;s 147? No, 106 is less than 147. So the order after A83 is C98:95, then C76:147, then C62:106? No, wait. Actually, 80 (A83), then 95 (C98), then 106 (C62), then 147 (C76), then 255 (C81), then 276 (B38), 308 (C00), 325 (C10), 356 (A07), 543 (C03), 588 (C56), 698 (C38), 743 (C08).<br/><br/>No, wait, perhaps I should list them in order from smallest to largest effort:<br/><br/>1. A03 (43)<br/>2. C32 (51)<br/>3. A83 (80)<br/>4. C98 (95)<br/>5. C62 (106)<br/>6. C76 (147)<br/>7. C81 (255)<br/>8. B38 (276)<br/>9. C00 (308)<br/>10. C10 (325)<br/>11. A07 (356)<br/>12. C03 (543)<br/>13. C56 (588)<br/>14. C38 (698)<br/>15. C08 (743)<br/><br/>That seems right.<br/><br/>Now, my importance values:<br/><br/>Werte der Gegenstandswichtigkeit = {&quot;C76&quot;: 138, &quot;C38&quot;: 583, &quot;C56&quot;: 65, &quot;A03&quot;: 262, &quot;A07&quot;: 121, &quot;A83&quot;: 508, &quot;C98&quot;: 461, &quot;C08&quot;: 484, &quot;C62&quot;: 668, &quot;C00&quot;: 389, &quot;C10&quot;: 215, &quot;C81&quot;: 97, &quot;B38&quot;: 500, &quot;C03&quot;: 30, &quot;C32&quot;: 400}<br/><br/>So for each item, importance is:<br/><br/>A03:262<br/>A07:121<br/>A83:508<br/>B38:500<br/>C00:389<br/>C03:30<br/>C08:484<br/>C10:215<br/>C32:400<br/>C38:583<br/>C56:65<br/>C62:668<br/>C76:138<br/>C81:97<br/>C98:461<br/><br/>My goal is to maximize the sum of these importance values without the total effort exceeding 2307.<br/><br/>This sounds like a knapsack problem. Given that, I should probably try to prioritize items with the highest importance per unit effort, but considering the other player&#x27;s preferences, which I don&#x27;t know. Since it&#x27;s a negotiation, I might need to find a balance between high-importance items for me and possibly considering the other&#x27;s priorities without knowing them.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s importance is hidden, I can&#x27;t know for sure, but I can try to propose sets that are efficient for me and maybe leave out items that are less important to me but could be important to them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since the other player is trying to maximize their own importance, which I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I should aim for a solution that is efficient for me while leaving some flexibility.<br/><br/>Let me try to calculate the importance per effort for each item:<br/><br/>For each item, importance / effort:<br/><br/>A03:262 /43 ≈6.093<br/>C32:400 /51 ≈7.843<br/>A83:508 /80 ≈6.35<br/>C98:461 /95 ≈4.852<br/>C62:668 /106 ≈6.302<br/>C76:138 /147 ≈0.938<br/>C81:97 /255 ≈0.380<br/>B38:500 /276 ≈1.812<br/>C00:389 /308 ≈1.263<br/>C10:215 /325 ≈0.662<br/>A07:121 /356 ≈0.340<br/>C03:30 /543 ≈0.055<br/>C56:65 /588 ≈0.110<br/>C38:583 /698 ≈0.835<br/>C08:484 /743 ≈0.652<br/><br/>So sorting by importance/effort ratio:<br/><br/>1. C32:7.843<br/>2. A03:6.093<br/>3. A83:6.35<br/>4. C62:6.302<br/>5. C98:4.852<br/>6. C76:0.938<br/>7. B38:1.812<br/>8. C00:1.263<br/>9. C08:0.652<br/>10. C10:0.662<br/>11. A07:0.340<br/>12. C56:0.110<br/>13. C38:0.835<br/>14. C81:0.380<br/>15. C03:0.055<br/><br/>Wait, no, I think I should arrange them from highest to lowest ratio:<br/><br/>C32 (7.843), A03 (6.093), A83 (6.35), C62 (6.302), C98 (4.852), B38 (1.812), C38 (0.835), C76 (0.938), C00 (1.263), C08 (0.652), C10 (0.662), C56 (0.110), A07 (0.340), C81 (0.380), C03 (0.055).<br/><br/>Wait, actually, let&#x27;s list them correctly:<br/><br/>Sorted by ratio descending:<br/><br/>1. C32:7.843<br/>2. A03:6.093<br/>3. A83:6.35<br/>4. C62:6.302<br/>5. C98:4.852<br/>6. B38:1.812<br/>7. C00:1.263<br/>8. C38:0.835<br/>9. C76:0.938<br/>10. C08:0.652<br/>11. C10:0.662<br/>12. C56:0.110<br/>13. A07:0.340<br/>14. C81:0.380<br/>15. C03:0.055<br/><br/>Wait, some of these are lower, like C03 is 0.055. So perhaps I should focus on the top ones.<br/><br/>So, the top 5 are C32, A03, A83, C62, C98.<br/><br/>Let me try to see how much effort these would take and their total importance.<br/><br/>C32:51 effort, 400 importance<br/>A03:43 effort, 262<br/>A83:80, 508<br/>C62:106, 668<br/>C98:95, 461<br/><br/>Adding up their efforts: 51+43=94, +80=174, +106=280, +95=375.<br/><br/>So together, these 5 items take 375 effort, leaving 2307-375=1932.<br/><br/>But that&#x27;s just 5 items. Maybe I can include more, but perhaps there&#x27;s a better combination.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe C32 is the highest ratio, so adding it first.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe including C62 which has high importance but also high effort.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps trying to include as many high-ratio items as possible.<br/><br/>But let me think about possible combinations.<br/><br/>Another approach is to find the maximum importance without exceeding 2307.<br/><br/>But this might take too long manually. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to propose a set that includes the highest importance items for me, and see how the other player reacts.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their importance, I need to be strategic.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can&#x27;t reveal my importance, so I have to argue based on the effort and maybe the number of items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make a proposal that includes items with the highest importance to me, and argue that they are essential, hoping that the other player finds the set acceptable.<br/><br/>Looking at the top 5:<br/><br/>Total effort: 51+43+80+106+95=375<br/><br/>Total importance:400+262+508+668+461=2299<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a good start, but I can probably add more items.<br/><br/>Next, look for the next highest ratio: B38 (1.812), but that&#x27;s much lower. Let&#x27;s see.<br/><br/>What if I add C38? Its ratio is 0.835, which is lower.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe adding lower ratio items that don&#x27;t consume too much effort.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps adding A07 (effort 356, importance 121) is a bad idea because of the low ratio.<br/><br/>Alternatively, C00: effort 308, importance 389, ratio 1.263.<br/><br/>Wait, but 1.263 is better than B38&#x27;s 1.812? No, 1.812 is better than 1.263. So B38 is better in terms of ratio.<br/><br/>Wait no, 1.812 &gt; 1.263, so B38 is better.<br/><br/>So, after the first 5, adding B38 (effort 276, imp 500) would add 276 to effort, making total effort 375+276=651, leaving 2307-651=1656.<br/><br/>But 276 is a significant chunk.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take smaller effort items.<br/><br/>Looking back, after the top 5, what&#x27;s next:<br/><br/>C00:308, 389 imp, ratio ~1.26<br/><br/>Adding C00 to the first 5:<br/><br/>Total effort:375+308=683<br/><br/>Importance:2299+389=2688<br/><br/>Then, next, perhaps B38:276, adding to 683+276=959, with importance +500=3188<br/><br/>Then, C10:325, which has low ratio, but adding it would make effort 959+325=1284, imp +215=3188+215=3403<br/><br/>Then, C76:147, imp 138, ratio 0.938, but perhaps adding it: effort 1284+147=1431, imp 3403+138=3541<br/><br/>Then, C08:743, which is a big effort. Adding that would overshoot: 1431+743=2174, leaving 133.<br/><br/>Not useful, since 133 is too small for any remaining items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after adding C10, perhaps add C56:588 effort, imp 65, ratio 0.110. That&#x27;s not useful.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps after the first 5 items (375 effort, 2299 imp), add B38 (276) and C00 (308).<br/><br/>Wait, 375+276=651, 651+308=959<br/><br/>Total imp:2299+500+389=3188<br/><br/>Then, next, perhaps C08 is too big. Maybe C76 (147): adding to 959+147=1106, imp +138=3326<br/><br/>Or C38:698. Too big, as 959+698=1657, leaving 650.<br/><br/>But perhaps C56 is 588, which is too much.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can consider including some lower effort items.<br/><br/>Wait, but 51+43+80+106+95+276+308= 51+43=94 +80=174 +106=280 +95=375 +276=651 +308=959<br/><br/>That&#x27;s seven items, total effort 959, imp 2299+500+389=3188<br/><br/>Wait, but I think I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself. Since I can&#x27;t compute all possible combinations, maybe I should start by making a proposal that includes the top items for me and see if the other player accepts.<br/><br/>So, my initial proposal would include:<br/><br/>C32, A03, A83, C62, C98<br/><br/>Effort:51+43+80+106+95=375, which is way under 2307. So I can probably add more.<br/><br/>But maybe I should include some medium-effort items. Let me try adding C32, A03, A83, C62, C98, B38, and C00.<br/><br/>Effort:51+43+80+106+95+276+308= 51+43=94+80=174+106=280+95=375+276=651+308=959<br/><br/>Importance:400+262+508+668+461+500+389= let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>400+262=662<br/><br/>662+508=1170<br/><br/>1170+668=1838<br/><br/>1838+461=2299<br/><br/>2299+500=2799<br/><br/>2799+389=3188<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a total of 3188 importance, effort 959. That leaves 2307-959=1348.<br/><br/>Maybe I can add more. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s left:<br/><br/>Remaining items:<br/><br/>C76 (147), C81 (255), A07 (356), C10 (325), C03 (543), C56 (588), C38 (698), C08 (743)<br/><br/>I can try to add the next best items in terms of importance/effort ratio.<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining, the next best ratio is C76:0.938, then C38:0.835, then C08:0.652, C10:0.662, etc.<br/><br/>So, let&#x27;s try adding C76:147, imp 138. Adding to effort 959+147=1106, imp 3188+138=3326<br/><br/>Next, C38:698, imp 583. Adding that would make effort 1106+698=1804, imp 3326+583=3909<br/><br/>Then, C08:743 would take us to 1804+743=2547, which is over the limit, as we have only 2307. So that&#x27;s too much.<br/><br/>Alternatively, after adding C76, we have 1106 effort. What else can we add without exceeding?<br/><br/>Remaining effort:2307-1106=1201<br/><br/>Looking for items with effort &lt;=1201. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C38:698 (we can add that, effort becomes 1106+698=1804, imp 3326+583=3909<br/><br/>Remaining effort:2307-1804=503<br/><br/>Next, what&#x27;s left: C08 (743) too big, C56:588, which is bigger than 503, no. C03:543, too big, but 543&gt;503. So no. C10:325, which fits.<br/><br/>So adding C10:325, effort 1804+325=2129, imp 3909+215=4124<br/><br/>Remaining effort:2307-2129=178<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items: C56:588, C03:543, C08:743, C76:147 (already included), etc. But nothing left fits because 178 is too small. So perhaps that&#x27;s a good set.<br/><br/>So the proposed set is:<br/><br/>C32, A03, A83, C62, C98, B38, C00, C76, C38, C10<br/><br/>Effort:51+43+80+106+95+276+308+147+698+325<br/><br/>Let me calculate:<br/><br/>51+43=94<br/><br/>+80=174<br/><br/>+106=280<br/><br/>+95=375<br/><br/>+276=651<br/><br/>+308=959<br/><br/>+147=1106<br/><br/>+698=1804<br/><br/>+325=2129<br/><br/>Yes, 2129 total effort, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>Importance:400+262+508+668+461+500+389+138+583+215=?<br/><br/>400+262=662<br/><br/>+508=1170<br/><br/>+668=1838<br/><br/>+461=2299<br/><br/>+500=2799<br/><br/>+389=3188<br/><br/>+138=3326<br/><br/>+583=3909<br/><br/>+215=4124<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a total importance of 4124, which seems pretty high.<br/><br/>But maybe I can include more. Wait, is there any item left that I can add without exceeding?<br/><br/>We have 2307-2129=178 left.<br/><br/>Looking at remaining items: A07 (356), which is too big. C56:588, too big. C03:543, too big. C08:743, too big. So nothing left can be added.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps we can swap some items to get a better total.<br/><br/>For example, if I remove C76 (147, imp138) and C38 (698,583), that would free up 147+698=845 effort. But that might not be a good idea because C38 gives a lot of importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can include C08 instead of some other high-effort items, but that might not be better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should stop here.<br/><br/>So, perhaps my initial proposal would be this set:<br/><br/>{&quot;C32&quot;, &quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;}<br/><br/>But maybe I should test whether the effort is within 2307.<br/><br/>Yes, 2129 is under 2307.<br/><br/>But let me check the sum again:<br/><br/>51 (C32) +43 (A03) =94<br/><br/>+80 (A83)=174<br/><br/>+106 (C62)=280<br/><br/>+95 (C98)=375<br/><br/>+276 (B38)=651<br/><br/>+308 (C00)=959<br/><br/>+147 (C76)=1106<br/><br/>+698 (C38)=1804<br/><br/>+325 (C10)=2129<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>So maybe I can make this my Vorschlag.<br/><br/>But perhaps the other player might prefer different items. So I should also think about possible arguments.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make a more minimal proposal to test the waters, but given that the goal is to maximize my importance, I think starting with this set is good.<br/><br/>But maybe I&#x27;m being too aggressive, and the other player might reject it because it&#x27;s too biased towards my interests. So perhaps I should balance it by including some items that might be important to them, even if they aren&#x27;t as important to me.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their importance, it&#x27;s hard. So perhaps I can include a mix of high importance for me and some mid-level ones.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose this set and then argue that it&#x27;s efficient and includes a good number of items without exceeding the effort, which is beneficial for both.<br/><br/>So, my first move would be to make a Vorschlag with these items and argue that it&#x27;s a good balance.<br/><br/>But let me make sure to check the total effort again:<br/><br/>Calculating step by step:<br/><br/>C32:51<br/><br/>A03:43 → 51+43=94<br/><br/>A83:80 → 94+80=174<br/><br/>C62:106 → 174+106=280<br/><br/>C98:95 →280+95=375<br/><br/>B38:276 →375+276=651<br/><br/>C00:308 →651+308=959<br/><br/>C76:147 →959+147=1106<br/><br/>C38:698 →1106+698=1804<br/><br/>C10:325 →1804+325=2129<br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>So, my proposal is these 10 items, with total effort 2129, which leaves room for 2307-2129=178. Not sure if that&#x27;s necessary, but perhaps it&#x27;s a good starting point.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can include one more item, but the remaining items are all above 178 effort. So no.<br/><br/>Thus, my first Vorschlag would be:<br/><br/>{&quot;C32&quot;, &quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;}<br/><br/>And I&#x27;ll include an argument that this selection efficiently uses the effort and includes a good number of high-value items without exceeding the limit.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 (Negotiator) to Player 2 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p2" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to respond to the other player&#x27;s proposal. Let me start by understanding the situation.<br/><br/>First, the other player has made an initial proposal with the following items: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}. The argument given is that these items use the available effort efficiently and provide a good mix of important items for them without exceeding the maximum effort of 2307. The total effort here is 2129, which leaves some room.<br/><br/>Now, I need to evaluate this proposal from my perspective. I have my own importance values for each item, which are different from the other player&#x27;s. My goal is to maximize my own total importance while ensuring the total effort doesn&#x27;t exceed 2307.<br/><br/>Let me list out the items in their proposal and calculate their importance according to my values:<br/><br/>- A03: 400<br/>- A83: 97<br/>- B38: 121<br/>- C00: 389<br/>- C10: 461<br/>- C32: 262<br/>- C38: 65<br/>- C62: 30<br/>- C76: 484<br/>- C98: 215<br/><br/>Adding these up: 400 +97=497 +121=618 +389=1007 +461=1468 +262=1730 +65=1795 +30=1825 +484=2309 +215=2524. Wait, that can&#x27;t be right because 2524 is way higher than the possible maximum. Oh, wait, no, I think I messed up adding. Let me recalculate step by step.<br/><br/>A03: 400<br/>A83: 97 (Total: 497)<br/>B38: 121 (Total: 618)<br/>C00: 389 (Total: 1007)<br/>C10: 461 (Total: 1468)<br/>C32: 262 (Total: 1730)<br/>C38: 65 (Total: 1795)<br/>C62: 30 (Total: 1825)<br/>C76: 484 (Total: 2309)<br/>C98: 215 (Total: 2524)<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s definitely over 2309? No, wait, no, that&#x27;s the importance total, not the effort. The effort is the sum of the effort values. So the effort for each item:<br/><br/>A03:43, A83:80, B38:276, C00:308, C10:325, C32:51, C38:698, C62:106, C76:147, C98:95.<br/><br/>Let me sum these efforts:<br/><br/>43 (A03) +80 =123 (A83)<br/>+276 =399 (B38)<br/>+308 =707 (C00)<br/>+325 =1032 (C10)<br/>+51 =1083 (C32)<br/>+698 =1781 (C38)<br/>+106 =1887 (C62)<br/>+147 =2034 (C76)<br/>+95 =2129 (C98)<br/><br/>So total effort is 2129, which is under 2307. That&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Now, looking at the importance from my side: the sum is 2524 as I calculated before. Is that the maximum? Or can I get a higher total importance by selecting a different combination?<br/><br/>My first thought is to see if I can swap out some items that are less important to me but free up effort to include more important ones. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s in the proposal and what I can replace.<br/><br/>Looking at the items in the proposal, the one with the lowest importance to me is C62 at 30, followed by C38 at 65. Maybe I can remove one or both and see what else I can add without exceeding the effort.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s calculate the effort of C62 and C38: C62 is 106, C38 is 698.<br/><br/>If I remove both, that frees up 106 + 698 = 804 effort.<br/><br/>What can I add with that effort? Let&#x27;s look at the remaining items not in the proposal and their effort:<br/><br/>C56: effort 588, importance 583<br/>C08: effort 743, importance 138<br/>C03: effort 543, importance 668<br/>A07: effort 356, importance 500<br/>C81: effort 255, importance 508<br/><br/>If I remove C62 (106) and C38 (698), which total 804, I could potentially add C56 (588) and C03 (543), but their total effort would be 588+543=1131, which is more than the 804 we freed. So maybe I can add one of them.<br/><br/>Adding C56 (588) would require effort. Let&#x27;s see: 2129 - 804 = 1325. If I add C56 (588), the new total effort would be 1325 + 588 = 1913. Then I have 2307 -1913=394 effort left. Maybe I can add something else. Let&#x27;s check:<br/><br/>What other items are not in the proposal and have effort ≤ 394.<br/><br/>C81: 255<br/>A07:356<br/>C03:543 (too big)<br/>C08:743 (too big)<br/>C56 is already being considered.<br/><br/>So, if I add C56 and C81, effort would be 588+255=843. Total effort after removing C62 and C38 (804) would be 1325, adding C56 and C81 would be 1325 + 843=2168, which is under 2307. But wait, no: the initial total was 2129. If I remove 804, I have 2129-804=1325. Adding 588+255=843 would make the total 1325+843=2168, which is within the limit. So that&#x27;s doable.<br/><br/>Now, let&#x27;s compare the importance:<br/><br/>Original proposal&#x27;s importance: 2524.<br/><br/>If I remove C62 (30) and C38 (65), I lose 95 importance. Adding C56 (583) and C81 (508) gives me 583+508=1091. So the new total would be 2524 -95 +1091= 2524-95=2429 +1091=3520? Wait, that can&#x27;t be right because the initial total was 2524, subtracting 95 gives 2429, adding 1091 gives 3520? That seems way too high, but let me check the numbers again.<br/><br/>Wait, no, I think I&#x27;m confusing the sums. Let me recalculate the total importance correctly.<br/><br/>Initial sum: 400+97+121+389+461+262+65+30+484+215= let&#x27;s compute step by step.<br/><br/>400 (A03) +97=497<br/>+121=618 (B38)<br/>+389=1007 (C00)<br/>+461=1468 (C10)<br/>+262=1730 (C32)<br/>+65=1795 (C38)<br/>+30=1825 (C62)<br/>+484=2309 (C76)<br/>+215=2524 (C98).<br/><br/>Yes, so 2524 is correct.<br/><br/>If I remove C38 (65) and C62 (30), that&#x27;s subtracting 95, so 2524-95=2429.<br/><br/>Adding C56 (583) and C81 (508) adds 583+508=1091, so total becomes 2429+1091=3520. That&#x27;s a significant increase in my total importance. But wait, is the effort within the limit?<br/><br/>Effort after removal: 2129-698-106=2129-804=1325.<br/><br/>Adding C56 (588) and C81 (255): 588+255=843. Total effort:1325+843=2168, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>So this would allow me to get a higher total importance. But I need to check if this is possible.<br/><br/>But wait, is there any overlap or is that the correct way? Let me double-check the effort.<br/><br/>Original effort:2129.<br/><br/>Removing C38 (698) and C62 (106) saves 804. So remaining effort is 2129-804=1325.<br/><br/>Adding C56 (588) and C81 (255) uses 843. 1325+843=2168, which is within 2307. So yes, it&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>Therefore, I could propose removing C38 and C62 and adding C56 and C81. But perhaps there&#x27;s an even better combination.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I could remove just C62 and see what I can add.<br/><br/>If I remove C62 (effort 106), freeing up 106. Then I can add C81 (255) and have 106-255 negative, which isn&#x27;t possible. So that&#x27;s not useful. Alternatively, adding C56 (588) would need more effort than I freed, but that&#x27;s 588, so 588&gt;106. So can&#x27;t do that.<br/><br/>Same with removing C38 (698). If I remove C38, I free up 698. Then I can add C56 (588) and maybe another small item. 698-588=110 left. Are there any items with effort &lt;=110? Let&#x27;s see: C32 is 51, but it&#x27;s already in the proposal. So adding C56 and C32 is not possible as C32 is already included. Wait, no, in this scenario, I&#x27;m only removing C38, so C32 is still in the proposal. So perhaps after removing C38, I can add C56.<br/><br/>Wait, no: if I only remove C38, I have 698 effort freed. Adding C56 which is 588, leaving 110. Then I could also add C32, but C32 is already in the proposal, so that&#x27;s not allowed. Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another small item not in the proposal, but looking at the list, the available items not in the proposal are A07, C03, C56, C08, C81.<br/><br/>So perhaps after removing C38, I can add C56 (588) and C81 (255). But 588+255=843&gt;698. So that would exceed the freed effort. Alternatively, only add C56 (588), which is less than 698. Then the effort used would be 2129-698+588=2019.<br/><br/>But 2019 is under 2307, so I could then have room for more. Let me see:<br/><br/>Effort after adding C56: 2019.<br/><br/>Remaining effort:2307-2019=288.<br/><br/>Looking for items not in the proposal and with effort ≤288. The items are A07 (356) too big, C03 (543), C08 (743), C56 is already added, C81 (255). So C81 can be added. Wait, 2019+255=2274, which is under 2307. So now the proposal would be:<br/><br/>Original minus C38, plus C56 and C81.<br/><br/>Effort: 2129-698=1431 +588=2019 +255=2274. Which is under 2307.<br/><br/>Importance: Original 2524 -65 (C38) +583 (C56)+508 (C81)=2524-65=2459 +583=3042 +508=3550.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s even better. So this seems like a significant improvement.<br/><br/>So this would mean my total importance jumps from 2524 to 3550, which is much better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I remove both C38 and C62, I can add C56 and C81 as before, which also gives a high total.<br/><br/>But perhaps if I can remove C38, add C56 and C81, and maybe also add another small item. Let&#x27;s see, effort after adding C56 and C81 is 2274, leaving 2307-2274=33 effort. Not enough for any other item, I think.<br/><br/>So perhaps the best option is to remove C38 and add C56 and C81, as that gives me a higher total importance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove both C38 and C62, and add C56 and C03. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>C56:588, C03:543. Total effort:588+543=1131. We freed up 804 by removing C38 and C62, so after adding 1131, the total effort would be 2129-804=1325 +1131=2456, which is under 2307. Wait, 2456 is more than 2307, so that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>So maybe that&#x27;s not an option. Therefore, the better choice is to remove C38, add C56 and C81.<br/><br/>But I need to check the other items in the proposal. Are there other low-importance items I can replace?<br/><br/>In the proposal, the items are A03 (400), A83 (97), B38 (121), C00 (389), C10 (461), C32 (262), C38 (65), C62 (30), C76 (484), C98 (215).<br/><br/>From my perspective, C76 is quite important (484), but C38 and C62 are low. So maybe that&#x27;s the best place to make substitutions.<br/><br/>Another idea: perhaps remove A83 and C62, as they are low importance to me. Let&#x27;s calculate their effort: A83 is 80, C62 is 106. So total 186 freed. Then, with 186, can I add something else.<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items: C56 (588) too big, C08 (743) too big, C03 (543) too big, A07 (356) is 356, which is bigger than 186, so perhaps adding A07 isn&#x27;t possible unless combined with smaller items.<br/><br/>So maybe not useful. So perhaps better to focus on removing the two low-importance items and replacing them with higher ones.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a better combination entirely.<br/><br/>Wait, another approach: what is the total effort and the maximum I can use? 2307.<br/><br/>The current proposal uses 2129, leaving 2307-2129=178. Hmm, maybe I can find items not in the proposal that can be added within that 178.<br/><br/>Looking at the items not in the proposal: A07 (356), C56 (588), C03 (543), C08 (743), C81 (255). None of these are ≤178, so I can&#x27;t add any with the remaining effort.<br/><br/>So perhaps the initial proposal is already using most of the effort, but I can try to swap some lower importance items for higher ones by adjusting the selection.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, my options are:<br/><br/>1. Accept the proposal as is, which gives me 2524 importance.<br/><br/>2. Modify the proposal by removing low-importance items (C62 and C38) and adding higher ones (C56 and C81), increasing my total importance significantly.<br/><br/>Option 2 seems better, so I should probably reject the current proposal and argue that I can get a better deal by making substitutions.<br/><br/>So, in my response, I should reject the proposal and suggest a new one.<br/><br/>But wait, the rules say that I can only respond with Vorschlag, Ablehnung, Argument, Zustimmung, and I must use the exact formats. Also, my response must include at least one ARGUMENT.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I can respond with ABLEHNUNG: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;} and then provide an argument explaining why.<br/><br/>Then, I could make a new Vorschlag with the modified set.<br/><br/>But wait, I can only send one type per message. So I think I can send ABLEHNUNG along with ARGUMENT, and then in a separate message, send VORSCHLAG.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should send ABLEHNUNG first, arguing that I can get a better deal, and then in the next step, propose the new set.<br/><br/>But in the initial interaction, I should respond to the other player&#x27;s Vorschlag, so I can combine ABLEHNUNG with ARGUMENT, explaining that their proposal is not optimal for me, and then propose my own.<br/><br/>But the system&#x27;s example had separate lines, so perhaps I can send:<br/><br/>ABLEHNUNG: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;Der vorgeschlagene Deal nimmt zu wenig Rücksicht auf meine Wichtigkeiten. Durch das Entfernen von C38 und C62 und das Hinzufügen von C56 und C81 kann ich eine bessere Ausbeute erzielen.&quot;}<br/><br/>But I can&#x27;t make a Vorschlag in the same message as ABLEHNUNG. So perhaps I should send ABLEHNUNG and ARGUMENT, and then in the next move, send a Vorschlag. But since the interaction is sequential, I need to do it step by step.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the system allows sending Vorschlag and ARGUMENT in the same message? The rules say that each message must use the structured formats and include ARGUMENT at least once. So perhaps I can send ABLEHNUNG and ARGUMENT in one message, and then separately send Vorschlag in the next.<br/><br/>But in this case, the user is asking for the first response after receiving the other player&#x27;s Vorschlag, so perhaps I should respond with ABLEHNUNG and ARGUMENT, explaining the issue, and then proceed.<br/><br/>But perhaps it&#x27;s better to make a counteroffer directly.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player made a Vorschlag, and I can either accept it, reject it and argue, or make a new proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can respond with:<br/><br/>ABLEHNUNG: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;Der vorgeschlagene Deal berücksichtigt nicht ausreichend meine Wichtigkeiten. Ich schlage vor, C38 und C62 durch C56 und C81 zu ersetzen, um höhere Wichtigkeiten zu erreichen, ohne den Maximalaufwand zu überschreiten.&quot;}<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I should make a Vorschlag directly in this message, but the rules allow only one type per message, so I think I can only send either ABLEHNUNG or Vorschlag, but not both. Therefore, perhaps it&#x27;s better to send ABLEHNUNG with an argument, and then in the next message, send a Vorschlag.<br/><br/>But for the purposes of this exercise, perhaps I should provide both in the same message, but according to the rules, I can only send one type per message. So perhaps I should send ABLEHNUNG and ARGUMENT first.<br/><br/>But wait, perhaps I can&#x27;t because each message can only have one of the keywords. Therefore, I need to decide whether to accept, reject, or propose.<br/><br/>Given that, I think the best approach is to reject the current proposal and present an argument, then in a separate message, make a new proposal.<br/><br/>But the user is asking for the response to the initial Vorschlag, so perhaps I should combine ABLEHNUNG and ARGUMENT in one message, and in the next step, make a Vorschlag.<br/><br/>But given the system&#x27;s constraints, I think it&#x27;s better to respond with ABLEHNUNG and ARGUMENT now, and then proceed to make a Vorschlag.<br/><br/>So, my response would be:<br/><br/>ABLEHNUNG: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}<br/>ARGUMENT: {&quot;Der vorgeschlagene Deal berücksichtigt nicht ausreichend meine Wichtigkeiten. Insbesondere C38 und C62 sind für mich weniger wichtig, während andere Gegenstände wie C56 und C81 eine höhere Wichtigkeit haben und den Aufwand nicht übermäßig erhöhen. Durch diese Änderungen könnte ich eine bessere Ausbeute erzielen, ohne den Maximalaufwand zu überschreiten.&quot;}<br/><br/>Then, in a subsequent message, I would send a Vorschlag with the modified set.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I just received a counteroffer from the other player. Let me try to understand what they&#x27;re going for. They rejected my initial proposal, which included a bunch of items, and they mentioned that C38 and C62 aren&#x27;t that important to them. Instead, they&#x27;d prefer C56 and C81 because those are higher on their priority list. <br/><br/>Alright, first, I need to recall the constraints. The total effort can&#x27;t exceed 2307. Let me check the total effort of my initial proposal to see where I stand. <br/><br/>My proposal included: A03, A83, B38, C00, C10, C32, C38, C62, C76, C98. <br/>Adding up their efforts: 43 + 80 + 276 + 308 + 325 + 51 + 698 + 668 + 147 + 95. Hmm, that adds up to... wait, 43+80 is 123, +276=399, +308=707, +325=1032, +51=1083, +698=1781, +668=2449. Oh wait, but my initial argument said 2129? Did I miscalculate earlier? Oops, that&#x27;s a problem because 2449 is way above 2307. Did I add wrong? Let me double-check.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I messed up the items. Let me list each item&#x27;s effort:<br/><br/>- A03:43<br/>- A83:80<br/>- B38:276<br/>- C00:308<br/>- C10:325<br/>- C32:51<br/>- C38:698<br/>- C62:668<br/>- C76:147<br/>- C98:95<br/><br/>Adding up: 43+80=123, +276=399, +308=707, +325=1032, +51=1083, +698=1781, +668=2449, +147=2596, +95=2691. Oh no, that&#x27;s way over! That&#x27;s a mistake. I thought the total was 2129, but actually, it&#x27;s way higher. I must have miscalculated earlier. So my initial proposal is invalid because it exceeds the max effort. That&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>But the other player pointed out that C38 and C62 are low priority for them. They suggested including C56 and C81 instead. Let me check those:<br/><br/>C56 has an effort of 588, and C81 is 255. If I remove C38 (698) and C62 (668), that&#x27;s a total reduction of 1366. Adding C56 (588) and C81 (255) adds 843. So the net change would be -523 (1366 - 843), bringing the total down.<br/><br/>Let me recalculate the total effort after swapping:<br/><br/>Original total without C38 and C62: 2691 - 698 -668 = 1325<br/><br/>Adding C56 and C81: 1325 + 588 +255 = 2168. That&#x27;s under 2307. So the effort would be 2168, which is within the limit.<br/><br/>But wait, what about the importance for me? I need to maximize my own importance. Let me see:<br/><br/>In my initial proposal, C38 has a value of 583, and C62 has 668. If I remove them and add C56 (65) and C81 (97), that&#x27;s a big drop in my total value. 583+668=1251 lost, replaced by 65+97=162. That&#x27;s a significant loss for me. So I need to see if there&#x27;s a better way to include higher-value items for me while keeping the effort down.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can make a different trade-off. Perhaps instead of swapping both C38 and C62, just swap one of them. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>If I remove C62 (668) and add C56 (588) and C81 (255), the effort change is -668 +588+255 = 175. So net effort would be initial effort minus 668 plus 843, which is 2691 -668=2023 +843=2866. That&#x27;s way over. So that&#x27;s not good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C38 (698) and add C56 (588) and maybe another small item. Wait, but adding C56 and C81 reduces the effort by 698 -588 -255 = -155. So 2691 -155 = 2536, which is still over. Hmm.<br/><br/>Perhaps I need to remove both C38 and C62 and add C56 and C81. As before, that brings effort down to 2168, which is acceptable. But I lose 1251 in value and gain only 162. That&#x27;s a big loss. Maybe I can find a compromise.<br/><br/>Alternatively, what if I keep C38 and swap C62 for C56 and C81? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Current total without C62: 2691 -668=2023<br/><br/>Add C56 (588) + C81(255) = 843. So total becomes 2023 +843=2866, which is still too high.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove both C38 and C62 and add C56 and C81, as before, to get 2168 effort, but that&#x27;s a big loss in value for me.<br/><br/>Wait, but maybe I can find other items to include that are more valuable to me. Let me look at the other items. Let&#x27;s see what other high-value items I have that I didn&#x27;t include initially.<br/><br/>Looking at my importance:<br/><br/>- A03:262<br/>- A07:121<br/>- A83:508<br/>- B38:500<br/>- C00:389<br/>- C10:215<br/>- C32:400<br/>- C38:583<br/>- C56:65<br/>- C62:668<br/>- C76:138<br/>- C81:97<br/>- C98:461<br/><br/>So, in my initial proposal, I included A03, A83, B38, C00, C10, C32, C38, C62, C76, C98. That gives me a total importance of: 262+508+500+389+215+400+583+668+138+461. Let me add that up: 262+508=770, +500=1270, +389=1659, +215=1874, +400=2274, +583=2857, +668=3525, +138=3663, +461=4124.<br/><br/>If I swap C38 (583) and C62 (668) for C56 (65) and C81 (97), I lose 583+668=1251 and gain 65+97=162, so my total importance drops by 1089, which is a lot.<br/><br/>But the other player is pushing for including C56 and C81, which I think are lower value for me but higher for them. Maybe I can find a way to keep some of the high-value items and swap in a way that doesn&#x27;t hurt me too much.<br/><br/>Perhaps I can offer a different combination. Let me think: What if I remove C38 (698) and C62 (668), which are costly, and replace them with C56 (588) and maybe another item that&#x27;s not too costly but gives me some value.<br/><br/>Wait, but adding C56 and C81 already reduces the effort significantly. Maybe I can add another small item that the other player likes but doesn&#x27;t cost much. Let&#x27;s see. For example, C08 is 743, which is too much. C03 is 543, which is also too much. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps instead of C56 and C81, I can see if there&#x27;s another item that the other player values more. They didn&#x27;t mention other items, but I can assume they have their own priorities. Since I don&#x27;t know their exact values, I have to make educated guesses.<br/><br/>Maybe I can suggest a different set that includes C56 and C81 but keeps some of my high-value items. Let me try:<br/><br/>What if I remove C38 (698) and C62 (668), and add C56 (588) and C81 (255). Let&#x27;s check the effort:<br/><br/>Total effort after removal: 2691 - 698 -668 = 1325<br/><br/>Add 588 +255 = 843, so total effort 1325 +843=2168.<br/><br/>Now, my importance after removal: 4124 -583-668=2873<br/><br/>Adding C56 (65) and C81 (97) gives 2873 +65+97=3035. But wait, that can&#x27;t be right because I&#x27;m adding less importance. Wait no: I had 4124, minus 583 and 668, so 4124-583=3541, minus 668=2873. Then adding 65+97=162, total 2873+162=3035. So that&#x27;s less than the initial 4124.<br/><br/>But perhaps that&#x27;s the best I can do if the other player insists on including C56 and C81. Alternatively, maybe I can find another combination.<br/><br/>Wait, another approach: What if I remove only C62 (668) and replace it with C56 (588) and another item that the other player might like, say, C07 (356). Let me see:<br/><br/>Removing C62: 2691 -668=2023<br/><br/>Adding C56 (588) + C07 (356) = 944<br/><br/>Total effort: 2023 +944=2967, which is over 2307. So that doesn&#x27;t work.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C62 (668) and add just C56 (588) and C81 (255). Let me check:<br/><br/>Total effort after removing C62: 2691 -668=2023<br/><br/>Adding 588+255=843, total 2023+843=2866, which is still over 2307. Not good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove both C38 and C62 (total 1366) and add C56 (588) and C81 (255) along with another small item that&#x27;s maybe not too costly but gives me some value.<br/><br/>Wait, but I can&#x27;t add another item because then effort would go up. Let&#x27;s see, if I remove C38 and C62 (total 1366), add C56 and C81 (total 843), which gives me 2691-1366+843=2168, which is within limit.<br/><br/>But as before, the importance for me drops a lot. So maybe I need to propose a different set.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps include some items that are slightly over but within the limit by adjusting others. Let me try a different combination.<br/><br/>What if I include C08? It has high effort (743) but maybe high value for me? Wait, my value for C08 is 484. Let me check:<br/><br/>If I include C08 instead of some other items, but it&#x27;s a high effort. Probably not worth it.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I can suggest a different deal that includes C56 and C81 but keeps more of my high-value items. For example, remove only C38 and add C56 and C81.<br/><br/>Effort after removing C38: 2691 -698=1993<br/><br/>Adding C56 (588) + C81 (255)=843, total effort 1993 +843=2836, which is over 2307. So no.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s not possible. So perhaps the only way to include both C56 and C81 is to remove both C38 and C62.<br/><br/>So the effort becomes 2168, which is acceptable. My importance drops a lot, but maybe that&#x27;s the compromise.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can suggest a different combination that includes C56 and C81 but keeps one of my high-value items. For example, remove C62 (668) and add C56 (588) and C81 (255). That would leave me with C38 (698). Let me see:<br/><br/>Effort: 2691 -668=2023<br/><br/>Add 588 +255=843, total 2023+843=2866&gt;2307. Still over.<br/><br/>So that doesn&#x27;t work. Alternatively, remove both C38 and C62 (1366) and add C56 (588) + C81 (255) + something else small, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible without exceeding.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove just C62 and replace it with C56 and C81, but that would require also removing something else to make the effort fit.<br/><br/>But that seems complicated. Maybe the best approach is to accept that including C56 and C81 requires removing both C38 and C62, leading to a total effort of 2168, and proceed with that.<br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t want to give up too much, so maybe I can suggest a different set that includes one of those and some others. Let me think.<br/><br/>Another angle: Let me calculate the effort and importance of different combinations.<br/><br/>For me, the highest value items are C62 (668), C38 (583), B38 (500), A83 (508), C98 (461), C00 (389), C32 (400), and so on.<br/><br/>If I have to remove C38 and C62, that&#x27;s a big hit. Maybe there&#x27;s a way to keep one of them.<br/><br/>Let me see: Can I keep C62 and remove C38, then add C56 and C81?<br/><br/>Effort: 2691 (initial) -698 (C38) +588 (C56)+255 (C81) = 2691-698=1993 +843=2836. Over.<br/><br/>So no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, keep C38 and remove C62, adding C56 and C81.<br/><br/>Effort: 2691 -668 (C62) +588 +255=2691-668=2023 +843=2866. Also over.<br/><br/>So neither works. So the only way to include both is to remove both.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can include C56 and keep one of them. But as above, that doesn&#x27;t fit.<br/><br/>So perhaps I have to accept that including C56 and C81 means losing both C38 and C62, leading to a lower total importance for me.<br/><br/>But maybe the other player is flexible. Perhaps I can offer a compromise that includes C56 but not C81, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Let me try: Remove C62 (668) and add C56 (588). So effort change: -668 +588 = -80. New total effort: 2691 -80=2611, which is still over 2307. So I need to remove more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C62 (668) and add C56 (588) and remove another item, say, C32 (51). Then, total change: -668 +588= -80, and then -51, so total change -131, making effort 2691-131=2560, still over. Need more reduction.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C62 (668) and C10 (325). So total removed: 668+325=993, add C56 (588) and C81 (255). So effort change: -993 +843= -150. New total effort: 2691-150=2541, still over.<br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe I can remove more items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C62 (668), C10 (325), and C76 (147). Total removed: 668+325+147=1140. Add C56 (588) and C81 (255). So effort change: -1140 +843= -297. Total effort: 2691-297=2394, still over by 87.<br/><br/>Close. Maybe remove another small item. Remove C76 (147) and C10 (325), so total removed 472, plus C62 (668)= total 1140. Add C56 and C81 (843), so net change -297. Effort 2394. Still over by 87.<br/><br/>If I remove another small item, say, C00 (308). That&#x27;s 1140+308=1448. Add C56, C81, which is 843. Net change: -605. New effort 2691-605=2086, which is within limit. But that would mean removing C00 as well, which has a value of 389 for me. So importance loss: 668 (C62) +325 (C10) +147 (C76) +308 (C00)=1448, but adding C56 and C81=843. Wait, no, I&#x27;m getting confused. <br/><br/>Wait, the items removed are C62, C10, C76, C00. Their efforts sum to 668+325+147+308=1448. The items added are C56 and C81, totaling 588+255=843. So net effort reduction is 1448-843=605, leading to 2691-605=2086.<br/><br/>In terms of importance, the removed items&#x27; value for me is: C62=668, C10=215, C76=138, C00=389. Total loss: 668+215+138+389=1410. Added items: C56=65, C81=97. Total gain:162. So net loss: 1248. That&#x27;s a big hit.<br/><br/>But maybe that&#x27;s the only way to fit their priorities. Alternatively, is there a better combination?<br/><br/>Alternatively, what if I remove C38 (698) and C62 (668), and add C56 (588) and C81 (255). As previously calculated, effort becomes 2168, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>In this case, my total value drops by 583+668=1251, adding 65+97=162, net loss 1089. That&#x27;s worse than the previous option.<br/><br/>So perhaps the earlier option of removing C62, C10, C76, C00, and adding C56 and C81, leading to a total effort of 2086, is better in terms of effort, but I lose more value. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can suggest keeping some other items. Let me see.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can propose a different set that includes C56 and C81 without removing both C38 and C62. Let me think: If I remove some lower-value items for me but higher effort, I might be able to accommodate.<br/><br/>For example, what if I remove C10 (effort 325) and C76 (147), which are lower importance for me, and add C56 (588) and C81 (255). Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Effort after removal: 2691 -325 -147=2219<br/><br/>Add 588 +255=843, total effort: 2219 +843=3062&gt;2307. Still over.<br/><br/>Not good. Alternatively, remove more items. Remove C10, C76, and C00 (308). Their total effort: 325+147+308=780.<br/><br/>Add C56 and C81: 588+255=843. So net change: -780 +843=+63. Effort becomes 2691+63=2754&gt;2307. Still over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C10, C76, C00, C32 (51). Total removed: 325+147+308+51=831<br/><br/>Add C56 (588) and C81 (255): 843<br/><br/>Net change: -831 +843=+12. Effort: 2691+12=2703&gt;2307.<br/><br/>Still over. Hmm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C10 (325), C76 (147), C00 (308), C32 (51), and C03 (30). Total removed: 325+147+308+51+30=861<br/><br/>Add C56 (588) and C81 (255): 843<br/><br/>Net change: -861 +843=-18. Effort: 2691-18=2673&gt;2307.<br/><br/>Still over. I need to remove more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove more high-effort items. Maybe C38 (698) and some smaller ones.<br/><br/>Wait, if I remove C38 (698), C10 (325), C76 (147), that&#x27;s total 1170.<br/><br/>Add C56 (588) and C81 (255): 843<br/><br/>Net change: -1170 +843=-327. Effort: 2691-327=2364&gt;2307. Still over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C38 (698), C62 (668), then add C56 (588) and C81 (255). As before, that brings effort to 2168, which is under. But my value drops a lot.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can remove C38 and C62, add C56 and C81, and also remove some smaller items to add more of my high-value items, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible without exceeding the effort.<br/><br/>This is getting complicated. Maybe I should just accept that including C56 and C81 requires me to lose both C38 and C62, resulting in a total effort of 2168, which is within limit, even though it hurts my total value.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player is open to including some of my high-value items if I include C56 and C81. Maybe I can propose a different set that includes both but keeps some of my high-value items.<br/><br/>Wait, another idea: Perhaps I can include C56 and C81 in the deal but also include other items that the other player might value more, allowing me to keep some of my high-value items.<br/><br/>But without knowing their priorities, it&#x27;s hard to say. Maybe I can suggest a compromise.<br/><br/>Let me try to create a new proposal that includes C56 and C81 while keeping some of my high-value items. Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>Include C56 and C81, and remove some of my lower priority items to make room.<br/><br/>What if I remove C10 (effort 325) and C76 (147), which are lower on my list, and add C56 and C81.<br/><br/>Effort after removal: 2691 -325 -147=2219<br/><br/>Add 588+255=843, so total 2219+843=3062&gt;2307. Still over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove more: Also remove C32 (51). So effort after removal: 2219 -51=2168, adding 588+255=843, total 2168+843=3011. No, that&#x27;s too high.<br/><br/>Wait, no, I think I&#x27;m confusing. If I remove C10 and C76, and C32, that&#x27;s 325+147+51=523. So effort after removal: 2691-523=2168<br/><br/>Adding C56 and C81: 2168 +588+255=3011, which is way over. No, that doesn&#x27;t make sense.<br/><br/>Wait, no, I think I&#x27;m making a mistake here. If I remove items, the effort is subtracted, and adding items is added. So removing C10, C76, C32: total removed effort 325+147+51=523, so remaining effort 2691-523=2168<br/><br/>Then adding C56 and C81: 588+255=843, so total effort 2168 +843=3011. Which is way over. So that doesn&#x27;t help.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can remove more items. Let me see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C38 (698) and C62 (668), add C56 (588) and C81 (255). As before, effort 2168.<br/><br/>But that&#x27;s a big hit on my value. Maybe I can at least add back some other item to compensate.<br/><br/>Wait, if I have 2168 effort left, can I add another small item? Let&#x27;s see, what&#x27;s the effort of other items:<br/><br/>Looking back, the efforts:<br/><br/>- A03:43<br/>- A07:356<br/>- A83:80<br/>- B38:276<br/>- C00:308<br/>- C10:325<br/>- C32:51<br/>- C38:698<br/>- C56:588<br/>- C62:668<br/>- C76:147<br/>- C81:255<br/>- C98:95<br/>- C03:543<br/>- C08:743<br/><br/>After removing C38 and C62, and adding C56 and C81, effort is 2168. Could I add another small item, say, A03 (43) and C98 (95). Wait, but I think I already included C98 in the initial proposal. Wait, no, in this scenario, I&#x27;ve removed C38 and C62, but what&#x27;s in the new proposal? Let me clarify.<br/><br/>Wait, in the initial proposal, I had A03, A83, B38, C00, C10, C32, C38, C62, C76, C98. After removing C38 and C62, I&#x27;m left with A03, A83, B38, C00, C10, C32, C76, C98. Then I add C56 and C81. Now, with effort 2168, but I have included all of these except C38 and C62, plus C56 and C81.<br/><br/>Wait, but let me recalculate the effort:<br/><br/>A03:43, A83:80, B38:276, C00:308, C10:325, C32:51, C56:588, C76:147, C81:255, C98:95.<br/><br/>Adding up:43+80=123, +276=399, +308=707, +325=1032, +51=1083, +588=1671, +147=1818, +255=2073, +95=2168.<br/><br/>Yes, that works. So the importance for me would be:<br/><br/>A03:262, A83:508, B38:500, C00:389, C10:215, C32:400, C56:65, C76:138, C81:97, C98:461.<br/><br/>Adding these:262+508=770, +500=1270, +389=1659, +215=1874, +400=2274, +65=2339, +138=2477, +97=2574, +461=3035.<br/><br/>So total importance 3035, compared to initial 4124. It&#x27;s less, but maybe that&#x27;s necessary to reach an agreement.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to include some other high-value items for me. Let me see if there&#x27;s a way to include either C38 or C62 without overshooting the effort.<br/><br/>Wait, if I remove C62 (668) and add C56 (588) and C81 (255), the effort change is -668 +843=+175. So total effort becomes 2691+175=2866, which is over. So that doesn&#x27;t work.<br/><br/>But if I remove both C38 and C62, and add C56 and C81, the effort is 2168, which is under, but my value drops a lot.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player is willing to accept a deal that doesn&#x27;t include both C56 and C81 but includes one of them. Let me consider that.<br/><br/>If I include only C56 (588) and not C81, what can I do? Removing C62 (668), adding C56 (588): effort change -80. So total effort 2691-80=2611&gt;2307. Still over. Need more reduction.<br/><br/>Remove C62 (668) and C32 (51), add C56 (588). Effort change: -668-51= -719 +588= -131. Total effort 2691-131=2560&gt;2307. Still over.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C62, C32, and C10 (325): total removed 668+51+325=1044, add C56 (588). Effort change -1044+588=-456. Total 2691-456=2235, which is within 2307.<br/><br/>In this case, my importance would be:<br/><br/>Original:4124 -668 (C62) -51 (C32) -325 (C10)=4124 -1044=3080, adding C56=65. So 3080+65=3145.<br/><br/>Is this better? The total effort is 2235, which is under 2307, and my importance is 3145, which is better than the 3035 when adding both C56 and C81.<br/><br/>But does this meet the other player&#x27;s demands? They wanted C56 and C81. If I include only C56 and exclude C81, maybe they aren&#x27;t happy. But I can argue that this is a better balance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can suggest including C81 and C56, but only after making other adjustments.<br/><br/>This is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should just accept that including both requires a significant drop in my value and proceed. Or, perhaps I can try to negotiate further by offering a different combination.<br/><br/>Another approach: Let me calculate the marginal gain per effort for my importance. Maybe prioritize items that give me more value per effort.<br/><br/>For each item, value per effort:<br/><br/>A03:262/43≈6.1<br/>A07:121/356≈0.34<br/>A83:508/80≈6.35<br/>B38:500/276≈1.81<br/>C00:389/308≈1.26<br/>C10:215/325≈0.66<br/>C32:400/51≈7.84<br/>C38:583/698≈0.83<br/>C56:65/588≈0.11<br/>C62:668/668=1.0<br/>C76:138/147≈0.94<br/>C81:97/255≈0.38<br/>C98:461/95≈4.85<br/>C03:30/543≈0.055<br/>C08:484/743≈0.652<br/>C62:668/668=1.0<br/><br/>So, highest value per effort are:<br/><br/>C32:7.84<br/>A83:6.35<br/>A03:6.1<br/>C98:4.85<br/>B38:1.81<br/>C62:1.0<br/>C76:0.94<br/>C38:0.83<br/>C00:1.26<br/>Others are lower.<br/><br/>So, prioritizing these, I should aim to include items with higher value per effort.<br/><br/>But in the initial proposal, I included most of the high ones except C98, which I included. Wait, yes, I included C98.<br/><br/>So perhaps in any negotiation, I should prioritize keeping the items with high value per effort and see if the other player can accept that.<br/><br/>But since they are pushing for C56 and C81, which are low on my list, I have to decide whether to compromise.<br/><br/>Another idea: Perhaps I can offer to include one of their desired items and exclude one of mine that&#x27;s high effort.<br/><br/>For example, include C56 (588) and exclude C38 (698). Effort change: -698 +588=-110. So total effort 2691-110=2581&gt;2307. Still need to reduce.<br/><br/>Alternatively, include C56 and exclude C62 (668). Effort change: -668 +588=-80. So 2691-80=2611&gt;2307.<br/><br/>Still need to reduce by 304. So perhaps also exclude C10 (325). Then effort change: -668-325= -993 +588= -405. Total effort 2691-405=2286, which is under 2307. <br/><br/>In this case, my importance would be: original 4124 -668 (C62) -325 (C10) =4124 -993=3131, adding C56=65. Total 3131+65=3196.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s better than the previous 3035. So maybe this is a better compromise.<br/><br/>Let me check:<br/><br/>Items included: A03, A83, B38, C00, C32, C38, C56, C76, C98. Plus, added C56.<br/><br/>Effort:43+80+276+308+51+698+588+147+95= Let&#x27;s calculate:<br/><br/>43+80=123, +276=399, +308=707, +51=758, +698=1456, +588=2044, +147=2191, +95=2286.<br/><br/>Yes, that&#x27;s under 2307.<br/><br/>Importance:262+508+500+389+400+583+65+138+461= <br/><br/>262+508=770, +500=1270, +389=1659, +400=2059, +583=2642, +65=2707, +138=2845, +461=3306.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s much better than the previous 3035.<br/><br/>So, the new proposal would include {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}.<br/><br/>Wait, but in this proposal, I included C38 but not C62. Let me confirm:<br/><br/>A03, A83, B38, C00, C32, C38, C56, C76, C98.<br/><br/>Effort:43+80+276+308+51+698+588+147+95=2286.<br/><br/>Importance:262+508+500+389+400+583+65+138+461=3306.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s a good balance. I included C56, which the other player wanted, while keeping C38, which is high for me, and excluding C62, which is high effort and maybe low for the other player.<br/><br/>This seems like a better compromise.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, so I just received the user&#x27;s response in this negotiation game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to break this down step by step.<br/><br/>First, I look at the history. The user initially proposed a deal that included a bunch of items: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}. The total cost of those items was 2129, which is under the 2307 limit. I rejected their offer, arguing that some of the items like C38 and C62 aren&#x27;t that important to me, whereas items like C56 and C81 are much more valuable. I suggested swapping those to get a better deal for myself.<br/><br/>Now, the user has come back with a new proposal: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}. They calculated the total cost as 2286, which is still under the limit. Their argument is that this new selection addresses my concerns by including C56 while keeping many of their high-priority items. So they think it&#x27;s a balanced deal that considers both parties.<br/><br/>Let me check the costs and my priorities:<br/><br/>- The removed items from their first offer are C10, C62, and they added C56.<br/>- C10&#x27;s cost is 325 and mine is 461. So losing C10 frees up 325.<br/>- C62&#x27;s cost is 106, but my priority is only 30 for C62, so getting rid of it is good for me.<br/>- Adding C56 with a cost of 588, which is a big chunk, but my priority is 583, which is really high.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the total cost now:<br/><br/>A03:43, A83:80, B38:276, C00:308, C32:51, C38:698, C56:588, C76:147, C98:95.<br/><br/>Adding these up: 43 +80=123, +276=399, +308=707, +51=758, +698=1456, +588=2044, +147=2191, +95=2286. Yep, that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Now, considering my priorities:<br/><br/>A03 is 400, A83 is 97, B38 is 121, C00 is 389, C32 is 262, C38 is 65, C56 is 583, C76 is 484, C98 is 215.<br/><br/>Adding up my values: 400 +97=497 +121=618 +389=1007 +262=1269 +65=1334 +583=1917 +484=2401 +215=2616.<br/><br/>So the total value I get from this deal is 2616.<br/><br/>In my rejected offer, if I had countered with swapping in C56 and C81 and out C38 and C62, let&#x27;s see what that would look like.<br/><br/>Removing C38 (698 cost, 65 value) and C62 (106 cost, 30 value) frees up 804 cost. Adding C56 (588) and C81 (255), which total 843. That would go over by 39, which isn&#x27;t allowed. Alternatively, maybe I can adjust differently.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can see if removing something else might allow me to include both C56 and C81.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I should evaluate if the current offer is acceptable or if I can push for more.<br/><br/>The current offer gives me 2616. If I could include C81 (255 cost, 508 value) by removing something else, that would be better. For instance, if I remove C38 (698 cost, 65 value) and add C56 (588) and C81 (255). But wait, that&#x27;s adding 588+255=843, and I removed 698, so net gain is 145, leading to 2286 +145=2431, which is over the limit. Not possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe replace C38 and another lower value item.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps if I remove C00 (308, 389) and add C56 (588) and C81 (255), net cost is 588+255 -308= 535, making total cost increase by 535 from 2286 to 2821, which is way over.<br/><br/>Hmm, not good. Alternatively, can I swap C56 for something else that I want more?<br/><br/>Wait, maybe instead of C32 (51 cost, 262 value), which is in the deal, perhaps I can swap C32 with C10 (325 cost, 461 value). But the user didn&#x27;t include C10. So in the new proposal, they removed C10. So if I can get C10 in, that&#x27;s 461 value for me, which is higher than C32 and C62 combined.<br/><br/>Wait, perhaps I can propose another swap.<br/><br/>Let me think about the cost and value.<br/><br/>In the current deal, they have C32 (51) in, but I have more value in C10 and C56. So if I can swap C32 for C10, that would help me. But that increases the cost by 325 -51= 274. The current total is 2286, adding 274 would make it 2560, which is still under 2307? No, 2560 &gt;2307. That&#x27;s over. Not allowed.<br/><br/>So maybe I need to find items to remove to compensate.<br/><br/>If I add C10 (325) and remove C32 (51) and perhaps another low-cost item. For example, remove C32 (51) and C10 isn&#x27;t in yet, but trying to add C10, maybe remove something else.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I can think of a different approach. Let&#x27;s look at the items included:<br/><br/>Included items and their cost and my value:<br/><br/>A03:43, 400<br/><br/>A83:80,97<br/><br/>B38:276,121<br/><br/>C00:308,389<br/><br/>C32:51,262<br/><br/>C38:698,65<br/><br/>C56:588,583<br/><br/>C76:147,484<br/><br/>C98:95,215<br/><br/>Total cost:2286<br/><br/>Total value:2616<br/><br/>If I could swap out C38 (which is low value for me) and perhaps another item to get C56 and C81, but as I saw earlier, that might not work due to cost.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose to add C81 by removing other lower value items.<br/><br/>Looking at the current deal, which items have the lowest value per cost?<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>A03:43 cost, 400 value -&gt; ~9.3 per unit<br/><br/>A83:80 cost,97 -&gt; ~1.21<br/><br/>B38:276,121 -&gt; ~0.438<br/><br/>C00:308,389 -&gt; ~1.26<br/><br/>C32:51,262 -&gt; ~5.14<br/><br/>C38:698,65 -&gt; ~0.093<br/><br/>C56:588,583 -&gt; ~1.00<br/><br/>C76:147,484 -&gt; ~3.30<br/><br/>C98:95,215 -&gt; ~2.26<br/><br/>So the worst are C38 (0.093) and B38 (0.438), followed by C00 (1.26).<br/><br/>So perhaps I can remove C38 (698 cost, 65 value) and maybe B38 (276 cost, 121 value) to free up 698+276=974 cost. Then I can add C81 (255,508) and maybe others.<br/><br/>With 974 cost available, I could add C81 (255) and then what else? Maybe C10 (325,461). 255+325=580, which is under 974.<br/><br/>So if I remove B38 and C38, and add C81 and C10.<br/><br/>So new deal would be:<br/><br/>A03, A83, C00, C32, C56, C76, C98, C10, C81.<br/><br/>Let me calculate the cost:<br/><br/>A03:43, A83:80, C00:308, C32:51, C56:588, C76:147, C98:95, C10:325, C81:255.<br/><br/>Adding these:43+80=123+308=431+51=482+588=1070+147=1217+95=1312+325=1637+255=1892.<br/><br/>Wait, that seems too low compared to before. Wait, let me check again:<br/><br/>Wait, the original deal is 2286 without C38, B38, C10, C81.<br/><br/>Wait, I think I&#x27;m getting confused. Let me recalculate.<br/><br/>If I remove B38 (276) and C38 (698), that&#x27;s 276+698=974.<br/><br/>If I add C10 (325) and C81 (255), that&#x27;s 325+255=580.<br/><br/>So the new total cost would be 2286 - 974 +580 = 2286 - 974=1312 +580=1892, which is way under 2307.<br/><br/>But that might leave me with more flexibility.<br/><br/>But let me check my value:<br/><br/>Old value without B38 and C38: 2616 -121 -65=2430.<br/><br/>Adding C10 (461) and C81 (508): 2430 +461+508=2430+969=3399.<br/><br/>So value increases from 2616 to 3399, which is a significant gain.<br/><br/>But the cost drops to 1892, so there&#x27;s room for more.<br/><br/>But perhaps I can include another item.<br/><br/>What else is left? C08:743, C62:106.<br/><br/>If I add C08 (743): 1892+743=2635, still under 2307? No, 2635 &gt;2307. So can&#x27;t add C08.<br/><br/>What about C62:106. 1892+106=1998, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>But C62&#x27;s value to me is only 30, so not worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can add C98 is already in, so maybe that&#x27;s the best.<br/><br/>Wait, let me re-express this. The new deal would be A03, A83, C00, C32, C56, C76, C98, C10, C81. That&#x27;s 9 items, which seems a lot, but maybe it&#x27;s possible.<br/><br/>But wait, the user&#x27;s last offer included 9 items as well. So perhaps this new proposal is acceptable.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose this as a Vorschlag, but let me check if the cost is correct.<br/><br/>Wait, A03:43, A83:80, C00:308, C32:51, C56:588, C76:147, C98:95, C10:325, C81:255.<br/><br/>Adding these up step by step:<br/><br/>43 +80 = 123<br/><br/>123 +308=431<br/><br/>431 +51=482<br/><br/>482 +588=1070<br/><br/>1070 +147=1217<br/><br/>1217 +95=1312<br/><br/>1312 +325=1637<br/><br/>1637 +255=1892.<br/><br/>Yes, 1892 total. That leaves us with 2307-1892=415 unused.<br/><br/>But maybe I can see if I can add more high-value items within the limit.<br/><br/>Looking at the remaining items: C62 (106,30), C08 (743,138).<br/><br/>If I add C62: total becomes 1892+106=1998, still under 2307. But my value only increases by 30.<br/><br/>Alternatively, C08: cost 743, value 138. 1892+743=2635&gt;2307, so no.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps instead of adding C10, I can add something else.<br/><br/>Wait, if I only add C81, then I would have:<br/><br/>1892 -325 (C10) +0, but I already removed C10. Wait, maybe I&#x27;m complicating.<br/><br/>Perhaps it&#x27;s better to see what&#x27;s best for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the deal to include C56, C81, and remove lower value items.<br/><br/>But I think the user is trying to balance both parties. Maybe I can negotiate further.<br/><br/>In their last argument, they said their proposal includes C56 and keeps many of their important items.<br/><br/>So perhaps I should consider whether their proposal is the best I can get, given that they included C56.<br/><br/>But wait, the current proposal has C56, but not C81. So perhaps I can push to include both C56 and C81 by removing some lower priority items for me.<br/><br/>But as I saw earlier, swapping C38 and B38 for C56 and C81 would free up a lot of cost, allowing me to add those two and maybe another item.<br/><br/>Wait, but the cost after adding C56 and C81 would be 2286 - C38(698) - B38(276) + C56(588) + C81(255). So total change: 2286 - 974 + 843 = 2286 - 131 = 2155.<br/><br/>Wait, 698+276=974, adding 588+255=843. So 974-843=131. So total cost would be 2286 -131=2155, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>So the total cost would be 2155, which leaves 2307-2155=152.<br/><br/>With 152 left, could I add another item? The remaining items are C10 (325), which is too big, or C62 (106). 106 is within the remaining. But C62 only adds 30 value. So perhaps it&#x27;s not worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can add C10 and remove something else to make room.<br/><br/>If I remove C00 (308) and add C10 (325), the cost change is +17. So total cost becomes 2155 +17=2172. Then I have 2307-2172=135 left. Could I add C62? 106, total becomes 2172+106=2278, which is under 2307. So the deal would be:<br/><br/>A03, A83, C10, C32, C56, C76, C98, C81, C62.<br/><br/>But my value would be 400(A03)+97(A83)+461(C10)+262(C32)+583(C56)+484(C76)+215(C98)+508(C81)+30(C62)= let&#x27;s add:<br/><br/>400+97=497 +461=958 +262=1220 +583=1803 +484=2287 +215=2502 +508=3010 +30=3040.<br/><br/>So that&#x27;s a high value for me, but is it feasible?<br/><br/>Let me check the cost:<br/><br/>A03:43, A83:80, C10:325, C32:51, C56:588, C76:147, C98:95, C81:255, C62:106.<br/><br/>Adding them:43+80=123 +325=448 +51=499 +588=1087 +147=1234 +95=1329 +255=1584 +106=1690.<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s only 1690, which is way under. Because we removed C00 (308) and B38 (276) and C38 (698), so we had a cost reduction of 308+276+698=1282. Then adding C10 (325), C56 (588), C81 (255), and C62 (106). That&#x27;s 325+588+255+106=1274. So net cost change: -1282 +1274= -8. So total cost would be 2286 -8=2278, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>So 2278 is the total cost, which is acceptable.<br/><br/>But does this make sense? Because this is a better deal for me, but the user might not accept it because it removes B38 and C38 which are probably high value for them.<br/><br/>I think I need to consider the user&#x27;s perspective. They included C56, which was my request, but perhaps they priority on B38 and C38 is high. So if I remove B38 and C38, which are important to them, they might not accept the deal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can find a middle ground where I get both C56 and C81, and only remove one low-priority item for me but high for them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to analyze the potential deals and their values, and then decide whether to accept or continue negotiating.<br/><br/>Given that, the user&#x27;s current proposal is giving me 2616, which is good, but I could potentially get 3040, which is better. So I might want to try to see if that&#x27;s possible without hurting the user too much.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can try to swap one item. For example, remove C32 and add C81, but that would be a cost swap. C32 costs 51, C81 is 255, so net +204. The total cost would then be 2286 +204=2490&gt;2307, which is over. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, remove C00 (308) and add C10 (325), which is only +17 in cost. So 2286 +17=2303, which is within limit.<br/><br/>So the new deal would be:<br/><br/>A03, A83, B38, C10, C32, C38, C56, C76, C98.<br/><br/>But C10 is 325, cost 325, and C00 is 308. So 325-308=17, which is manageable.<br/><br/>So total cost becomes 2286 -308 +325=2286+17=2303.<br/><br/>Is that a better deal for me? Let&#x27;s see:<br/><br/>The items are A03:400, A83:97, B38:121, C10:461, C32:262, C38:65, C56:583, C76:484, C98:215.<br/><br/>Total value:400+97=497+121=618+461=1079+262=1341+65=1406+583=1989+484=2473+215=2688.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s better than the previous 2616, but not as good as the 3040.<br/><br/>But the cost is now 2303, which is just under the limit.<br/><br/>But does this make sense? I&#x27;m removing C00 (308,389) and adding C10 (325,461). So for me, it&#x27;s a gain in value (461-389=72), but the cost increases by 17.<br/><br/>But maybe this is a feasible step. So perhaps I can counter-propose this deal.<br/><br/>But in my previous message, I had already rejected the deal with A03, A83, B38, C00, C32, C38, C56, C76, C98.<br/><br/>So now, perhaps I can propose a modified deal where I swap C00 for C10, getting a higher value for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can argue for this and see if the user is willing.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, my options are:<br/><br/>1. Accept the user&#x27;s offer, getting 2616 value.<br/><br/>2. Attempt to modify the offer to include C10 and C81 by removing lower-priority items, but that might involve removing items that are important to the user, which could lead to rejection.<br/><br/>3. Propose a new deal that includes C10 and C56, trying to balance both parties.<br/><br/>I think the best approach is to propose a modified deal that includes C10 and C56, removing some items that are less important to me, to see if the user is willing to accept it, thereby maximizing my value without exceeding the cost limit.<br/><br/>I should frame my argument to highlight the benefits of the new proposal, emphasizing how it&#x27;s still balanced and within the budget, while also trying to appeal to the user&#x27;s priorities.<br/><br/>So, in my response, I can make a new Vorschlag (offer) that includes the desired items and argue the benefits, such as higher efficiency or better balanced interests.<br/></p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Negotiator) to Player 1 (Negotiator)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, so I&#x27;m trying to solve this collaborative negotiation problem where I have to reach an agreement with another player. The goal is to select a set of items without exceeding the maximum effort of 2307. Each of us has our own personal importance values for each item, but we don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s. <br/><br/>In the last message, the other player suggested an offer: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}. They argued that this selection optimizes the effort and considers higher importance for C10 over C00 for them, maintaining a good balance. The total effort is 2303, which is under 2307.<br/><br/>My previous suggestion was {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}, with a total effort of 2286. That was after they had rejected my initial offer, pointing out that C38 and C62 were less important to them and that C56 and C81 were more important.<br/><br/>So, first, I need to evaluate the current offer they&#x27;ve made. Let me look at the effort for each item they included:<br/><br/>- A03: 43<br/>- A83: 80<br/>- B38: 276<br/>- C10: 325<br/>- C32: 51<br/>- C38: 698<br/>- C56: 588<br/>- C76: 147<br/>- C98: 95<br/><br/>Let me add these up: <br/><br/>43 + 80 = 123; 123 + 276 = 399; +325 = 724; +51 = 775; +698 = 1473; +588 = 2061; +147 = 2208; +95 = 2303. Yep, that&#x27;s correct.<br/><br/>Now, looking at my own importance values for these items:<br/><br/>- A03: 262<br/>- A83: 508<br/>- B38: 500<br/>- C10: 215<br/>- C32: 400<br/>- C38: 583<br/>- C56: 65<br/>- C76: 138<br/>- C98: 461<br/><br/>Adding my total: 262 + 508 = 770; +500 = 1270; +215 = 1485; +400 = 1885; +583 = 2468; +65 = 2533; +138 = 2671; +461 = 3132. Hmm, that&#x27;s a high total for me.<br/><br/>But I need to consider if there&#x27;s a better balance where both parties are satisfied. Let me check if the other player included C56, which they wanted, but removed C00. Did that help them? Maybe C10 is more important to them.<br/><br/>I should see if swapping some items can benefit both. Maybe removing some lower importance items for me and adding others that are more important to the other player without increasing the effort too much.<br/><br/>Looking at the current selection, C56 has a low importance for me (65) but high effort (588). Maybe I can swap C56 with another item that&#x27;s more important to me but has lower effort. Let&#x27;s check the remaining items not included:<br/><br/>Possible items not in the current offer: C00 (effort 308, my importance 389), C62 (effort 106, my importance 668), C08 (743, ...), C81 (255, my importance 97). <br/><br/>Wait, C62 has high importance for me (668) and low effort (106). That seems ideal. If I can include C62 and remove C56, that would significantly increase my total.<br/><br/>But the other player had argued that C62 is less important for them, so maybe they wouldn&#x27;t mind giving it up. Let&#x27;s calculate the effort if we swap C56 (588) with C62 (106): 2303 - 588 + 106 = 2303 - 482 = 1821. That&#x27;s a big drop. Wait, that can&#x27;t be right because 588 - 106 is 482. So 2303 - 482 is 1821. Then I can add more items. But that&#x27;s not possible because we need to maintain the effort under 2307.<br/><br/>Wait, no, swapping one item for another doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean removing and adding, but replacing. So replacing C56 (588) with C62 (106) would free up 482 effort. That allows us to add other items.<br/><br/>But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps just adding C62 and removing C56. Let&#x27;s see: removing C56 (588) and adding C62 (106) would reduce the total effort by 482, which would leave us with 2303 - 482 = 1821. Then we have 2307 - 1821 = 486 effort left to allocate. Maybe we can add another high-importance item for me.<br/><br/>Looking for items with high importance for me and low effort. C00 has an effort of 308 and importance of 389, which is good. Let&#x27;s see if we can add that.<br/><br/>So the new set would be:<br/><br/>{&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;}<br/><br/>Wait, that&#x27;s 10 items. Let&#x27;s check the effort:<br/><br/>43 (A03) + 80 (A83) + 276 (B38) + 325 (C10) + 51 (C32) + 698 (C38) + 106 (C62) + 147 (C76) + 95 (C98) + 308 (C00).<br/><br/>Calculating step by step:<br/><br/>43+80=123; +276=399; +325=724; +51=775; +698=1473; +106=1579; +147=1726; +95=1821; +308=2129.<br/><br/>So the total effort is 2129, which is within the limit. Let&#x27;s check the importance for me:<br/><br/>262 (A03) + 508 (A83) + 500 (B38) + 215 (C10) + 400 (C32) + 583 (C38) + 668 (C62) + 138 (C76) + 461 (C98) + 389 (C00).<br/><br/>Adding these: 262+508=770; +500=1270; +215=1485; +400=1885; +583=2468; +668=3136; +138=3274; +461=3735; +389=4124.<br/><br/>This is a significant increase in my total importance. But I need to make sure the other player is okay with this. They might not want C00 because they might have it as less important. Alternatively, maybe it&#x27;s better to propose a different set that doesn&#x27;t remove C56 but adds C62, but that would require checking the effort.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if we can include C56, C62, and maybe exclude some other lower importance items for me.<br/><br/>Wait, but the effort might exceed. Let me try replacing C56 (588) with C62 (106) and C00 (308). Let&#x27;s see: 588 - 106 -308 = 174. So total effort would decrease by 174, allowing more items.<br/><br/>Wait, maybe I&#x27;m overcomplicating. Perhaps the best approach is to accept their offer because it&#x27;s a good balance, but I need to see if I can tweak it a bit more.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I accept their Vorschlag, the game ends. But I can respond with Zustimmung if I agree, but since I have a better alternative, perhaps I should make a new Vorschlag.<br/><br/>But first, I need to check if their current offer is acceptable. Their offer includes C56 (which they wanted) and C10 (more important to them than C00), and excludes C00 and C62. But for me, C62 is very important, and C00 is also high. So maybe I can suggest including C62 and C00 and removing C56 and C10.<br/><br/>But let&#x27;s calculate that. Replace C10 (325) and C56 (588) with C62 (106) and C00 (308). The effort change would be 325+588=913 replaced by 106+308=414, so a net reduction of 499. That&#x27;s a significant drop, so the total effort would be 2303 -913 +414 = 2303 -499 = 1804. Then I could add more items, but maybe I can include C08, but that&#x27;s 743, which is too much. Or maybe just have more items. Alternatively, perhaps this is not the best approach.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose a new offer that includes C62 instead of C56, and see if that&#x27;s acceptable. Let&#x27;s try.<br/><br/>New offer: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}<br/><br/>Let me check the effort: A03=43, A83=80, B38=276, C00=308, C10=325, C32=51, C38=698, C62=106, C76=147, C98=95.<br/><br/>Adding up: 43+80=123; +276=399; +308=707; +325=1032; +51=1083; +698=1781; +106=1887; +147=2034; +95=2129.<br/><br/>So effort is 2129, which is under 2307. Importance for me: A03=262, A83=508, B38=500, C00=389, C10=215, C32=400, C38=583, C62=668, C76=138, C98=461.<br/><br/>Total: 262+508=770; +500=1270; +389=1659; +215=1874; +400=2274; +583=2857; +668=3525; +138=3663; +461=4124.<br/><br/>This is better for me, but does the other player accept this? They might not like losing C56 and including C00, which they might have lower importance for. So maybe I should adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can offer to swap C10 with C00, keeping C56. So the new offer would be {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;} but that&#x27;s the same as before, but I think C10 is a higher effort than C00.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the effort for C10 is 325, and C00 is 308. So swapping C10 for C00 would reduce effort by 17, allowing me to perhaps include another small item. But not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can stick with their offer and Zustimmung accepting it, as it&#x27;s a good compromise. But given that I can get a better deal for myself by including C62, maybe I should make a new offer.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player&#x27;s current offer is {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C10&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;} with effort 2303. I can respond by making a new Vorschlag that includes C62 and C00, and excludes C10 and C56, but I need to check the effort.<br/><br/>Wait, replacing C10 (325) and C56 (588) with C00 (308) and C62 (106) would change effort by 308+106=414 vs 325+588=913, so effort reduces by 913-414=499. So new total effort would be 2303 -499=1804. Then I have 2307-1804=503 left. I could add another item, like C08 is too big (743), C03 (543), C81 (255). C81 has effort 255, which fits. So adding C81.<br/><br/>So new offer: {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;, &quot;C81&quot;}<br/><br/>Effort: 43+80=123; +276=399; +308=707; +51=758; +698=1456; +106=1562; +147=1709; +95=1804; +255=2059. Still under 2307. The importance for me would be:<br/><br/>A03=262, A83=508, B38=500, C00=389, C32=400, C38=583, C62=668, C76=138, C98=461, C81=97.<br/><br/>Total: 262+508=770; +500=1270; +389=1659; +400=2059; +583=2642; +668=3310; +138=3448; +461=3909; +97=4006. That&#x27;s much better for me, but I&#x27;m adding C81, which might not be too bad for the other player as it has lower effort but I don&#x27;t know their importance.<br/><br/>But wait, the other player might not want to include C00 and C62, so maybe they will reject this. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to find a middle ground.<br/><br/>Alternatively, since my main gains are from including C62 and C00, but that requires removing C10 and C56, which are important to the other player, perhaps a compromise is necessary.<br/><br/>Maybe I can include C56 and C62, but then effort would be too high. Let&#x27;s see: adding both would require effort 588 + 106 = 694, but in the current offer, the effort is 2303, so if I include both, I might have to remove other items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps I can propose a new Vorschlag that includes C62 and keeps C56, but removes another item. For example, remove C10 (325) and include C62 (106), so effort changes by 106-325=-219, allowing to add more.<br/><br/>So the new offer would be {&quot;A03&quot;, &quot;A83&quot;, &quot;B38&quot;, &quot;C00&quot;, &quot;C32&quot;, &quot;C38&quot;, &quot;C56&quot;, &quot;C62&quot;, &quot;C76&quot;, &quot;C98&quot;}. Effort would be previous 2303 -325 +106 +308 (if adding C00). Wait, no, in their offer, they included C10 instead of C00. So I need to check:<br/><br/>Original offer effort: 2303 includes C10=325, and not C00 and C62.<br/><br/>If I replace C10 with C00 and C62: C10 is 325, so removing it and adding C00=308 and C62=106 would change effort by 308+106=414, so 2303 -325 +414= 2303 +89=2392, which is over the limit. So that&#x27;s not possible.<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps the best I can do is to accept their offer, knowing that I could get more, but considering that pushing for more might lead them to reject and I might end up with nothing. Alternatively, I can make a new offer that includes C62 and see if they accept.<br/><br/>But perhaps it&#x27;s better to accept their offer to end the game with a decent deal. Alternatively, I can make a new offer that includes C62 and maybe swap out C10, but that might not keep effort within limits. Alternatively, I can accept their offer and end the game.<br/><br/>So, considering all that, I think it&#x27;s best to Zustimmung their offer because it&#x27;s a reasonable balance, and trying to push for more might risk the deal falling through.<br/></p>
