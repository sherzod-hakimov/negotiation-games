                    "content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this negotiation game. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.\n\nWe have two players, me and another, and we need to agree on a set of items to keep. Each item has a cost, and the total cost can't exceed 3207. The goal for each player is to maximize their own importance values from the selected items, but we don't know each other's importance ratings. \n\nFirst, I need to list out all the items with their costs and my importance values. Let me create two lists: one for costs and one for my values.\n\nItems: C41, C15, C28, C48, B78, A75, A60, B05, A56, B66, C60, B49, A35, A93, B10.\n\nCosts: \nC41:67, C15:45, C28:308, C48:835, B78:819, A75:667, A60:547, B05:322, A56:428, B66:306, C60:327, B49:362, A35:280, A93:334, B10:767.\n\nMy Values:\nC41:138, C15:583, C28:822, C48:783, B78:65, A75:262, A60:121, B05:508, A56:780, B66:461, C60:484, B49:668, A35:389, A93:808, B10:215.\n\nI think the first step is to sort the items based on the value-to-cost ratio for me. That way, I can prioritize items that give me the most value per unit cost. This should help in maximizing my total value without exceeding the budget.\n\nCalculating the ratio (Value/Cost):\n\n- C41: 138/67 \u2248 2.06\n- C15: 583/45 \u2248 12.96\n- C28: 822/308 \u2248 2.67\n- C48: 783/835 \u2248 0.94\n- B78: 65/819 \u2248 0.079\n- A75: 262/667 \u2248 0.393\n- A60: 121/547 \u2248 0.221\n- B05: 508/322 \u2248 1.576\n- A56: 780/428 \u2248 1.823\n- B66: 461/306 \u2248 1.507\n- C60: 484/327 \u2248 1.479\n- B49: 668/362 \u2248 1.846\n- A35: 389/280 \u2248 1.389\n- A93: 808/334 \u2248 2.42\n- B10: 215/767 \u2248 0.280\n\nWow, C15 has the highest ratio by far at around 12.96. That's way higher than the others. So C15 is a must-have. After that, A93 is next with 2.42, then C28 at 2.67, but wait, C28 is higher than A93. Wait, no, 2.67 is higher than 2.42. So order would be C15, C28, A93, then C41, etc.\n\nWait, let me list them in order:\n\n1. C15 (12.96)\n2. C28 (2.67)\n3. A93 (2.42)\n4. C41 (2.06)\n5. B49 (1.846)\n6. A56 (1.823)\n7. B05 (1.576)\n8. B66 (1.507)\n9. C60 (1.479)\n10. A35 (1.389)\n11. C48 (0.94)\n12. B10 (0.280)\n13. A60 (0.221)\n14. A75 (0.393)\n15. B78 (0.079)\n\nWait, that ordering doesn't seem right because some higher ratios are after lower ones. Let me correct that. The correct order should be from highest to lowest ratio:\n\n1. C15 (12.96)\n2. C28 (2.67)\n3. A93 (2.42)\n4. C41 (2.06)\n5. B49 (1.846)\n6. A56 (1.823)\n7. B05 (1.576)\n8. B66 (1.507)\n9. C60 (1.479)\n10. A35 (1.389)\n11. C48 (0.94)\n12. A75 (0.393)\n13. B10 (0.280)\n14. A60 (0.221)\n15. B78 (0.079)\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. B05 is 1.576, which is higher than B66 (1.507). So the correct order after the top 4 would be:\n\n5. B49 (1.846)\n6. A56 (1.823)\n7. B05 (1.576)\n8. B66 (1.507)\n9. C60 (1.479)\n10. A35 (1.389)\n11. C48 (0.94)\n12. A75 (0.393)\n13. B10 (0.280)\n14. A60 (0.221)\n15. B78 (0.079)\n\nWait, but where is C48? It's 0.94, which is lower than A93 and others. Okay.\n\nNow, the idea is to select items in this order until we reach the budget. But since this is a negotiation, the other player might have different priorities. But since I don't know their values, I need to make an initial offer that gets me the most value without exceeding 3207.\n\nLet me start by selecting C15 first. It's cost is 45. Then C28 is next at 308. So adding that gives 45+308=353. Then A93 is 334, which brings the total to 353+334=687. Next is C41 at 67, total 754. Then B49 at 362, total 754+362=1116. Then A56 at 428, total 1116+428=1544. Then B05 at 322, total 1544+322=1866. Then B66 at 306, total 1866+306=2172. Then C60 at 327, total 2172+327=2499. Next, A35 at 280, total 2499+280=2779. Then C48 at 835, which would take us to 2779+835=3614, which is over the budget. So can't take C48. Next, A75 at 667. Adding that to 2779 would be 2779+667=3446, also over. Then B10 at 767, way over. A60 is 547, which would bring it to 2779+547=3326, still over. A60's cost is 547, so maybe not. Hmm, so perhaps up to A35, total 2779. Remaining budget is 3207-2779=428. So maybe we can replace some lower-value items to include higher-value ones. Alternatively, perhaps I can take more items that fit within the budget.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to select items in order of their ratio until we reach the budget. Let me try that.\n\nStart with C15 (45). Remaining: 3162.\n\nAdd C28 (308): total 45+308=353. Remaining: 3207-353=2854.\n\nAdd A93 (334): total 353+334=687. Remaining: 3207-687=2520.\n\nAdd C41 (67): 754. Remaining: 2453.\n\nAdd B49 (362): 1116. Remaining: 2091.\n\nAdd A56 (428): 1544. Remaining: 1663.\n\nAdd B05 (322): 1866. Remaining: 1341.\n\nAdd B66 (306): 2172. Remaining: 1035.\n\nAdd C60 (327): 2499. Remaining: 708.\n\nAdd A35 (280): 2779. Remaining: 428.\n\nNow, 428 left. What's the next item? C48 is 835, which is too big. A75 is 667, too big. B10 is 767, too big. A60 is 547, too big. B05 is 322, but I have already included it. Wait, no, B05 is already in.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of A35, which costs 280 and gives 389, maybe I could swap it for a higher-value item that uses the remaining budget.\n\nBut 428 remaining. Let me see which items haven't been selected yet: C48 (835), A75 (667), B10 (767), A60 (547), B78 (819).\n\nLooking for items with cost less than 428. Let me check: A60 is 547, which is over. There's no other items left except those that are too expensive.\n\nSo perhaps A35 is the best we can do. So total value so far is 138 (C41) + 583 (C15) +822 (C28) +808 (A93) +668 (B49) +780 (A56) +508 (B05) +461 (B66) +484 (C60) +389 (A35).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n138 + 583 = 721\n\n721 +822=1543\n\n1543+808=2351\n\n2351+668=3019\n\n3019+780=3799\n\n3799+508=4307\n\n4307+461=4768\n\n4768+484=5252\n\n5252+389=5641.\n\nSo total value is 5641.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better combination. Let me consider whether swapping some items could give me a higher total.\n\nFor example, instead of including A35 (280 cost, 389 value), maybe I can include A60, which costs 547 but gives 121. But since 121 is much lower, that's not beneficial. Alternatively, perhaps not including some lower-ratio items earlier on to include higher ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps including A56 (428 cost, 780 value) is better than some other combinations. Wait, but in our current selection, we have A56 included.\n\nAlternatively, could I replace some items to fit in A75 (667 cost, 262 value) or B10 (767, 215). But those have lower ratios, so probably not worth it.\n\nAnother approach: Use a branch and bound or knapsack algorithm approach, but since I'm doing this manually, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe drop some lower-value items to fit in a higher-value one. For example, maybe exclude B66 (461 value, 306 cost) and include something else. Wait, but that would require the replacement item to have higher value per cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a combination that includes A93, C28, C15, B49, A56, B05, and then see if any other items can fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try including C48, which is 835 cost, 783 value. Its ratio is low, but maybe if I exclude some items with lower total value. Let me see.\n\nCurrent total cost: 2779, with value 5641.\n\nIf I remove A35 (280 cost, 389 value) and add C48 (835 cost, 783 value), the cost becomes 2779 -280 +835 = 3334, which is over the budget. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove more items to include C48. For example, remove A35 (280) and perhaps another item, say, C60 (327 cost, 484 value). Removing both would free up 280+327=607. Then adding C48 (835) would require 835, which is more than 607, so still not enough.\n\nAlternatively, remove B66 (306) and A35 (280), frees up 586. Adding C48 (835) is still more than that, so no.\n\nAlternatively, remove B66 and C60: 306+327=633. Adding C48 (835) would require 835-633=202 more. So I need to remove another 202. Maybe A35 is 280, but that's more than needed. Alternatively, perhaps A60 at 547, but that's too much. Hmm, this might not be the best path.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the initial selection.\n\nAlternatively, let's see: total cost so far is 2779, leaving 428. Maybe look for items with cost <=428 and see if swapping with lower-value items can increase total.\n\nLooking at the remaining items:\n\n- B05 is already included.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Let's list all the items not yet included:\n\nC48 (835), A75 (667), B10 (767), A60 (547), B78 (819). None of these are under 428, except maybe none. So no way to add more.\n\nTherefore, the initial selection is the best possible for me, giving a total value of 5641, with a total cost of 2779, leaving some budget unused.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can find a combination that uses the budget more efficiently. Let's check my current selection again:\n\nC15 (45), C28 (308), A93 (334), C41 (67), B49 (362), A56 (428), B05 (322), B66 (306), C60 (327), A35 (280). Let's sum up the costs:\n\n45+308=353\n\n+334=687\n\n+67=754\n\n+362=1116\n\n+428=1544\n\n+322=1866\n\n+306=2172\n\n+327=2499\n\n+280=2779.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTotal value:138+583+822+808+668+780+508+461+484+389.\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n\n138 +583 =721\n\n+822=1543\n\n+808=2351\n\n+668=3019\n\n+780=3799\n\n+508=4307\n\n+461=4768\n\n+484=5252\n\n+389=5641.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, if I can include A93, which is high-value, and C15, which is the highest ratio, then that's good. But maybe the opponent has different priorities.\n\nIn a negotiation, perhaps I should start with a somewhat generous offer, including some high-value items for both, or maybe start with a subset and see how the opponent reacts.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my value while considering possible overlaps. Alternatively, maybe start with a minimal set and see.\n\nBut in this thinking phase, as an initial proposal, perhaps I can suggest a set that includes my top items, and see if the opponent is willing to accept, or negotiate from there.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial proposal could be the set I have, but maybe include a few more items if possible. Wait, but I can't, because we're at 2779, and the budget is 3207.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to include A75 (667 cost, 262 value). Let's see, if I remove some lower-value items to include A75. For example, A75 costs 667, which is high, but perhaps replacing some items.\n\nBut looking at my current selection, the total cost is 2779. If I remove, say, B66 (306 cost) and C60 (327 cost), that's 633 total, and add A75 (667) and some other item. Wait, but 2779 -633=2146. Adding A75 (667) would leave 2146+667=2813, then I can add B66 (306), but that would make it 2813+306=3119, which is over the budget. Alternatively, just add A75 and see.\n\nSo 2779 -306 (B66) -327 (C60) +667 (A75) would be 2779-633+667= 2813. That leaves 3207-2813=394. Can I add anything else? Let's see, what's left: B10 is too big, C48 too big, etc. No, nothing else. So the total value would be 5641 minus 461 (B66) minus484 (C60) plus262 (A75). So 5641 -945 +262= 4958, which is worse. So not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove only B66 (461 value, 306 cost), and add A75 (262 value, 667 cost). The cost would increase by 667-306=361, so total cost becomes 2779+361=3140, which is under 3207. But the value would decrease by 461-262=199. So 5641-199=5442, which is worse. So not better.\n\nTherefore, the initial selection seems better.\n\nSo, I think my best initial proposal is the set as I have it, with total value 5641 and total cost 2779.\n\nBut in the game, I need to make a proposal, so I can suggest all those items. Alternatively, since the other player might not accept, perhaps make a smaller initial proposal and negotiate.\n\nBut to maximize my value, perhaps I should include as many high-value items as possible.\n\nSo the initial proposal would include: C15, C28, A93, C41, B49, A56, B05, B66, C60, A35.\n\nBut let me check the total cost again:\n\n45+308=353\n\n+334=687\n\n+67=754\n\n+362=1116\n\n+428=1544\n\n+322=1866\n\n+306=2172\n\n+327=2499\n\n+280=2779.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo my first move is to make this proposal, but in the game, perhaps I should present it and argue why it's a good deal.\n\nAlternatively, to make a better argument, I can include some other items that the opponent might value more, but since I don't know their values, it's tricky.\n\nBut perhaps I can argue based on costs and maybe the opponent's possible needs.\n\nWait, in the game, the users are supposed to only use the specified formats, so perhaps I should structure my responses accordingly, starting with a Vorschlag, including the items, and an argument.\n\nBut in this thinking phase, I'm just planning my approach.\n\nSo, my initial proposal would be to include these items, as they maximize my value without exceeding the budget. Now, in the game, I can present this as VORSCHLAG and argue that it's efficient.\n\nNow, considering the possible responses: the opponent might accept, reject, or counter-propose. I should be prepared to argue why this selection is optimal for both parties, or make adjustments if the opponent has other priorities.\n\nIn the game, after I make the proposal, I can use ARGUMENT to justify it, perhaps highlighting the high value-to-cost ratios or the total cost efficiency.\n\nI think that's a good starting point. Now, let's see how to present this in the required format.\n",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the opponent made a Vorschlag, which is a proposal, with a bunch of items. Their proposal is {'C15', 'C28', 'A93', 'C41', 'B49', 'A56', 'B05', 'B66', 'C60', 'A35'}. They argue that this combination maximizes their importance while keeping the total effort under the limit. From their perspective, these items have high importance for them and are relatively low in effort.\n\nBut I need to think about what's best for me. My goal is to maximize my own importance without exceeding the max effort of 3207. So, I should evaluate their proposal from my perspective.\n\nLet me list out the items in their proposal and see both the effort and my importance for each:\n\n- C15: Effort 45, My Wert 583\n- C28: Effort 308, My Wert 822\n- A93: Effort 334, My Wert 808\n- C41: Effort 67, My Wert 138\n- B49: Effort 362, My Wert 668\n- A56: Effort 428, My Wert 780\n- B05: Effort 322, My Wert 508\n- B66: Effort 306, My Wert 461\n- C60: Effort 327, My Wert 484\n- A35: Effort 280, My Wert 389\n\nNow, let me calculate the total effort for their proposal. Adding them up:\n\n45 + 308 = 353\n353 + 334 = 687\n687 + 67 = 754\n754 + 362 = 1116\n1116 + 428 = 1544\n1544 + 322 = 1866\n1866 + 306 = 2172\n2172 + 327 = 2499\n2499 + 280 = 2779\n\nTotal effort is 2779, which is well under 3207. So, their proposal is within the limit, but how does it benefit me?\n\nLet me sum up my Werte for each item:\n\n583 + 822 = 1405\n1405 + 808 = 2213\n2213 + 138 = 2351\n2351 + 668 = 3019\n3019 + 780 = 3799\n3799 + 508 = 4307\n4307 + 461 = 4768\n4768 + 484 = 5252\n5252 + 389 = 5641\n\nSo, their proposal gives me a total Wert of 5641. Now, is this the best I can get? Maybe not. I should check if I can swap some items to get higher Wert without exceeding effort.\n\nLooking at the remaining items not in their proposal: B78, A75, A60, C48, B10.\n\nLet me see their efforts and my Werte:\n\n- B78: Effort 819, Wert 65\n- A75: Effort 667, Wert 262\n- A60: Effort 547, Wert 121\n- C48: Effort 835, Wert 783\n- B10: Effort 767, Wert 215\n\nHmm. The opponent didn't include C48, which has a high Wert for me (783) but also a high effort (835). Maybe they didn't include it because it's costly. If I include C48, I might have to remove some items.\n\nLet me see if replacing some lower Wert items in their proposal with C48 would be beneficial.\n\nFor example, C41 in their proposal has a Wert of 138 for me. If I remove C41 (effort 67) and add C48 (effort 835), the effort change would be 835 - 67 = +768. Since the current effort is 2779, adding 768 would make it 3547, which is still under 3207? Wait, 2779 + 768 = 3547, which is over 3207. So that's no good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can remove multiple items. Let's see the total effort if I remove C41 (67) and another item. Let's say I remove B05 (322) as well. So total effort removed would be 67 + 322 = 389. Then adding C48 (835) would increase effort by 835 - 389 = +446. 2779 - 389 = 2390, then +835 = 3225, which is over 3207. Still over by 18.\n\nHmm, maybe remove more. Let's try removing C41 (67), B05 (322), and A35 (280). That's 67+322+280=669. Adding C48 would add 835, so effort becomes 2779 - 669 +835 = 2779 - 669 is 2110 +835 = 2945. That's under 3207. But would that be better for me?\n\nLet me check the Wert change. Original proposal gives me 5641.\n\nIf I remove C41 (138), B05 (508), A35 (389), and add C48 (783), the change is:\n\n-138 -508 -389 +783 = (-1035) +783 = -252. So my total Wert would be 5641 -252 = 5389. That's actually worse.\n\nSo replacing those items would decrease my total Wert. Maybe that's not a good idea.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if I can find items in the proposal that have lower Wert per Effort ratio and see if swapping them with others would help.\n\nLooking at the proposal items, let's calculate Wert/Effort:\n\n- C15: 583/45 \u224812.96\n- C28:822/308\u22482.67\n- A93:808/334\u22482.42\n- C41:138/67\u22482.06\n- B49:668/362\u22481.85\n- A56:780/428\u22481.82\n- B05:508/322\u22481.58\n- B66:461/306\u22481.51\n- C60:484/327\u22481.48\n- A35:389/280\u22481.39\n\nNow, the non-proposal items:\n\n- B78:65/819\u22480.079\n- A75:262/667\u22480.393\n- A60:121/547\u22480.221\n- C48:783/835\u22480.938\n- B10:215/767\u22480.280\n\nSo, the proposal items have mostly higher Wert/Effort ratios. But some non-proposal items have low ratios, except C48, which is 0.938. Comparing with the lowest in the proposal, which is A35 at 1.39. So C48's ratio is lower than all in the proposal, meaning it's less efficient. So maybe including C48 isn't beneficial unless it's really important for me, but in this case, it's not as efficient. However, the Wert is high (783), but the effort is also high (835). So including it would take up a lot of effort for a high Wert, but perhaps we can see if it can replace some items with lower Wert.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if I can remove some low-ratio items and add C48.\n\nFor example, remove B66 (Wert 461, Effort 306) and B05 (508,322). Their total Effort is 306+322=628. If I add C48 (835), the Effort increase is 835 -628=207. So total Effort becomes 2779 -628 +835= 2779 +207=2986, which is under 3207.\n\nThe Wert change is -461 -508 +783= (-969)+783= -186. So my total would be 5641 -186=5455, which is worse. So again, not beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, remove A35 (389,280) and B66 (461,306). Effort removed: 280+306=586. Add C48 (835). Effort increases by 835-586=249. Total Effort 2779 -586=2193 +835=3028, under 3207. Wert change: -389 -461 +783= (-850)+783=-67. So total Wert 5641-67=5574. Still worse.\n\nHmm, maybe adding C48 isn't helpful. Let me consider other non-proposal items. For example, B10 has Wert 215, Effort 767. That's a low ratio. Not useful. A75 is 262 at 667, which is better than some in the proposal, but still worse than many.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I can tweak the proposal to swap some items to get a better total Wert.\n\nFor example, in the proposal, A56 is included (Wert 780). What if I swap A56 with another item not in the proposal that has a higher Wert but similar or less effort.\n\nWait, A56's Effort is 428. The non-proposal items have higher Efforts except for maybe C48 (835) and B10 (767). So it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remove a low Wert item from the proposal and see if adding another gives better total.\n\nLooking at the proposal, the lowest Wert is C41 (138). If I remove it (Effort 67), I can add maybe C48? No, because as before, that would require more effort. Or add B10? No, because B10's Wert is 215, which is higher than 138, but Effort is 767, which is too high. So 67 removed, 767 added: effort increases by 700, which is too much.\n\nAlternatively, remove C41 and add nothing? That would reduce effort but lower my Wert. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove multiple small Effort items to add a higher Wert item.\n\nFor example, remove C41 (67), B66 (306), and A35 (280). Total Effort removed: 67+306+280=653. Then add C48 (835). Effort after addition: 2779 -653 +835= 2779-653=2126+835=2961. Within limit. Wert change: -138-461-389 +783= (-988)+783=-205. So total Wert 5641-205=5436. Still worse.\n\nHmm, maybe I should just accept their proposal because it's already quite good for me. But wait, perhaps I can negotiate a better deal.\n\nAnother approach: maybe they included too many items, and I can argue that some of them are not so important to me, suggesting removing some and adding others.\n\nWait, the proposal includes A56 (Wert 780 for me). That's a high Wert. But maybe the opponent has it as high Wert too? No, I don't know their Werte, but I can try to see what else I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a counteroffer by removing some items they included and adding others.\n\nBut wait, the rule says I can only respond with ABLEHNUNG or ZUSTIMMUNG. Oh no, no, wait: the response options are VORSCHLAG, ABLEHNUNG, ARGUMENT, or ZUSTIMMUNG. So I can make a counter Vorschlag.\n\nBut I need to consider whether it's worth it.\n\nAlternatively, I can send an ARGUMENT to argue against their proposal and suggest changes.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that each message must include at least one ARGUMENT. So I need to include ARGUMENT in my response.\n\nSo, perhaps I can respond by ABLEHNUNG their Vorschlag, and then present a counteroffer, but I have to make sure my counteroffer is better for me.\n\nAlternatively, I can argue against their proposal, pointing out that some items are not beneficial for me and suggest a better combination.\n\nWait, but I can't reveal my Werte, so I have to argue in a way that's general.\n\nFor example, I can say that some items in their proposal are not as efficient in terms of effort, suggesting that we can replace them with other items that provide more value without exceeding the effort limit.\n\nBut without revealing my own Werte, it's tricky. Alternatively, I can suggest that the proposal includes some items that have high effort relative to their overall importance, and that swapping them could allow for more efficient use of the effort budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total Wert for their proposal and see if I can find a better combination. Let's see, their proposal gives me 5641. Let me try to find a better combination.\n\nLet me think which items are must-haves for me. Looking at my Werte, the highest are:\n\n- C28:822\n- C48:783\n- A56:780\n- B49:668\n- A93:808\n- C15:583\n- B05:508\n- C60:484\n- A35:389\n- B66:461\n- C41:138\n- B10:215\n- A75:262\n- A60:121\n- B78:65\n\nSo, the highest are C28 (822), C48 (783), A56 (780), B49 (668), A93 (808). Wait, A93 is in the proposal, so that's good. C28 is in the proposal too.\n\nI think the proposal includes most of the high Wert items, except C48. But as I saw earlier, including C48 would require removing several items, which ends up reducing my total Wert.\n\nAlternatively, can I include C48 without removing too many items?\n\nWait, let's try to include C48 in the proposal. The proposal's current effort is 2779. If I add C48 (Effort 835), the total would be 2779 +835= 3614, which is over 3207. So I need to remove items whose total effort is at least 3614 -3207=407.\n\nSo I need to remove items totaling 407 Effort. Let's see which items in the proposal I can remove to make room for C48.\n\nLooking at the proposal:\n\n- C15:45\n- C28:308\n- A93:334\n- C41:67\n- B49:362\n- A56:428\n- B05:322\n- B66:306\n- C60:327\n- A35:280\n\nI need to remove items totaling 407. Let's see possible combinations.\n\nOption 1: Remove B05 (322) and C41 (67) = 389, which is close but a bit over. So removing these two would mean Effort removed:389, adding C48 (835). So total Effort:2779 -389 +835=2779 -389=2390 +835=3225, which is over by 18. Not good.\n\nOption 2: Remove B66 (306) and C41 (67) = 373. Then add C48 (835). Effort:2779 -373=2406 +835=3241, which is over by 34.\n\nOption 3: Remove B49 (362) and C41 (67)=429. Then add C48 (835). Effort:2779 -429=2350 +835=3185, which is under 3207.\n\nCheck the Wert change: Removing B49 (668) and C41 (138) gives -806. Adding C48 (783). So net change: -806 +783= -23. So total Wert would be 5641 -23=5618. That's worse than the original proposal for me.\n\nOption 4: Remove A56 (428) and C41 (67)=495. Add C48 (835). Effort:2779 -495=2284 +835=3119, under. Wert change: -780 -138 +783= -135. So 5641 -135=5506. Worse.\n\nOption5: Remove B05 (322) and B66 (306)=628. Add C48 (835). Effort:2779 -628=2151 +835=2986. Wert change: -508 -461 +783= -186. Total 5641-186=5455.\n\nStill worse.\n\nOption6: Remove A35 (280) and B66 (306)=586. Add C48 (835). Effort:2779-586=2193+835=3028. Wert change: -389 -461 +783= -67. Total 5641-67=5574.\n\nStill worse.\n\nHmm, so all options where I remove items to add C48 result in lower total Wert for me. So it's not beneficial.\n\nTherefore, maybe the original proposal is the best I can get. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a different combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I can remove some lower Wert items from their proposal and add others that I have higher Wert but were not included. But from the non-proposal items, the only one with high Wert is C48, which we saw doesn't help, and B78, A75, etc., which have even lower Wert.\n\nSo perhaps the original proposal is actually quite good for me. However, I can try to negotiate by suggesting to remove some low-priority items (from their perspective) and adding others that are more beneficial for me, without having to include C48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can suggest a different combination that includes some items not in their proposal but excludes some in their proposal that are low for me.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the proposal includes B05 (Wert 508) and A35 (389), which are not as high as other items. Maybe I can suggest removing these and adding others.\n\nBut from the non-proposal items, the only one with high Wert is C48, but as before, that's not efficient.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the proposal includes A56 (Wert 780) which is high, but also B49 (668). If I remove B49 (Effort 362) and A35 (280), and add C48 (835), but that's already tried.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a combination that includes C48 without removing so many items. Let me see.\n\nWait, the proposal's Effort is 2779. The max is 3207, so I have 3207-2779=428 Effort left. C48 is 835, which is more than that, so can't add C48 without removing something.\n\nBut if I remove some items to make room.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find a way to replace some low-Effort, low-Wert items in the proposal with C48, but I don't think it's possible without losing Wert.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the proposal includes A56 (428 Effort) which is quite high. Maybe I can remove A56 and add some other items.\n\nWait, A56 is in the proposal. If I remove it, Effort reduces by 428, freeing up space. What can I add? I have 428 Effort available, and max Effort becomes 2779 -428=2351. Plus, I can add up to 428 Effort.\n\nLooking at non-proposal items, C48 is 835, which is too big. B78 is 819, also too big. A75 is 667, too big. B10 is 767, too big. The only one that fits is A60 (547), but that's still over 428. So no, I can't add any non-proposal items with the freed Effort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can add multiple smaller Effort items. Let me see.\n\nIf I remove A56 (428), I could add, say, A60 (547) which is too big, so no. Or maybe add B78 (819), no. Alternatively, maybe add B10 and something else. Wait, 428 can be used for smaller items, but the non-proposal items are too big.\n\nTherefore, removing A56 doesn't help because I can't add anything else useful. So that's not useful.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to think that maybe the original proposal is the best possible for me, especially since the opponent has included many of the high-Wert items. Since I can't find a better combination without reducing my total Wert, perhaps I should accept their proposal.\n\nBut wait, let me check if their proposal truly is the best. Maybe the opponent included items that are more beneficial for them, but not necessarily for me.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a counteroffer by removing some items and adding others, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can remove the lower Wert items in their proposal and see if I can add something else. For example, remove C41, B66, and A35. That frees up 67+306+280=653 Effort. What can I add with 653 Effort?\n\nLooking at non-proposal items, I can add C48 (835) which is too big, so no. Alternatively, add B10 (767) and have 653-767 negative, which is no good. So no, can't add anything useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can remove C41 and B66, freeing 373, but still not enough for C48.\n\nWait, maybe instead of removing those, I can remove B05 and B66 (322+306=628). Then add C48 (835), which would require 628 + x =835, but that's 207 more. So the total Effort becomes 2779 -628 +835= 2986, still under. The Wert change is -508-461+783= -186. So total Wert 5641-186=5455.\n\nStill worse.\n\nAnother approach: maybe include C48 and a different set of items.\n\nLet me try starting fresh. Let me pick the top items by Wert and see how much Effort they take.\n\nTop items: C28(822), C48(783), A56(780), B49(668), A93(808), C15(583), B05(508), C60(484), B66(461), A35(389), C41(138).\n\nLet me see if I can include C48.\n\nInclude C28 (308), C48 (835), A56 (428), B49 (362), A93 (334), C15 (45), B05 (322), C60 (327), B66 (306), A35 (280). Wait, but that's 10 items already. Let's calculate Effort.\n\n308+835=1143\n\n1143+428=1571\n\n1571+362=1933\n\n1933+334=2267\n\n2267+45=2312\n\n2312+322=2634\n\n2634+327=2961\n\n2961+306=3267\n\n3267+280=3547.\n\nThat's way over 3207. So too much.\n\nAlternatively, pick a subset.\n\nLet me try C28 (308), C48 (835), A56 (428): total Effort 308+835+428=1571.\n\nRemaining Effort:3207-1571=1636.\n\nNext, add B49 (362): total 1571+362=1933. Remaining:3207-1933=1274.\n\nAdd A93 (334): 1933+334=2267. Remaining:3207-2267=940.\n\nAdd C15 (45): 2267+45=2312. Remaining:3207-2312=895.\n\nAdd B05 (322): 2312+322=2634. Remaining:573.\n\nAdd C60 (327): 2634+327=2961. Remaining:246.\n\nAdd B66 (306): can't, only 246 left.\n\nSo total Effort 2961, and I still have room for 246. Maybe add A35 (280): 2961+280=3241, over by 34. So can't. Or add C41 (67): 2961+67=3028, which is under. So total Effort 3028.\n\nBut my total Wert would be C28(822)+C48(783)+A56(780)+B49(668)+A93(808)+C15(583)+B05(508)+C60(484)+C41(138). Let's add these up:\n\n822+783=1605\n\n1605+780=2385\n\n2385+668=3053\n\n3053+808=3861\n\n3861+583=4444\n\n4444+508=4952\n\n4952+484=5436\n\n5436+138=5574.\n\nThat's 5574, which is worse than the original proposal's 5641. So not better.\n\nHmm, what if I don't include C48? Let's see:\n\nTake C28 (308), A56 (428), B49 (362), A93 (334), C15 (45), B05 (322), C60 (327), B66 (306), A35 (280), C41 (67). This is exactly the opponent's proposal. So 5641.\n\nAlternatively, if I remove C41 and add nothing, total Effort 2779-67=2712, and Wert 5641-138=5503. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, remove C41 and add nothing: same as above.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps add C48 and remove multiple items, but as I saw, the total Wert goes down.\n\nSo perhaps the original proposal is the best I can get.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to include B78. It's in the non-proposal, but has a low Wert for me (65). Probably not useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can suggest a different combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to argue that the proposal is good, but suggest a minor tweak.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that my response includes ARGUMENT.\n\nSo, perhaps I can send an ARGUMENT saying that while their proposal is good, I think we can optimize it by removing some items with lower efficiency and adding others that provide better value for the effort, thus maximizing the overall benefit.\n\nBut without revealing my Werte, I can say something like:\n\nARGUMENT: {'Ich bin bereit, \u00fcber Ihren Vorschlag nachzudenken. Es scheint, dass einige der Gegenst\u00e4nde im Vorschlag zwar eine hohe Wichtigkeit haben, aber einen hohen Aufwand erfordern. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnen wir einige dieser Gegenst\u00e4nde austauschen, um mehr Effizienz zu erreichen.'}\n\nThen perhaps make a Vorschlag with a modified set.\n\nWait, but I can't reveal that I want to include C48, because that might give away my Werte.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a counteroffer that includes C48 but removes some items, even if the Wert is slightly lower, just to see if the opponent accepts.\n\nBut considering the time I've spent, perhaps the best move is to accept their proposal because it's already giving me a good Wert.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to negotiate further, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think: is there any way to get a higher Wert than 5641 without exceeding the Effort?\n\nLooking at all items, the total Wert if I include all would be the sum of all my Werte:\n\nCalculating sum of all Werte:\n\n138 +583 +822 +783 +65 +262 +121 +508 +780 +461 +484 +668 +389 +808 +215.\n\nLet me add them up:\n\n138 +583=721\n\n721+822=1543\n\n1543+783=2326\n\n2326+65=2391\n\n2391+262=2653\n\n2653+121=2774\n\n2774+508=3282\n\n3282+780=4062\n\n4062+461=4523\n\n4523+484=4997\n\n4997+668=5665\n\n5665+389=6054\n\n6054+808=6862\n\n6862+215=7077.\n\nTotal maximum possible Wert is 7077, but of course, we can't include all because Effort is limited.\n\nBut our proposal gives 5641, which is about 80% of the maximum.\n\nIs there a combination that includes more high-Wert items without exceeding Effort?\n\nLet me try to create a new combination.\n\nStart with the highest Wert items:\n\nC28 (308) -822\n\nA93 (334) -808\n\nC48 (835) -783\n\nA56 (428) -780\n\nB49 (362) -668\n\nC15 (45) -583\n\nB05 (322) -508\n\nC60 (327) -484\n\nB66 (306) -461\n\nA35 (280) -389\n\nC41 (67) -138\n\nNow, let's try to include as many high-Wert as possible within 3207.\n\nStart with C28 (308) + A93 (334) = Effort 642, Wert 822+808=1630.\n\nNext, add C48 (835): Effort 642+835=1477, Wert 1630+783=2413.\n\nNext, add A56 (428): Effort 1477+428=1905, Wert 2413+780=3193.\n\nAdd B49 (362): Effort 1905+362=2267, Wert 3193+668=3861.\n\nAdd C15 (45): 2267+45=2312, Wert 3861+583=4444.\n\nAdd B05 (322): 2312+322=2634, Wert 4444+508=4952.\n\nAdd C60 (327): 2634+327=2961, Wert 4952+484=5436.\n\nNow, remaining Effort: 3207-2961=246.\n\nWe can add C41 (67): Effort 2961+67=3028, Wert 5436+138=5574.\n\nOr, instead of C41, perhaps we can add B66 (306), but 2961+306=3267 which is over.\n\nAlternatively, remove some items to add higher ones.\n\nWait, but we've already included most high-Wert items except B66, A35, etc. So total Wert is 5574, which is worse than the original proposal's 5641.\n\nSo, no, that's worse.\n\nTherefore, the original proposal seems better.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps I should accept their proposal because I can't find a better combination without reducing my total Wert.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to make a different proposal that includes C48, but as we saw, it reduces my total.\n\nWait, let me try one more time:\n\nIf I include C48 and remove some items.\n\nOriginal proposal Effort:2779\n\nIf I remove B05 (322) and B66 (306), Effort reduces by 628, adding C48 (835), so Effort becomes 2779 -628 +835=2986.\n\nWert:5641 -508 -461 +783=5641 -969 +783=5641-186=5455.\n\nWhich is worse.\n\nAlternatively, remove B49 (362) and C41 (67)=429, add C48 (835). Effort:2779-429+835=3185. Wert:5641 -668 -138 +783=5641 -806 +783=5618. Also worse.\n\nSo, yes, the original proposal is better.\n\nTherefore, I should accept their proposal.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, I can only accept with ZUSTIMMUNG if it's a previous Vorschlag. So the user's instruction says: \"Du darfst nur einen Vorschlag mit ZUSTIMMUNG akzeptieren, der vom anderen Spieler zuvor mit VORSCHLAG eingebracht wurde.\"\n\nSo, the user's last message was a Vorschlag, so I can respond with ZUSTIMMUNG.\n\nAlternatively, I can send ABLEHNUNG and then a new Vorschlag, but given that the original proposal is the best, perhaps it's better to accept it.\n\nBut I have to include an ARGUMENT in my response.\n\nSo perhaps I can respond with:\n\nABLEHNUNG: {'C15', 'C28', 'A93', 'C41', 'B49', 'A56', 'B05', 'B66', 'C60', 'A35'}\n\nBut that's just rejecting, which may not be productive. Alternatively, accept.\n\nAlternatively, send ZUSTIMMUNG and accept.\n\nWait, the goal is to maximize my Wert, so if I accept, I get 5641.\n\nIf I make a better proposal, perhaps I can get more, but I can't find any.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's best to accept.\n\nAlternatively, try to make a counteroffer, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the opponent will accept my counteroffer, but I'm not sure if it's better.\n\nAlternatively, send an ARGUMENT suggesting that the proposal is acceptable, but maybe we can tweak it.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept.\n\nSo, my final decision is to accept their proposal.\n\nThus, I will send:\n\nZUSTIMMUNG: {'C15', 'C28', 'A93', 'C41', 'B49', 'A56', 'B05', 'B66', 'C60', 'A35'}\n\nAnd add an ARGUMENT explaining why it's a good deal.\n",
