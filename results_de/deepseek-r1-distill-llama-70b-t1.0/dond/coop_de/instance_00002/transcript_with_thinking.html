        <p>Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this cooperative negotiation game. So, me and another player have to divide a set of objects: 1 Phone, 2 Mirrors, and 2 Fruits. Each of us has a secret valuation for these objects. My valuations are Phone:4, Mirror:2, Fruit:1.<br/><br/>Our goal is to maximize the sum of both our points by agreeing on a division of the objects. If we present complementary proposals, meaning our requests don&#x27;t overlap and all objects can be allocated without conflict, we both get points. Otherwise, we both get zero.<br/><br/>First, I need to understand what the other player might value. Since I don&#x27;t know their valuations, I have to make assumptions or negotiate to find out. Let&#x27;s think about possible strategies.<br/><br/>One approach is to try to maximize my own points while leaving enough value for the other player to make the total maximum. Alternatively, maybe the other player might have different preferences. For example, if they value the Phone highly, they might prioritize taking that. Or maybe they prefer Mirrors or Fruits.<br/><br/>I should consider the total points available. My valuation is Phone=4, Mirror=2, Fruit=1. The other player&#x27;s could be different. Let&#x27;s say if the other player&#x27;s valuations are such that they value Phone=3, Mirror=3, Fruit=2, just as an example. But without knowing, I have to negotiate.<br/><br/>Since we can send messages, maybe I can hint at what I want or ask them about their preferences. But since I can&#x27;t reveal my valuations, I have to be strategic. Maybe I can make an initial offer and see how they respond.<br/><br/>But since the objective is to maximize the total, it&#x27;s better for both of us to get the items we value more. So perhaps I can take the Phone since it&#x27;s most valuable to me (4 points), and then offer them the Mirrors or Fruits.<br/><br/>But wait, there&#x27;s only 1 Phone, so if I take that, the other player can&#x27;t have it. Then, for the remaining items, there are 2 Mirrors and 2 Fruits. My valuation for Mirror is 2 each, and Fruit 1 each. So, taking both Mirrors would give me 4 points, while taking both Fruits only 2 points. But maybe the other player values Mirrors higher than Fruits.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Phone (4) and one Mirror (2), that&#x27;s 6 points for me, leaving one Mirror and two Fruits. If the other player values Mirror higher, they might take the remaining Mirror (which would be worth, say, 3 points to them) and maybe the two Fruits (maybe worth 2 points each, totaling 7 for them). So total would be 6 + 7 = 13. Alternatively, if I take Phone and two Mirrors (4+2+2=8), leaving two Fruits, which might be worth, say, 4 points total to them (2 each). So total 8+4=12. So the first scenario is better.<br/><br/>Alternatively, let&#x27;s think of their possible valuations. Maybe they value the Phone more than me? But I don&#x27;t know. If they value Phone at 5, then taking Phone is better for them. But again, without knowing, maybe I should try to negotiate.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose taking the Phone and one Mirror, leaving one Mirror and two Fruits. I can send a message like &quot;I want the Phone and one Mirror.&quot; But since messages are direct, maybe just saying that. Then the other player can respond, maybe accepting or suggesting a different split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to avoid conflict, perhaps I can offer a proposal that&#x27;s mutually beneficial. Wait, but we can each send up to 5 messages, so maybe a conversation can happen. But in case of an impasse, we can make a secret proposal. But since it&#x27;s a thought process, I need to decide what to do.<br/><br/>Wait, I can make a proposal at any time by using [Vorschlag: ...]. But I want to maximize the sum. So perhaps I should check: if I take the Phone (4), and one Mirror (2), and they take the rest (1 Mirror and 2 Fruits). But I don&#x27;t know their valuation, so I can&#x27;t be sure. Alternatively, maybe taking Phone and both Mirrors, leaving Fruits, which might be better for them if they don&#x27;t value Mirrors that much.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the Phone and the two Fruits (total 4 +1+1=6), but that leaves both Mirrors for them, which, if they value them at 3 each, they get 6 points, making total 12.<br/><br/>But perhaps the optimal split is when the total is maximized. Let me think mathematically.<br/><br/>Let me denote:<br/><br/>My points: P = p1*Telefon + p2*Spiegel + p3*Frucht, where p1, p2, p3 are 1 if I take, 0 otherwise.<br/><br/>Similarly for them: Q = q1*Telefon + q2*Spiegel + q3*Frucht.<br/><br/>But they have their own valuations, which I don&#x27;t know. So the total is P + Q, but I don&#x27;t know Q&#x27;s coefficients.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to find the optimal split, the sum would be maximized when each object goes to the person who values it more. So if for each object, the person with the higher valuation for that object takes it.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their valuations, I can&#x27;t calculate that directly.<br/><br/>Wait, the key point is that the total sum is the sum of both our values for the objects. So for the Phone, if I have a higher valuation (4) than them, it&#x27;s better for me to take it. If their valuation is higher, then they should take it.<br/><br/>Same for Mirrors and Fruits. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to deduce or negotiate.<br/><br/>But perhaps I can make an educated guess. Since the Phone is the only one with a quantity of 1, and it&#x27;s worth the most to me, maybe I can try to take it. Then for Mirrors and Fruits, depending on their response.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the Phone is worth so much to me (4), but maybe the other player might not value it as high. So it&#x27;s better to take it.<br/><br/>So, my initial proposal could be to take the Phone, and one Mirror, leaving one Mirror and two Fruits. Then, in the message, I can say something like &quot;I suggest I take the Phone and one Mirror, leaving you with one Mirror and two Fruits.&quot; Then, depending on their response, we can adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should just make a secret proposal right away, but since we can communicate, it&#x27;s better to negotiate to ensure we maximize the sum.<br/><br/>So, the first step is to send a message to the other player indicating my willingness to take the Phone and perhaps one Mirror, but I&#x27;m open to adjustment based on their preference.<br/><br/>Wait, but the messages need to be in German, right? Because the initial instructions were in German. Oh wait, no, the user is communicating with me in English, but the game instructions are in German. Wait, no, the user is actually in a context where the game is explained in German, but our communication is in English. Wait, no, looking back, the system message is in German, but the user&#x27;s query is in English. Hmm, maybe the messages should be in German? Or not? Wait, the user&#x27;s query says that the messages are sent directly, but in the context, the user is to think in English, but perhaps the messages should be in German because that&#x27;s the game&#x27;s language. Hmm, this is confusing.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the user is instructing me in English, but the game instructions are in German, so perhaps the messages sent in the game are in German. But the user&#x27;s query is in English, so maybe the messages can be in English. Hmm, perhaps I&#x27;m overcomplicating.<br/><br/>In any case, my internal thoughts are in English, but the messages to the other player should be in the same language as the game, which is German. So when sending messages, I should use German.<br/><br/>Wait, no, the user is asking me to figure out the reasoning, so perhaps I can think in English, but the actual messages would be in the same language as the game, so German.<br/><br/>But I think for this exercise, the language isn&#x27;t the focus, so I&#x27;ll proceed in English.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, I&#x27;ll try to send a message suggesting a split where I take the Phone and one Mirror, and see how the other player responds. Alternatively, since they might have different valuations, I can ask if they prefer Mirrors or Fruits more, but without revealing my valuations.<br/><br/>Wait, but since we can only send messages directly, maybe I can&#x27;t ask questions. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to make an initial offer and adjust.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can offer taking the Phone and one Mirror, and the other player can either accept or make a counteroffer.<br/><br/>But in this game, each can propose up to 5 messages, but it&#x27;s easier to just make a single proposal and see.<br/><br/>Alternatively, considering that the Phone is the most valuable to me, I should prioritize taking that. If the other player doesn&#x27;t value it as high, then taking it benefits the total. If they do, then it&#x27;s better for them to have it.<br/><br/>Wait, but how can I determine that without knowing their valuations? Maybe I can&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll proceed based on my own valuations.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll make a proposal: I take the Phone, and one Mirror. So my proposal is [Vorschlag: 1 Telefon, 1 Spiegel]. That leaves them with 1 Spiegel and 2 Früchte.<br/><br/>If they accept, then the total would be my points: 4 (Telefon) + 2 (Spiegel) = 6, plus their points from 2 (Spiegel) + 1*2 (Früchte) = 4, so total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take Telefon and both Mirrors, my points would be 4+2+2=8, and they get 2 Früchte, which is 2 points, total 10.<br/><br/>Wait, same total. Hmm. So perhaps it&#x27;s better to have the other player take the Früchte, which I value less, while I take the higher-value items.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take Telefon and one Spiegel, leaving them with one Spiegel and two Früchte, the total is 6 + (their points). If their valuation for Spiegel is higher, then it&#x27;s better for them to have both, but I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the optimal is for me to take the Telefon and the two Früchte, but that&#x27;s worse for me (4+1+1=6), leaving them with two Spiegel, which, if they value each at 3, would give them 6, so total 12.<br/><br/>Wait, that seems better than the previous 10. So perhaps I should propose taking the Telefon and both Früchte, leaving them with both Spiegel.<br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Vorschlag: 1 Telefon, 2 Früchte]. Then, if their valuations are that Spiegel are higher, they take both, getting 3 each (total 6), while I get 4+1+1=6, total 12.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I might not know, but it&#x27;s possible that the other player values Spiegel higher, so it&#x27;s better to give them both Spiegel.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the other player values Früchte higher, so maybe not.<br/><br/>Wait, but since I value Spiegel higher than Früchte, maybe it&#x27;s better for me to keep Spiegel. But without knowing, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the Telefon, and let them have both Spiegel and Früchte. But that might not be efficient.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to make the proposal that gives me the highest points, which would be taking Telefon, two Spiegel, leaving two Früchte. Then my points would be 4+2+2=8, and their points would be 2 (two Früchte), total 10. But if they value Früchte more, their points would be higher.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should balance.<br/><br/>But perhaps the best is to take Telefon (4), one Spiegel (2), and one Frucht (1), but that&#x27;s 7 points, leaving one Spiegel (2) and one Frucht (1), giving them 3 points, total 10. Which is same as before.<br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps it&#x27;s better to take Telefon and both Früchte (6 points), leaving them with two Spiegel (if they value each at 3, total 6, sum 12).<br/><br/>But how do I know their valuations? I don&#x27;t, so maybe I should try to take the highest value for me, which is Telefon, and then see if they can take the rest.<br/><br/>Alternatively, wait, maybe the other player has different preferences. Let me think about possible combinations.<br/><br/>Total items:<br/><br/>1 Telefon, 2 Spiegel, 2 Früchte.<br/><br/>If I take Telefon (4), that&#x27;s my highest. Then, for the remaining 2 Spiegel and 2 Früchte, I can take either Spiegel or Früchte. Since I value Spiegel more, perhaps taking both would be better for me, but if the other player values them more, it&#x27;s better for the total if they take them.<br/><br/>But without knowing, perhaps I can assume that they have similar valuations, but probably not. So, to maximize the total, I should let them take the objects they value more.<br/><br/>So, perhaps I can offer to take Telefon and one Spiegel, leaving them with one Spiegel and two Früchte. That way, if they value Spiegel more than Früchte, they can take the remaining Spiegel, but I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can make a proposal that I take Telefon and leave the rest, but that&#x27;s not efficient for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, to check, let&#x27;s consider all possible allocations.<br/><br/>Option 1: I take Telefon, both Spiegel: My points 8, theirs: 2 Früchte: 2, total 10.<br/><br/>Option 2: I take Telefon, one Spiegel, one Frucht: My points 7, theirs: one Spiegel and one Frucht: let&#x27;s say they value Spiegel more, so their points would be higher.<br/><br/>Option 3: I take Telefon, both Früchte: My points 6, theirs: two Spiegel: if they value each at 3, their points 6, total 12.<br/><br/>Option 4: I take nothing: Obviously not optimal.<br/><br/>So, Option 3 seems better, with total 12 if other player values Spiegel at 3 each, which is possible. So perhaps I should propose that.<br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll propose [Vorschlag: 1 Telefon, 2 Früchte]. Then, they get 2 Spiegel.<br/><br/>If their valuation is such that Spiegel are worth more to them, this would maximize the total. If not, then perhaps we get a lower total.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t accept, we might get zero.<br/><br/>But given that, I think it&#x27;s better to try to maximize the total, so I&#x27;ll make that proposal.<br/></p>
