            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to split these items with the other player. The items we have are 2 Fäden, 3 Bolzen, and 1 Bild. My secret value function is Faden: 0, Bolzen: 1, Bild: 7. So, obviously, the Bild is super valuable to me, and the Bolzen are just okay, while Fäden are worthless.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might want. But since I don't know their value function, I need to guess or try to negotiate in a way that I get the Bild without giving up too much. Since there's only one Bild, I really want that. If I can get the Bild, I get 7 points, which is huge. If I have to give up something in return, maybe some Bolzen or Fäden.\n\nBut wait, my Fäden are worth 0, so giving them away doesn't hurt me. So maybe I can offer some Fäden to the other player. But they might also want the Bild. How can I ensure I get the Bild? Maybe I can suggest taking the Bild and offer something else.\n\nBut if the other player also values the Bild highly, they might not be willing to give it up. So maybe I can make a proposal that includes the Bild for me and compensation in Bolzen. Alternatively, I can try to offer some combination.\n\nI should think about the maximum number of messages I can send is 5, so maybe I can start by making a proposal, and if it's not accepted, adjust accordingly. Let's see.\n\nSo, maybe my first proposal is to take the Bild and two Bolzen. That way, I get 7 + 1 +1 =9 points, leaving the other player with 1 Faden, 1 Bolzen. But wait, the items are 2 Fäden, 3 Bolzen. So if I take 2 Fäden, 1 Bild, that's 7. Or maybe 2 Bolzen and 1 Bild.\n\nWait, no, maybe better to take the Bild and all the Bolzen. But the other player might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe I should first check what they want.\n\nWait, but the problem is, I can't send messages like questions. I have to send proposals or negotiate, but the messages are open, so maybe I can suggest a split. But since the messages are sent directly, maybe I can say something like \"take the Bild and offer something else\".\n\nWait, no, the messages should be in natural language. So I can send a message like \"I think I should get the Bild and one Faden, and you can have the rest.\" But since Fäden are worthless to me, maybe that's a good way to convince them that I don't value them, but they might not know that.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer the other player the 2 Fäden and 2 Bolzen, and keep the Bild and 1 Bolzen. That would give me 7 +1=8 points, and the other player gets Fäden (which I don't value but they might) and 2 Bolzen.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the other player's values. Maybe they also value the Bild highly. So perhaps I should make a proposal that includes the Bild for me and sufficient Bolzen for them so that they agree.\n\nLet me think: I have 2 Fäden, 3 Bolzen, 1 Bild. My values: Faden=0, Bolzen=1, Bild=7.\n\nI need to maximize my score. So, I want the Bild. If I get the Bild, that's 7 points. Now, if the other player also wants the Bild, they might refuse to give it to me, leading to both of us getting 0. So I need to offer them something they value more than what they'd get if we both fail.\n\nSo, I can offer them all the Bolzen or Fäden, but I don't care about those. Let's say I propose that I take the Bild, and give them the 2 Fäden and 2 Bolzen, keeping 1 Bolzen for myself. That way, my score is 7 +1 =8, and the other player gets 2 Fäden and 2 Bolzen. But perhaps if the other player values Bolzen highly, they might accept that.\n\nAlternatively, I could just take the Bild and all 3 Bolzen, giving them the 2 Fäden. My score would be 7 +3=10, but the other player would get nothing except 2 Fäden, which I don't value, but maybe they do. But this is risky because if they don't accept, we both get 0.\n\nSo perhaps starting with a modest offer is better. I'll send a message suggesting that I take the Bild and one Bolzen, and the other player can take the rest. That way, I get 7 +1=8, and the other player gets 2 Fäden and 2 Bolzen. If they don't accept, maybe I can up the offer or try a different approach.\n\nWait, but if I send such a message, they might not agree and perhaps counteroffer. Since I have 5 messages, I can try to negotiate.\n\nAlternatively, I can directly make a proposal in the first message, as a geheimer Vorschlag. But the other player might not have made a proposal yet, so maybe I should wait. Or perhaps make a proposal and see if it's accepted.\n\nBut if I make a geheimer Vorschlag, and the other player hasn't made one yet, it won't be considered complementary. So maybe I should first try to negotiate via messages, and then when the time is right, make a proposal.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused about how the proposals work. If both make a proposal at the same time, and they are complementary, then it's accepted. But if I make a proposal first, and the other player hasn't, then nothing happens, right? So maybe it's better to wait until both have made their proposals.\n\nBut the problem is, the game ends when both have made proposals. So, I should try to make sure that when I do make a proposal, it's complementary with the other player's.\n\nAlternatively, I can send a message suggesting a split, and see if the other player agrees, then make the proposals accordingly.\n\nSo, maybe I can send a message like: \"I take the Bild, and you take the rest. This way, I get the Bild, and you get all the Fäden and Bolzen.\" But since I don't care about the Fäden and Bolzen, this is a good deal for me. But the other player might think that the rest isn't worth much, especially if their value for the Bild is high.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer some Bolzen in exchange for the Bild, so that I get the Bild and maybe a Bolzen, and they take the Fäden and the remaining Bolzen.\n\nI think it's best to try to communicate a proposal. So, in the first message, I can say something like: \"How about I take the Bild and one Bolzen, and you take the rest.\" Then, if they agree, we can both make the same proposal, ensuring that we both get the points. If they don't agree, I can try to adjust my offer.\n\nAlternatively, I could send a proposal directly, but only after some negotiation.\n\nWait, but the geheimer Vorschlag is in a specific format. So, if I decide to make a proposal, I have to use the exact format: [Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, ...]. So, for example, if I want to take the Bild and one Bolzen, I would write \"[Vorschlag: 1 Bild, 1 Bolzen]\". But the other player needs to also make a complementary proposal, so they would need to take the rest.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the Bild and all the Bolzen, I would write \"[Vorschlag: 1 Bild, 3 Bolzen]\", but that might not leave enough for the other player unless they take the Fäden. But the Fäden are 2, so maybe they would take those.\n\nBut if the other player doesn't want to give up the Bild, they might not accept that. So, maybe a better approach is to give them something they value more than the alternative.\n\nAlternatively, I can send a message like: \"If I take the Bild and one Bolzen, can you accept that?\" Then, if they agree, we can both make the proposal.\n\nBut I'm not sure how they'll respond. They might try to negotiate for a better deal.\n\nWait, but since I can send up to 5 messages, perhaps I can start by suggesting a split, and see how they react.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible sequence:\n\n1. I send a message: \"I would like the Bild. If I take the Bild, can you take the rest?\"\n\nThey might respond with something like \"No, I want the Bild too.\" Or they might accept, or maybe suggest a different split.\n\nIf they refuse, I might have to offer them something else. Maybe I can offer them more Bolzen.\n\nFor example, in the second message: \"How about I take the Bild and one Bolzen, and you take the rest?\"\n\nIf they still refuse, maybe I can offer them two Bolzen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think the Fäden are more valuable than I do, so giving them the Fäden might be more attractive.\n\nWait, but Fäden are worthless to me, so giving them the Fäden is costless. Maybe they value them more, so I can offer the Fäden to get the Bild.\n\nSo, my first message could be: \"I'm happy to give you all the Fäden if I can have the Bild and some Bolzen.\"\n\nBut again, I don't know their preferences. Maybe they value the Fäden highly.\n\nAlternatively, I can start by making a geheimer Vorschlag, but that might end the game before the other player is ready. So perhaps better to negotiate first.\n\nWait, the rules say that you can send up to 5 messages, and if you send a geheimer Vorschlag, the game ends, or you can end it early. So maybe after some negotiation, make a proposal.\n\nAlternatively, I could make the first proposal, but if it's not complementary, both get zero, which is bad. So, better to make sure that both can accept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can offer to take the Bild and one Bolzen, leaving them with the rest.\n\nBut again, the other player might not accept because maybe they also want the Bild.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the possible splits:\n\nTotal items: 2F, 3B, 1Bi.\n\nIf I take Bi and 1B, they get 2F and 2B.\n\nIf I take Bi and 2B, they get 2F and 1B.\n\nIf I take Bi and 3B, they get 2F.\n\nIf I take Bi and 0B, they get 2F and 3B.\n\nI think the best for me is to take Bi and as many B as I can without them refusing.\n\nBut if I take Bi and all 3B, they get nothing except 2F, which I don't value, but perhaps they do. So, that might be a good deal for me, but maybe they won't accept.\n\nAlternatively, offering a split where they get some B and I get Bi and some B.\n\nWait, perhaps the other player's valuation is such that they also want the Bild. So, the only way both can get a positive score is if one takes the Bild and the other takes the rest, or neither takes the Bild but then the rest can be split.\n\nWait, but the Bild is only one, so only one can take it. So, perhaps the other player might not be willing to give it up, leading to both getting zero. So, I need to offer them something they find more valuable than not taking the Bild.\n\nBut I don't know their valuations. So, I can only guess.\n\nMaybe the safest way is to send a message suggesting that I take the Bild, and offer them all the Bolzen and Fäden. If they accept, great. If not, I can adjust.\n\nSo, message 1: \"I'll take the Bild, and you can have the rest.\"\n\nIf they accept, we can both make the proposal. If they don't, maybe they want the Bild too.\n\nIf they reject, I can offer to share some Bolzen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's valuations are such that Fäden are valuable to them, so giving them the Fäden is a good deal.\n\nWait, but I don't know. So, perhaps I should make the initial offer and see.\n\nSo, my first message is: \"I'll take the Bild, and you can have the rest.\"\n\nIf they don't accept, I might have to offer something else.\n\nBut the problem is, the other player might also send a message, and the negotiation can go back and forth.\n\nAlternatively, since I can send 5 messages, perhaps I can try to bluff and say that I have a high value for Fäden, trying to get the Bild.\n\nBut since my Fäden are 0, but the other player doesn't know that, I can pretend that I really want the Fäden, so that they might give me the Bild in exchange.\n\nBut that's risky because if they don't believe me, they might not agree.\n\nAlternatively, since Fäden are 2, maybe they are easier to split, but I don't care.\n\nI think the best approach is to make a reasonable offer that gives me the Bild while giving them the rest, and if they refuse, adjust accordingly.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my move in this negotiation game. Let me take it step by step. \n\nFirst, the available objects are 2 Fäden, 3 Bolzen, and 1 Bild. My secret valuation is Faden: 3, Bolzen: 0, Bild: 4. So, I value the Bild the most, followed by the Fäden, and the Bolzen are worthless to me. \n\nThe other player has already made a secret proposal, but I don't know what it is yet. My goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, is complementary, meaning we don't overlap in our requests and there are enough items to fulfill both. If we do that, we both get points based on the sum of our valuations for the items we receive. If not, we both get zero.\n\nSo, I need to think about what the other player might have proposed. Since I don't have any communication yet, except that they've made a proposal, I have to make an educated guess based on the possible strategies they might use. \n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Other player values Bild highly:** They might go for the Bild and maybe some Fäden or Bolzen. Since the Bild is unique, if they took it, I can't have it. But since my valuation for the Bild is higher (4), I might want to prioritize that.\n\n2. **Other player might not value Bild as much:** They could be going for Fäden and Bolzen, which are more numerous. But since there are only 2 Fäden and 3 Bolzen, they might try to take those.\n\nMy strategy should maximize my own points while anticipating the other player's move. Since I value the Bild the highest, I should try to get it if possible. But I need to leave enough items for the other player so that our proposals are complementary.\n\nLet me outline possible allocations:\n\n- If I take the Bild and one Faden, that's 1 Bild and 1 Faden. Then the other player could take the remaining 1 Faden and 3 Bolzen. But Wait, the other player might also want the Bild. If they also asked for the Bild, our proposals would conflict, and we'd both get zero. So that's risky.\n\n- Alternatively, I could take both Fäden. That's 2 Fäden. If the other player takes the Bild and maybe some Bolzen, then our proposals would be complementary. But wait, the total Bolzen are 3. If I don't take any, the other player could take all 3. But my valuation for Bolzen is zero, so it doesn't matter to me. But the point is to make sure that the sum of our requests doesn't exceed the available quantities.\n\nWait, let's calculate:\n\nTotal items:\n\n- Faden: 2\n- Bolzen: 3\n- Bild: 1\n\nIf I propose [1 Bild, 1 Faden], then the remaining items would be 1 Faden and 3 Bolzen. The other player could take 1 Faden and 3 Bolzen. But if the other player also asked for the Bild, we'd conflict. So I need to see if that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 Fäden, the other player can't take any Faden, but they might take the Bild and all 3 Bolzen. That way, my proposal would be [2 Fäden], and theirs could be [1 Bild, 3 Bolzen]. That would be complementary, and both of us get our desired items.\n\nBut wait, my valuation for Fäden is 3 each, so 2 Fäden would give me 6 points. Plus, if I leave the Bild for the other player, but I don't get any points for that. Alternatively, if I take the Bild, I get 4 points, plus maybe a Faden for 3, totaling 7 points, which is better. But the risk is that the other player also wants the Bild, leading to both of us getting zero.\n\nIs there a way to minimize that risk? Well, without communication, it's a gamble. But maybe I can make a balanced proposal that covers both possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the other player's possible valuation. Since I don't know their values, they might prioritize differently. They could have a high value for Bild as well, or maybe for Fäden or Bolzen.\n\nIf they have a high valuation for Bild, they would have proposed taking it. So if I also take the Bild, we'd clash. But if they took Fäden and Bolzen, then taking the Bild plus a Faden could work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the Bild and both Fäden, but that's 1 Bild and 2 Fäden. That would leave 0 Fäden and 3 Bolzen. If the other player didn't take the Bild, they could take all the Bolzen. But if they wanted the Bild, we clash.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just take the Bild and one Faden, leaving one Faden and 3 Bolzen. Then the other player could take the remaining Faden and Bolzen. But again, if they wanted the Bild, we have a problem.\n\nAnother approach: Since the other player has already made a proposal, perhaps I should consider what's left. Wait, no, because their proposal is secret, and I don't know it yet. I have to make my proposal without knowing theirs, and then the system will check if they are complementary.\n\nWait, no, the other player made a proposal, and now it's my turn to make mine. So the system will compare both and see if they are complementary.\n\nSo, my proposal needs to not overlap with theirs. So I have to guess what they might have taken, and choose items that are not overlapping.\n\nBut without knowing their proposal, it's hard. So perhaps a safe approach is to take items that are less likely to be taken by them, or to take a combination that leaves enough for them.\n\nAnother idea: Since there's only 1 Bild, if I take it, the other player can't have it. If I don't take it, they might have taken it. So, maybe I should take it to secure that 4 points, and then take some Fäden, but not all.\n\nSo, let's say I propose [1 Bild, 1 Faden]. Then, if the other player took, say, 1 Faden and 3 Bolzen, then the Faden would clash, because each of us took 1 Faden, but there are only 2. So, 1+1=2, which is exactly the number available. So that's okay. Or, maybe the other player took 2 Fäden, in which case, if I took 1, it's 3 Fäden total, but there are only 2, so that's a conflict.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nTotal Fäden: 2. If I take 1, the other can take 1. If I take 2, the other can't take any.\n\nSimilarly, Bolzen: 3. They can be split as 3-0, 2-1, 1-2, 0-3.\n\nBild: 1, so only one can take it.\n\nSo, possible scenarios:\n\n1. I take Bild and 1 Faden. Other takes 1 Faden and 3 Bolzen. Total: I get 4+3=7 points, other gets (their valuation for Faden and Bolzen). But if other's valuation for Faden is high, they'd want more.\n\n2. I take 2 Fäden. Other takes Bild and 3 Bolzen. Then I get 6 points, other gets their valuation for Bild and Bolzen.\n\n3. I take Bild and 2 Fäden. Other takes 3 Bolzen. I get 4+3+3=10, but only if they didn't take Bild or Fäden. But if they took Bild, conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, I have to maximize my minimum gain. So, maybe I should go for the Bild plus 1 Faden, because that gives me 7 points if the other player took the remaining Faden and Bolzen. Alternatively, if I take 2 Fäden, I get 6, but maybe the other player took the Bild and 3 Bolzen, which is okay.\n\nBut which is better for me? 7 vs 6. So, I should aim for the higher value. Therefore, I'll propose [1 Bild, 1 Faden].\n\nWait, but if the other player also took the Bild, we both proposed the Bild, which is only 1, so it's a conflict. Then both get zero. So that's a risk. Alternatively, if the other player took Fäden and Bolzen, then I'm safe.\n\nIs the potential 7 points worth the risk of getting zero? Or should I play it safe and take 2 Fäden, ensuring at least 6 points as long as the other player didn't take any Fäden, which is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take the Bild and both Fäden, but that's 1 Bild and 2 Fäden, which uses up all Fäden and the Bild, leaving 3 Bolzen. If the other player didn't take any of those, that's okay, but they might have taken some.\n\nWait, but if I take all Fäden and the Bild, that's 1+2=3 items. The other player can only take the 3 Bolzen. But if they didn't take the Bolzen, perhaps because they took some Fäden or the Bild, then we might have a conflict.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should go with the higher value. Taking the Bild and 1 Faden gives me 7 points, but there's a risk if the other player also took the Bild. Alternatively, taking 2 Fäden gives me 6 points, which is safer, but less.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize my points, and if the other player also wants the Bild, we both lose. But if not, I gain more. So maybe it's worth the risk.\n\nAlternatively, to minimize the risk, perhaps I can take the Bild and 1 Faden, and if the other player didn't take the Bild, that's great. If they did, we both get zero, but maybe they prefer to avoid that as well.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with [1 Bild, 1 Faden]. That way, I try to get the highest value for myself while leaving enough for the other player if they didn't take the Bild.\n"
