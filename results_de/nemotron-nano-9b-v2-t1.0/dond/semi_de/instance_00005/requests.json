Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Würfel, 1 Ball, 1 Klebstoff, 1 Batterie\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nWürfel: 1, Ball: 7, Klebstoff: 0, Batterie: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

My secret values are: dice 1 each, ball 7, glue 0, battery 1. So the ball is super valuable to me, and the dice are not so much. The other player's values are unknown, but I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The ball is worth 7, which is way higher than the others. So I should definitely try to get the ball. The battery is worth 1, same as each die. Glue is worthless to me. \n\nThe other player might value different items. For example, maybe they value the dice more, or the battery. But since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's attractive to them. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we each want don't overlap), we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So I need to make a proposal that the other player would accept, meaning they should get items that are valuable to them, and I get the ball and maybe some other items.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, but each message is a secret proposal or a regular message. But the secret proposal is in the specific format. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the instructions say that if I make a secret proposal, it's in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I need to decide what to propose. Let me think. If I propose to take the ball and maybe the battery, and leave the dice and glue for the other player. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal would complement mine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the ball and the battery, and the other player could take the two dice and the glue. But I don't know if the other player values the dice or the battery. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the ball and the glue (since glue is worthless to me, but maybe the other player values it). But that might not be good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the ball and the battery, and the other player takes the two dice. But if the other player's value for the dice is higher than my value for the battery, that could be a good deal. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. The ball is my highest value, so I should definitely get that. Then, maybe the battery is a good second item. \n\nSo my secret proposal could be: [Proposal: 1 Ball, 1 Battery]. That way, I get the ball (7 points) and the battery (1 point), totaling 8. The other player would need to take the two dice and the glue. If their value for the dice is higher than my value for the battery, they might accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the ball and the glue, but that's worse for me. \n\nWait, but the other player's proposal would need to be complementary. So if I take the ball and battery, the other player would need to take the two dice and the glue. If their value for the dice is higher than my value for the battery, they would accept. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the ball and the dice, but that's worse for me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take the ball and the glue, and the other player takes the two dice and the battery. But again, depends on their values. \n\nSince I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's as attractive as possible. The ball is my top priority. So I should definitely include that. Then, maybe the battery is a good second item. \n\nSo my first secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Ball, 1 Battery]. Then, the other player would have to respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a regular message first, but the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format. So maybe I should start with a secret proposal. \n\nBut the user is asking me to start the negotiation. So I need to make my first move. Since I can send up to 5 messages, but each secret proposal is a message. \n\nSo I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the ball and maybe the battery. Let me go with that. \n\nSo my first message would be: [Proposal: 1 Ball, 1 Battery]. That way, I get the ball (7) and the battery (1), total 8. The other player would need to take the two dice and the glue. If their value for the dice is higher than my value for the battery, they would accept. \n\nAlternatively, if they value the battery more, they might not accept.
