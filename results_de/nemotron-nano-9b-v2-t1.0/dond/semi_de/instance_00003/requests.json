            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of the items: 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge. My secret value function is Hat:4, Pen:2, Sponge:0. So I really want the hat and pens, but the sponge is worthless to me. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's attractive to them. The key is to get a proposal that's complementary. If I offer items that they value, they might accept. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should offer the items I value the most and see if they can complement.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if my proposal and theirs are complementary, we both get points. Otherwise, zero. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since I have a secret value function, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also consider that the other player might value different items.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the items I want, and hope that the other player's proposal complements. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a proposal that includes the hat and pens, since those are valuable to me. If the other player's proposal includes the sponge, which I don't care about, but maybe they value it. But if I propose the hat and pens, and they propose the sponge, then it's not complementary. So that would be bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and some pens, and leave the sponge for them. But if they don't value the sponge, they might not accept. Hmm.\n\nWait, the sponge is worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values it. If I can get the sponge, it's not a problem for me. But if I don't get it, it's okay. So maybe I should propose the hat and pens, and leave the sponge for them. But if they don't want the sponge, they might not accept. But if they do, then it's good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and some pens, and the other player might propose the sponge. But if their proposal is just the sponge, then it's not complementary. So that would be bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and the sponge, but since the sponge is worthless to me, that's not good. So that's not a good idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and all three pens. That would be my best possible outcome. But if the other player's proposal is, say, the sponge, then it's not complementary. So that would be bad. But if they propose something else, maybe.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should make a proposal that's as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player's proposal complements. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that's more balanced.\n\nWait, the items are 1 hat, 3 pens, 1 sponge. So total items are 5. If I propose, say, the hat and 2 pens, and the other player proposes the remaining pen and the sponge. Then that would be complementary. But if their proposal is different, it might not.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the hat and all three pens. If they propose the sponge, then it's not complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe. But if they don't have a proposal that includes the sponge, then maybe they would accept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and one pen, and leave the other two pens and the sponge for them. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The rules say that each player can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal first. But the user is asking me to start the negotiation. The initial message is from me, so I need to send a message or a secret proposal.\n\nThe user's instruction says that if it's not a secret proposal, the message is sent directly. So I need to decide whether to send a regular message or a secret proposal.\n\nBut the user hasn't sent any messages yet. So maybe I should start by sending a regular message to the other player, proposing something. But the problem is that the other player's response would be a message or a secret proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. But the rules say that each player can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now.\n\nBut the user is asking me to start the negotiation. So perhaps I should send a message to the other player, proposing something. For example, \"I propose to take the hat and all three pens. Let me know if you have a proposal.\"\n\nBut according to the rules, if I send a message that's not a secret proposal, it's sent directly. So the other player would receive that message. Then they might respond with a message or a secret proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player can't see it unless they also make a secret proposal. But if I make a secret proposal, and they don't, then I can't know if it's complementary. So maybe it's better to send a regular message first.\n\nBut the problem is that the other player might not respond. So maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So if I send that, it's a secret. Otherwise, it's a regular message.\n\nSo, considering that, maybe I should make a secret proposal. For example, [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That way, I'm offering the items I value the most. If the other player's proposal is complementary, then we both get points. If not, we get zero.\n\nBut if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know about it unless they also make a secret proposal. So maybe it's better to send a regular message first. For example, \"I'm willing to take the hat and all three pens. What do you propose?\"\n\nBut the other player might not respond. Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think about the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens], and the other player makes a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Sponge], then they are not complementary. So both get zero. But if the other player's proposal is [Proposal: 1 Pen, 1 Sponge], then it's not complementary either. But if they propose [Proposal: 1 Pen], then it's not complementary. So maybe that's not a good idea.\n\nAlternatively, if I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat], and the other player proposes [Proposal: 3 Pens, 1 Sponge], then it's complementary. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and one pen, and the other player might propose the remaining two pens and the sponge. But again, without knowing their values, it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and the sponge. But since the sponge is worthless to me, that's not good. But if the other player values the sponge, they might accept. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and two pens, and leave one pen and the sponge for them. If they value the pen and sponge, they might accept. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nSince I don't have information about the other player's values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are the hat and pens. So I'll make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That way, if the other player's proposal is complementary, I get the maximum value. If not, I get zero. But it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a regular message first. For example, \"I want the hat and all three pens. What do you want?\" But the other player might not respond, or they might make a secret proposal.\n\nBut according to the rules, the secret proposal is made by using the specific format. So if I send a message like \"I propose to take the hat and pens,\" that's a regular message. If I send [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens], that's a secret proposal.\n\nSince the user is asking me to start the negotiation, I need to decide which approach to take. Given that the secret proposal is more strategic, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a regular message to the other player, proposing my items. For example, \"I propose to take the hat and all three pens. Let me know if you have a proposal.\"\n\nBut the other player might respond with a secret proposal or a regular message. If they respond with a secret proposal, then I can check if it's complementary. If not, I can adjust.\n\nBut since I can only send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me go with that. So my first move is to send a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That's my best possible outcome. If the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and two pens, leaving one pen and the sponge. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAnother thought: since the sponge is worthless to me, maybe I should offer it to the other player. If they value it, they might accept. But if I don't get it, it's okay. So maybe I should propose the hat and pens, and let them take the sponge. But if they don't want the sponge, they might not accept.\n\nBut if I propose the hat and pens, and they propose the sponge, then it's not complementary. So that's bad. So maybe I should propose the hat and pens, and hope that the other player's proposal includes the sponge. But if they don't, then it's not complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and one pen, and the other player can take the remaining two pens and the sponge. But again, without knowing their values, it's uncertain.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since I don't know the other player's values, the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So I'll go with the secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That's my best shot. If the other player's proposal is complementary, I get 4 + 2*3 = 10 points. If not, zero. But it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a regular message. For example, \"I want the hat and all three pens. What do you want?\" But the other player might not respond, or they might make a secret proposal. If they make a secret proposal, I can then respond accordingly.\n\nBut since the user is asking me to start, I need to make a move. Given the uncertainty, making a secret proposal might be better because it's a direct offer. So I'll proceed with that.\n",
