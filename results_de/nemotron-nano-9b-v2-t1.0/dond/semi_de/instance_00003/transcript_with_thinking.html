        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of the items: 1 hat, 3 pens, and 1 sponge. My secret value function is Hat:4, Pen:2, Sponge:0. So I really want the hat and pens, but the sponge is worthless to me. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might value. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s attractive to them. The key is to get a proposal that&#x27;s complementary. If I offer items that they value, they might accept. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should offer the items I value the most and see if they can complement.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that if my proposal and theirs are complementary, we both get points. Otherwise, zero. So I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be accepted. Since I have a secret value function, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, but also consider that the other player might value different items.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the items I want, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements. Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can make a proposal that includes the hat and pens, since those are valuable to me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the sponge, which I don&#x27;t care about, but maybe they value it. But if I propose the hat and pens, and they propose the sponge, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So that would be bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and some pens, and leave the sponge for them. But if they don&#x27;t value the sponge, they might not accept. Hmm.<br/><br/>Wait, the sponge is worth 0 to me, but maybe the other player values it. If I can get the sponge, it&#x27;s not a problem for me. But if I don&#x27;t get it, it&#x27;s okay. So maybe I should propose the hat and pens, and leave the sponge for them. But if they don&#x27;t want the sponge, they might not accept. But if they do, then it&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and some pens, and the other player might propose the sponge. But if their proposal is just the sponge, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So that would be bad.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and the sponge, but since the sponge is worthless to me, that&#x27;s not good. So that&#x27;s not a good idea.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and all three pens. That would be my best possible outcome. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is, say, the sponge, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So that would be bad. But if they propose something else, maybe.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal complements. Alternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that&#x27;s more balanced.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 1 hat, 3 pens, 1 sponge. So total items are 5. If I propose, say, the hat and 2 pens, and the other player proposes the remaining pen and the sponge. Then that would be complementary. But if their proposal is different, it might not.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose the hat and all three pens. If they propose the sponge, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe. But if they don&#x27;t have a proposal that includes the sponge, then maybe they would accept.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and one pen, and leave the other two pens and the sponge for them. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. The rules say that each player can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal first. But the user is asking me to start the negotiation. The initial message is from me, so I need to send a message or a secret proposal.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s instruction says that if it&#x27;s not a secret proposal, the message is sent directly. So I need to decide whether to send a regular message or a secret proposal.<br/><br/>But the user hasn&#x27;t sent any messages yet. So maybe I should start by sending a regular message to the other player, proposing something. But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s response would be a message or a secret proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. But the rules say that each player can make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should make a secret proposal now.<br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the negotiation. So perhaps I should send a message to the other player, proposing something. For example, &quot;I propose to take the hat and all three pens. Let me know if you have a proposal.&quot;<br/><br/>But according to the rules, if I send a message that&#x27;s not a secret proposal, it&#x27;s sent directly. So the other player would receive that message. Then they might respond with a message or a secret proposal.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player can&#x27;t see it unless they also make a secret proposal. But if I make a secret proposal, and they don&#x27;t, then I can&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s complementary. So maybe it&#x27;s better to send a regular message first.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player might not respond. So maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So if I send that, it&#x27;s a secret. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a regular message.<br/><br/>So, considering that, maybe I should make a secret proposal. For example, [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That way, I&#x27;m offering the items I value the most. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then we both get points. If not, we get zero.<br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know about it unless they also make a secret proposal. So maybe it&#x27;s better to send a regular message first. For example, &quot;I&#x27;m willing to take the hat and all three pens. What do you propose?&quot;<br/><br/>But the other player might not respond. Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think about the possible outcomes.<br/><br/>If I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens], and the other player makes a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Sponge], then they are not complementary. So both get zero. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal is [Proposal: 1 Pen, 1 Sponge], then it&#x27;s not complementary either. But if they propose [Proposal: 1 Pen], then it&#x27;s not complementary. So maybe that&#x27;s not a good idea.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat], and the other player proposes [Proposal: 3 Pens, 1 Sponge], then it&#x27;s complementary. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to predict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and one pen, and the other player might propose the remaining two pens and the sponge. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s uncertain.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and the sponge. But since the sponge is worthless to me, that&#x27;s not good. But if the other player values the sponge, they might accept. But I don&#x27;t know.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and two pens, and leave one pen and the sponge for them. If they value the pen and sponge, they might accept. But again, it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t have information about the other player&#x27;s values, maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are the hat and pens. So I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, I get the maximum value. If not, I get zero. But it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a regular message first. For example, &quot;I want the hat and all three pens. What do you want?&quot; But the other player might not respond, or they might make a secret proposal.<br/><br/>But according to the rules, the secret proposal is made by using the specific format. So if I send a message like &quot;I propose to take the hat and pens,&quot; that&#x27;s a regular message. If I send [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens], that&#x27;s a secret proposal.<br/><br/>Since the user is asking me to start the negotiation, I need to decide which approach to take. Given that the secret proposal is more strategic, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a regular message to the other player, proposing my items. For example, &quot;I propose to take the hat and all three pens. Let me know if you have a proposal.&quot;<br/><br/>But the other player might respond with a secret proposal or a regular message. If they respond with a secret proposal, then I can check if it&#x27;s complementary. If not, I can adjust.<br/><br/>But since I can only send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to be efficient.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal now. Let me go with that. So my first move is to send a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That&#x27;s my best possible outcome. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and two pens, leaving one pen and the sponge. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Another thought: since the sponge is worthless to me, maybe I should offer it to the other player. If they value it, they might accept. But if I don&#x27;t get it, it&#x27;s okay. So maybe I should propose the hat and pens, and let them take the sponge. But if they don&#x27;t want the sponge, they might not accept.<br/><br/>But if I propose the hat and pens, and they propose the sponge, then it&#x27;s not complementary. So that&#x27;s bad. So maybe I should propose the hat and pens, and hope that the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the sponge. But if they don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and one pen, and the other player can take the remaining two pens and the sponge. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s uncertain.<br/><br/>Hmm. This is tricky. Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, the best I can do is to propose the items I value the most. So I&#x27;ll go with the secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Hat, 3 Pens]. That&#x27;s my best shot. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, I get 4 + 2*3 = 10 points. If not, zero. But it&#x27;s a gamble.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a regular message. For example, &quot;I want the hat and all three pens. What do you want?&quot; But the other player might not respond, or they might make a secret proposal. If they make a secret proposal, I can then respond accordingly.<br/><br/>But since the user is asking me to start, I need to make a move. Given the uncertainty, making a secret proposal might be better because it&#x27;s a direct offer. So I&#x27;ll proceed with that.<br/></p>
