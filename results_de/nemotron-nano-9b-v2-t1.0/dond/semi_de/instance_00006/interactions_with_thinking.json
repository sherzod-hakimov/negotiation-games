                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 3 apples, 1 soap, and 1 egg. My secret values are apple:1, soap:3, egg:4. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to get a high score by making a proposal that complements the other's, so both get points.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The egg is worth 4, which is the highest. Then soap at 3, and apples at 1. So I probably want to get the egg and maybe the soap. But I need to think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions or try to find a balance.\n\nIf I propose taking the egg and the soap, that's two items. The other player would need to take the three apples. But if their value for apples is low, maybe they would accept. Alternatively, if they value the egg highly, they might not accept my proposal. But since I can't know, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the items in a way that both get something valuable. For example, if I take the egg and one apple, and the other takes the soap and two apples. But I need to check if that's possible. The total items are 3 apples, 1 soap, 1 egg. So if I take 1 apple and the egg, that's 2 items. The other would take 2 apples and the soap. That's 3 items. That works. But would that be a good split?\n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose something that's likely to be acceptable. For example, if I take the egg and the soap, that's 2 items. The other would need to take the 3 apples. If their value for apples is low, they might accept. But if they value the egg or soap more, they might not. Alternatively, if I take the egg and one apple, and the other takes the soap and two apples. That way, both get some valuable items. But again, without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to make a proposal that's as balanced as possible. For example, I could propose taking the egg and the soap, and the other would take the apples. If that's complementary, we both get points. But if not, we get zero. Alternatively, maybe propose taking the egg and one apple, and the other takes the soap and two apples. That way, both get some items. But again, depends on their values.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I should start by proposing something. Let me think about the first message. The first message should be a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to decide which items to propose.\n\nIf I propose the egg and the soap, that's [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. Then the other player would need to propose the 3 apples. If their proposal is [Proposal: 3 Apples], then it's complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe not. Alternatively, if I propose the egg and one apple, and the other proposes the soap and two apples. That would be complementary. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and the other might propose the apples. If that's the case, then we both get points. But if the other player's value for apples is low, they might not accept. But since I don't know, maybe that's the best bet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and the soap, and if the other player's proposal is the apples, then it's good. If not, maybe I can adjust. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nAnother thought: the egg is the most valuable to me. So I should definitely try to get it. The soap is next. So maybe my first proposal is to take the egg and the soap. Then the other player would need to take the apples. If they accept, we both get points. If not, maybe I can adjust in subsequent messages.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is in the correct format. So the first message should be a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to write that. For example, [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap].\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the egg and one apple. That way, the other player can take the soap and two apples. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the safest is to propose the most valuable items to me. So egg and soap. Let me go with that. So my first message is [Proposal: 1 Egg, 1 Soap]. Then the other player would have to respond with their proposal. If their proposal is the 3 apples, then it's complementary. If not, maybe we can negotiate further.\n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be careful. If the first proposal is not accepted, I might need to adjust. But for now, the first step is to make a proposal. So I'll start with that.\n"
