Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n4 Papiere, 2 Uhren, 2 Kartoffeln\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nPapier: 1, Uhr: 1, Kartoffel: 2\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My secret value function is 1 for paper, 1 for clock, and 2 for potato. The goal is to get a high score by making a secret proposal that complements the other player's. \n\nFirst, I should think about what items are valuable to me. Potatoes are worth 2 each, so I really want those. Clocks are 1 each, and papers are 1 each. Since there are 2 potatoes, maybe I should aim to get both. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine. \n\nIf I propose to take both potatoes, then the other player might also want them. But if I can get both, that's 4 points. Then, maybe I can take some papers or clocks. But I need to check if the other player's proposal allows that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose something that leaves enough for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock, that's 2*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 7 points. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't take those items. \n\nWait, but the other player's value function is unknown. They might value different items. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe I should focus on the items I value most. \n\nSince potatoes are the highest value, I should definitely try to get both. Then, maybe take some papers or clocks. But I need to leave enough for the other player. Let me think about the total items. There are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. \n\nIf I take both potatoes, that's 2. Then, maybe take 2 papers and 1 clock. That would leave 2 papers and 1 clock for the other player. If the other player's proposal is to take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, then that would be complementary. But I don't know their value function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That's 2*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 7. If the other player's proposal is to take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, then that's 2*1 + 1*1 = 3. But if their value function is different, maybe they would prefer different items. \n\nBut since I don't know their value function, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe the best approach is to propose taking the most valuable items for me, which are the potatoes. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. \n\nWait, but the format requires numbers and object names. So the exact format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I need to write that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 1 clock and 2 papers. But again, depends on their value. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. Maybe the first message is my secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...], and if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. \n\nSo my first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me decide what to propose. Since potatoes are worth 2 each, getting both would give me 4 points. Then, maybe take 2 papers (2 points) and 1 clock (1 point), totaling 7. That's a good deal. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't take those items. If they also want potatoes, then we might have a conflict. But if I can get both potatoes, that's a big win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That's 2*2 + 1*1 = 5. Then the other player could take 2 papers and 1 clock. But again, depends on their value. \n\nHmm. Since I don't know their value function, maybe the safest bet is to take the items I value most. So 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That's 7 points. If the other player's proposal is to take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, then that's 2*1 + 1*1 = 3. But if their value function is different, maybe they would prefer other items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That's 5 points. Then the other player could take 2 papers and 1 clock. But again, not sure. \n\nI think the key is to maximize my own value. So I should propose taking as many high-value items as possible. So 2 potatoes (4 points), 2 papers (2 points), and 1 clock (1 point). Total 7. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. If they propose something that doesn't conflict, then we both get points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 clocks. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 2 papers and 0 clocks. But again, depends on their value. \n\nBut since I don't know their value, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe the best is to take the potatoes and some papers. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. That's my first message.\n",
