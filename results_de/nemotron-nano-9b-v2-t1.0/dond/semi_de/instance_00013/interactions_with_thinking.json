                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 4 papers, 2 clocks, and 2 potatoes. My secret value function is 1 for paper, 1 for clock, and 2 for potato. The goal is to get a high score by making a secret proposal that complements the other player's. \n\nFirst, I should think about what items are valuable to me. Potatoes are worth 2 each, so I really want those. Clocks are 1 each, and papers are 1 each. Since there are 2 potatoes, maybe I should aim to get both. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine. \n\nIf I propose to take both potatoes, then the other player might also want them. But if I can get both, that's 4 points. Then, maybe I can take some papers or clocks. But I need to check if the other player's proposal allows that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose something that leaves enough for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock, that's 2*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 7 points. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't take those items. \n\nWait, but the other player's value function is unknown. They might value different items. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe I should focus on the items I value most. \n\nSince potatoes are the highest value, I should definitely try to get both. Then, maybe take some papers or clocks. But I need to leave enough for the other player. Let me think about the total items. There are 4 papers, 2 clocks, 2 potatoes. \n\nIf I take both potatoes, that's 2. Then, maybe take 2 papers and 1 clock. That would leave 2 papers and 1 clock for the other player. If the other player's proposal is to take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, then that would be complementary. But I don't know their value function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That's 2*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 7. If the other player's proposal is to take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, then that's 2*1 + 1*1 = 3. But if their value function is different, maybe they would prefer different items. \n\nBut since I don't know their value function, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe the best approach is to propose taking the most valuable items for me, which are the potatoes. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. \n\nWait, but the format requires numbers and object names. So the exact format is [Proposal: <number> <object name>, ...]. So I need to write that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 papers. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 1 clock and 2 papers. But again, depends on their value. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. Maybe the first message is my secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...], and if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. \n\nSo my first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me decide what to propose. Since potatoes are worth 2 each, getting both would give me 4 points. Then, maybe take 2 papers (2 points) and 1 clock (1 point), totaling 7. That's a good deal. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't take those items. If they also want potatoes, then we might have a conflict. But if I can get both potatoes, that's a big win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That's 2*2 + 1*1 = 5. Then the other player could take 2 papers and 1 clock. But again, depends on their value. \n\nHmm. Since I don't know their value function, maybe the safest bet is to take the items I value most. So 2 potatoes, 2 papers, and 1 clock. That's 7 points. If the other player's proposal is to take the remaining 2 papers and 1 clock, then that's 2*1 + 1*1 = 3. But if their value function is different, maybe they would prefer other items. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 1 clock. That's 5 points. Then the other player could take 2 papers and 1 clock. But again, not sure. \n\nI think the key is to maximize my own value. So I should propose taking as many high-value items as possible. So 2 potatoes (4 points), 2 papers (2 points), and 1 clock (1 point). Total 7. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. If they propose something that doesn't conflict, then we both get points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 potatoes and 2 clocks. That's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6. Then the other player could take 2 papers and 0 clocks. But again, depends on their value. \n\nBut since I don't know their value, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Maybe the best is to take the potatoes and some papers. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 2 Potatoes, 2 Papers, 1 Clock]. That's my first message.\n",
