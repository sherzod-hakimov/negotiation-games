Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Teller, 1 Münze, 2 Süßigkeiten, 2 Zitronen\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nTeller: 0, Münze: 2, Süßigkeit: 4, Zitrone: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. The items available are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, and 2 lemons. My secret value function is plates: 0, coin: 2, candy: 4, lemon: 0. So, I value candies the most, then coins, and plates and lemons are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, so I have to assume they might value different items. Since I can't know their preferences, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain while trying to get a complementary proposal from them. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we each want don't overlap), we both get points based on our own valuations. Otherwise, we both get zero. So, my goal is to propose items that I value highly (candies and maybe the coin) and hope the other player proposes items they value that don't conflict with mine.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think about what I should propose. I want to get as many candies as possible because they're worth 4 each. There are 2 candies available. If I take both, that's 8 points. The coin is worth 2, so if I can get that too, that's 10. But maybe the other player also wants the coin. Alternatively, maybe they don't care about candies. \n\nBut since I don't know their preferences, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. If I propose taking both candies and the coin, that's 3 items. The other player might propose items they value. If they value plates or lemons, which I don't, then maybe their proposal doesn't conflict. For example, if they propose plates and lemons, which I don't care about, then our proposals would be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if they also want candies or the coin, then there's a conflict. But since I can't know, I should propose the items I value most. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Candies, 1 Coin]. That way, I get both candies (8 points) and the coin (2 points), totaling 10. If the other player's proposal doesn't include candies or the coin, then we both get points. \n\nBut wait, the other player might also want the coin. If they propose the coin, then we both can't have it. So maybe I should propose only the candies. Let me think. If I propose 2 candies, that's 8 points. If the other player proposes something else, like plates or lemons, then it's complementary. If they propose the coin, then we both can't have it. But since I value the coin, maybe I should include it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the coin more. But without knowing, it's a gamble. However, since I can only make a secret proposal once, I need to make it as strong as possible. \n\nAnother angle: the total items are 2 plates, 1 coin, 2 candies, 2 lemons. If I take 2 candies and 1 coin, that's 3 items. The remaining items are 2 plates and 2 lemons. If the other player proposes those, then it's complementary. But if they propose something else, like maybe 1 plate and 1 lemon, but that's not enough. Wait, the other player's proposal needs to be complementary. So if I take 2 candies and 1 coin, the other player would need to take the remaining items: 2 plates and 2 lemons. If they do that, then it's complementary. \n\nBut if the other player's proposal includes any of the candies or coin, then it's not complementary. So my proposal should be to take the candies and coin, and hope the other player takes the plates and lemons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the candies. If I take 2 candies, then the other player could take the coin, plates, and lemons. But if they take the coin, then I can't have it. But since I value the coin, maybe I should include it. \n\nBut if I propose both candies and coin, and the other player proposes plates and lemons, then it's complementary. That would be ideal. So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Candies, 1 Coin]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player might not want the coin. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the other player's value function is such that they value plates or lemons. If that's the case, then my proposal of candies and coin would be complementary. \n\nSo I think making a secret proposal of 2 candies and 1 coin is the best move. That way, if the other player's proposal is plates and lemons, we both get points. If they propose something else, maybe we don't. But since I can't know, this is the optimal strategy.\n",
