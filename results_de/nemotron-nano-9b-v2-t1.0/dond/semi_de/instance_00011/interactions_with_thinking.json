                    "content": "Okay, let's start. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. The items are 1 pot, 1 candy, 1 pipe, and 2 dice. My secret values are pot:2, candy:3, pipe:3, dice:1. So I value candy and pipe the most, then pot, then dice.\n\nThe goal is to make a secret proposal that, when combined with the other player's, covers all items. If our proposals are complementary, we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or maybe split the items in a way that both get high-value items.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. Candy and pipe are both 3 each. Pot is 2, dice 1. So I should aim to get candy and pipe. But there's only one of each. So if I take both, the other player might not get anything, but maybe they can take the pot and dice. But if I take candy and pipe, and the other player takes pot and both dice, that's complementary. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the dice. Since there are two dice, maybe each takes one. But dice are only worth 1 each. If I take one die, that's 1 point. The other player takes the other die, also 1. But maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, if I take both dice, but that's 2 points, but maybe the other player can take something else.\n\nWait, but the other player's values are unknown. So I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Let me think about possible proposals.\n\nIf I propose [Candy, Pipe], then the other player might propose [Pot, Dice, Dice]. That would be complementary. Then I get 3+3=6, they get 2+1+1=4. Total 10. That's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Candy, Pot], then the other player might take [Pipe, Dice, Dice]. Then I get 3+2=5, they get 3+1+1=5. Total 10. Also good.\n\nBut maybe the other player's values are different. For example, if they value pot more, they might take it. But since I don't know their values, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nAnother approach: since there are two dice, maybe splitting them. If I take one die, and the other takes the other. But that's 1 each. But if I take both, that's 2. But maybe the other player would prefer to take the pot and candy instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Candy, Pipe, Dice]. Then the other player would need to take [Pot, Dice]. That's complementary. I get 3+3+1=7, they get 2+1=3. Total 10. That's better for me.\n\nBut if the other player's proposal is [Pot, Candy], then my proposal would conflict. So I need to make sure my proposal is such that the other player's possible proposal can complement it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Candy, Pipe, Pot]. Then the other player would need to take [Dice, Dice]. That's complementary. I get 3+3+2=8, they get 1+1=2. Total 10. That's even better for me.\n\nBut again, depends on the other player's proposal. Since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Maybe the best is to take the highest value items for me, which are candy and pipe. So propose [Candy, Pipe]. Then the other player can take the remaining items: pot and both dice. That would be complementary. So I get 3+3=6, they get 2+1+1=4. Total 10.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Candy, Pipe, Dice], then the other player can take [Pot, Dice]. That's also complementary. I get 3+3+1=7, they get 2+1=3. Total 10. That's better for me.\n\nBut maybe the other player would prefer to take the pot and candy. If I take candy and pipe, they might take pot and dice. But if I take candy, pipe, and one die, then they take pot and the other die. That's still complementary.\n\nSo the key is to propose items that are high value for me, and leave the lower value items for the other player. Since dice are low value, maybe taking one or both is okay.\n\nAnother thought: if I propose [Candy, Pipe], and the other player proposes [Pot, Dice, Dice], that's complementary. If they propose [Pot, Candy], then my proposal would conflict. But since I don't know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Candy, Pipe, Pot]. Then the other player can take [Dice, Dice]. That's complementary. I get 3+3+2=8, they get 1+1=2. That's a good split.\n\nBut if the other player's proposal is [Candy, Pot], then my proposal would conflict. So I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player's possible proposal can complement it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Candy, Pipe, Dice]. Then the other player can take [Pot, Dice]. That's complementary. I get 3+3+1=7, they get 2+1=3. Total 10.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Candy, Pipe], and they propose [Pot, Dice, Dice], that's good. If they propose [Pot, Candy], then my proposal would conflict. But since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nAnother angle: since there are two dice, maybe splitting them. If I take one die, and they take the other. But that's 1 each. But if I take both, that's 2. But maybe the other player would prefer to take the pot and candy instead.\n\nSo, considering all this, the best proposal for me would be to take the highest value items: candy and pipe. So my secret proposal would be [Candy, Pipe]. That way, if the other player takes the pot and both dice, it's complementary. If they take something else, maybe not. But this seems like a solid proposal.\n\nAlternatively, if I take candy, pipe, and one die, that's 3+3+1=7. Then the other player can take pot and the other die. That's 2+1=3. Total 10. That's better for me.\n\nBut maybe the other player would prefer to take the pot and candy. If I take candy, pipe, and a die, then they can take pot and the other die. But if they take pot and candy, then my proposal would conflict. So I need to make sure that my proposal doesn't include items that the other player might want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Candy, Pipe, Pot]. Then the other player can take [Dice, Dice]. That's complementary. I get 3+3+2=8, they get 1+1=2. That's a good split.\n\nBut again, depends on their proposal. Since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. The key is to maximize my own value while ensuring that the other player's proposal can complement it.\n\nSo, considering all possibilities, the best proposal for me is to take candy, pipe, and maybe one die. But since dice are low value, maybe it's better to leave them for the other player. So [Candy, Pipe] is a good proposal. Alternatively, [Candy, Pipe, Pot] to get more points.\n\nBut if I take pot, that's 2, which is less than candy and pipe. So maybe [Candy, Pipe] is better. Let me go with that.\n"
