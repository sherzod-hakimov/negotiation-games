Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n4 Magnete, 1 Schaufel, 1 Blume\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nMagnet: 0, Schaufel: 2, Blume: 8\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

So the flower is super valuable to me, the shovel is moderately valuable, and magnets don't matter at all.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. But I need to make a secret proposal. The goal is to get as high a score as possible. Since the flower is worth 8 to me, I should definitely try to get that. The shovel is worth 2, so maybe I can get that too. The magnets are worthless to me, so maybe I can give them to the other player if needed.\n\nBut I need to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: number item, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think. If I propose to take the flower and the shovel, that would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]. But I need to check if that's possible. The other player might have a different proposal. But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to decide what to offer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the flower, since it's the most valuable. But if the other player also wants the flower, then we can't both get it. But if I propose the flower and the shovel, maybe the other player would accept if they can get the magnets. But I don't know their values. However, since I can't communicate except through secret proposals or messages, I need to make a strategic offer.\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items for both, then both get their items. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, doesn't exceed the available items.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I value the flower and shovel, I should propose those. The magnets are worthless to me, so maybe I can offer them to the other player. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the flower and the shovel, and hope the other player proposes the magnets. But if they don't, then we might not get a deal. But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to make it as attractive as possible.\n\nWait, the other player's secret values are unknown. But maybe I can assume that they might value the shovel or the flower as well. But since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain. Since the flower is worth 8, I should definitely get that. The shovel is 2, so getting that would add to my score. The magnets are 0, so giving them away doesn't hurt me.\n\nSo my secret proposal should be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 shovel]. That way, if the other player's proposal is the magnets, then we can both get our items. If the other player also wants the flower or shovel, then we might not get a deal. But since I can't communicate otherwise, this seems like the best bet. Alternatively, maybe I should propose just the flower, but then the shovel might be left for the other player. But if I can get both, that's better.\n\nAnother thought: if I propose the flower and the shovel, and the other player proposes the magnets, then we can both get our items. If the other player proposes something else, like the flower, then we can't both get it. But since I can't know, I have to make the best possible offer. So I think proposing the flower and shovel is the way to go.\n",
