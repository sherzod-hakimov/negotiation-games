                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on a split of the items. The items available are 3 pencils, 1 pen, and 2 nuts. My secret value function is pencils: 0, pen: 0, nuts: 5. So, I only care about nuts. The other player's values are unknown, but I need to consider possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value nuts as well, or maybe they prefer other items. But since my value for nuts is 5, I should prioritize getting as many nuts as possible.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don't exceed the available quantities), we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we get zero. So, the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, ensuring that our combined requests don't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. Maybe start by sending messages to gauge the other player's preferences. But since messages are public, I can't reveal my secret values. Alternatively, I could make a secret proposal early to lock in a deal.\n\nWait, the secret proposal is made in the format [Proposal: ...], and if both proposals are complementary, we get points. So, if I make a secret proposal, the other player might respond with their own. But if I don't make a secret proposal, I have to send messages to negotiate.\n\nBut the problem is that I don't know the other player's values. So, maybe the best approach is to propose taking all the nuts, since that's what I value. If the other player also values nuts, they might accept. If not, maybe they would take other items. But since I don't know, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my chances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the nuts and some other items that the other player might value. But since I don't know their values, it's risky. However, if I take all the nuts, that's 2 nuts. If the other player's proposal doesn't require more than 2 nuts, then it's complementary. But if they also want nuts, maybe they would take some, but I need to make sure that the total doesn't exceed 2.\n\nWait, the available nuts are 2. So, if I take 2 nuts, and the other player takes 0, that's fine. If they take 1, then total is 3, which is more than available. So, that would be non-complementary. So, I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don't exceed the available items.\n\nSo, if I propose taking 2 nuts, then the other player's proposal should not take any nuts. But if they propose taking 1 nut, then total is 3, which is over. So, that would result in zero points for both.\n\nTherefore, my secret proposal should be to take all 2 nuts. Then, if the other player's proposal doesn't take any nuts, we both get points. If they do take nuts, then we get zero. But since I don't know their values, maybe they would take nuts if they value them. But if they don't, then they might take other items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 1 nut and some other items. But since I don't value other items, that might not be optimal. However, if the other player values those items, they might accept. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAnother approach: since I can send messages, maybe I can ask the other player about their preferences. For example, \"Do you value nuts?\" But the problem is that messages are public, so if I ask that, they might reveal their value. But since I can't see their messages, maybe I can't get that info. Wait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, but I don't have access to their responses. So, I can't actually get information from their messages. So, I have to make assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that takes all the nuts. Let's say I propose [Proposal: 2 Nuts]. Then, if the other player's proposal doesn't include any nuts, we both get points. If they do include nuts, then we get zero. But if they value nuts, they might propose to take some, leading to a conflict. However, if they don't value nuts, they might propose to take other items, which would be complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, this is a risk. However, given that my value for nuts is 5, it's better to try to get them. If the other player's proposal is to take, say, 1 pen and 1 pencil, then my proposal of 2 nuts would be complementary, and I get 2*5=10 points. If they propose to take 1 nut, then we can't both have it, so zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 nut and 1 pencil. But since I don't value pencils, that's not helpful. But maybe the other player values pencils, so they might accept. But again, without knowing, it's uncertain.\n\nAnother thought: since I can send up to 5 messages, maybe I can send multiple messages to negotiate. For example, first message: \"I value nuts the most. Do you want to take some?\" But again, the other player might not respond in a way that helps me. Since I can't see their messages, I can't adjust my strategy based on their responses. So, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that takes 2 nuts and 1 pen. But why the pen? If the other player values the pen, they might accept. But if they don't, they might take other items. However, since I don't value the pen, it's a risk. But if I take the pen, maybe the other player would take the pencils, which I don't care about. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, the available items are 3 pencils, 1 pen, 2 nuts. So, if I take 2 nuts and 1 pen, that's 3 items. The other player could take 3 pencils. That would be complementary. So, in that case, I get 2*5 + 1*0 = 10 points. The other player gets 3* their value for pencils. If their value for pencils is positive, they get some points. But if their value for pencils is zero, they get zero. But since I don't know, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 nuts and 0 other items, then the other player can take 3 pencils and 1 pen. That would be complementary. So, I get 10 points, and they get whatever they value in pencils and pen. But if they value pencils or pen, they get points. If not, they get zero. But since I don't know, it's a risk.\n\nBut since my goal is to maximize my own score, I should focus on getting the nuts. So, the best proposal is to take all 2 nuts. Then, if the other player's proposal doesn't take any nuts, we both get points. If they do take nuts, we get zero. But if they don't value nuts, they might take other items, which would be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 nut and 1 pen. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to tell. However, if I take 1 nut, then the other player could take 1 nut, leading to a conflict. But if I take 2 nuts, they can't take any, so that's safer.\n\nSo, the optimal secret proposal would be to take 2 nuts. That way, if the other player's proposal doesn't include nuts, we both get points. If they do, we get zero. But since I don't know their values, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose to take 1 nut and 1 pencil. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. However, if they value pencils, they might accept. But since I don't value pencils, it's not beneficial for me. So, better to focus on nuts.\n\nTherefore, I should make a secret proposal to take 2 nuts. That's the best I can do given my value function.\n"
