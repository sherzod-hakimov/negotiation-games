Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Schüssel, 1 Flasche, 2 Früchte, 1 Radiergummi\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nSchüssel: 5, Flasche: 5, Frucht: 0, Radiergummi: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format.

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on a division of items. The items available are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, and 1 eraser. My secret value function is bowl:5, bottle:5, fruit:0, eraser:0. So I really want the bowl and bottle, and the fruits and eraser don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. But since I can't see theirs, I have to make assumptions or try to find a mutually beneficial split. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), we both get the sum of our values for the items we get. Otherwise, we both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might not want, or vice versa.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I should start by trying to communicate my preferences. But since messages are public, I need to be careful not to reveal too much. However, the secret proposal is the only way to lock in an agreement. \n\nFirst, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But what should I propose? If I propose taking the bowl and bottle, that's 10 points for me. But if the other player also wants those, then our proposals would conflict, leading to zero. Alternatively, if I propose the bowl and bottle, and the other player proposes the fruits and eraser, then we can split them. But since fruits and eraser are worthless to me, maybe the other player might want them. But I don't know their values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and hope the other player doesn't want them. But if they do, then we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe I can propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose something else. But since I can't know, maybe I should make a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, we both get the sum. So if I make a secret proposal, and the other player makes a complementary one, we both get points. But if I make a secret proposal, and they don't, then we both get zero. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but maybe more to them. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose something else. But if they do want them, then we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose the fruits and eraser. But since fruits and eraser are worthless to me, maybe they would want them. But again, I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of the bowl and bottle. If the other player's proposal is complementary, then we both get 10 points. If not, zero. But if I don't make a secret proposal, maybe we can negotiate through messages. \n\nBut the problem is that messages are public. So if I send a message saying I want the bowl and bottle, the other player can see that and might adjust their proposal. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of [Bowl, Bottle], then if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get 10. If not, zero. But if I don't make a secret proposal, maybe we can negotiate. \n\nBut since the other player's values are unknown, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that maximizes my own value, assuming that the other player might not want those items. For example, if I propose the bowl and bottle, and the other player's values for those are low, then they might propose something else. But if they do want them, then we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose the fruits and eraser. But since fruits and eraser are worthless to me, maybe they would want them. But again, I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose the fruits. But since there are two fruits, maybe they can take both. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of the bowl and bottle. Let me try that. So my secret proposal would be [Bowl, Bottle]. Then, if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get 10. If not, zero. \n\nBut maybe the other player's secret values are such that they also want the bowl and bottle. In that case, we both get zero. But if they don't, then we get 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose the fruits and eraser. But since I don't care about those, maybe they would. \n\nBut without knowing their values, it's a gamble. However, since my value for bowl and bottle is high, it's better to take them if possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose something else. But since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should make the secret proposal first. \n\nSo the first step is to make a secret proposal. Let me do that. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Since I want bowl and bottle, I can propose [Proposal: 1 Bowl, 1 Bottle]. \n\nBut wait, the items are 1 bowl, 1 bottle, 2 fruits, 1 eraser. So the numbers would be 1, 1, 2, 1. But in the proposal, do I need to specify the quantity? The example given in the rules is [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So for example, if I want 1 bowl and 1 bottle, it would be [Proposal: 1 Bowl, 1 Bottle]. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Bowl, 1 Bottle]. \n\nIf the other player's proposal is complementary, meaning they don't take those items, then we both get 10. If they also take bowl or bottle, then we get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose the fruits and eraser. But since I don't care about those, maybe they would. \n\nBut since I can't know, making the secret proposal of bowl and bottle is my best bet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message first. For example, \"I want the bowl and bottle. What do you want?\" But since messages are public, the other player can see that and might adjust. But if I make a secret proposal, it's hidden. \n\nBut the problem is that if I make a secret proposal, and the other player doesn't make a complementary one, we both get zero. So maybe it's better to make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if the other player's proposal is not complementary, then we can try to adjust. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal of the bowl and bottle. Let me go with that. So my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Bowl, 1 Bottle]. \n\nThen, depending on the other player's response, I can adjust. But since I can't see their proposal, I have to wait. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message first. For example, \"I'm willing to take the bowl and bottle. What about you?\" But that's a public message. The other player can see that and might propose something else. \n\nBut if I make a secret proposal, it's hidden. So maybe that's better. \n\nSo I think the best first move is to make a secret proposal of the bowl and bottle. That way, if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get 10. If not, zero. \n\nBut maybe the other player's values are such that they also want the bowl and bottle. In that case, we both get zero. But if they don't, then we get 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the bowl and bottle, and if they don't want them, they might propose the fruits and eraser. But since I don't care about those, maybe they would. \n\nBut without knowing, it's a risk. However, since my value for bowl and bottle is high, it's worth taking the risk. \n\nSo I'll proceed to make the secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 Bowl, 1 Bottle].\n",
