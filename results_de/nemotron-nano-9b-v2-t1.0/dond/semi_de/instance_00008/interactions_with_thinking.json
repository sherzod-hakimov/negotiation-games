                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by agreeing on how to split the items. The items available are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, and 1 shell. My secret value function is shovel: 0, picture: 0, shell: 10. So the shell is super valuable to me, but the other items don't matter. \n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I don't know. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. If I want to maximize my score, I need to get the shell. But if the other player also wants the shell, we might have a conflict. \n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, ensuring that our combined proposals don't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I value the shell at 10, I should definitely try to get it. But if I propose taking the shell, the other player might also propose taking it, leading to a conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items that the other player might not care about. But since my other items have zero value, maybe I should focus on the shell.\n\nWait, but if I propose taking the shell, and the other player also proposes taking it, then we can't both have it. So that would result in zero points. So maybe I need to propose something else. But if I don't take the shell, I get zero. So maybe I should take the shell and see if the other player is willing to give it up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the shell less. But since I don't know their value function, I have to make an assumption. Maybe they also value the shell highly. \n\nAnother approach: since I have zero value for shovels and pictures, maybe I can propose taking all the shovels and pictures, leaving the shell for the other player. But if the other player also wants the shell, that might not work. \n\nWait, but if I propose taking all the shovels and pictures, and the other player proposes taking the shell, then our proposals would be complementary. Because the items are 3 shovels, 2 pictures, 1 shell. If I take all shovels and pictures, and the other takes the shell, that's possible. Then I get 0 (since I don't value shovels or pictures) and the other gets 10. But that's bad for me. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose taking the shell, and the other player proposes taking something else. But if they don't want the shell, maybe they would accept. But again, without knowing their value function, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a secret proposal. The rules say that a secret proposal is made in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe I should make a secret proposal to take the shell. But if the other player also makes a secret proposal, then we have to check if they are complementary. \n\nBut the problem is that if both make secret proposals, we need to see if they are complementary. If they are, then we both get points. If not, zero. \n\nSo maybe the best strategy is to make a secret proposal to take the shell. Because if the other player also wants it, we might have a conflict. But if they don't, then I get the shell and they get nothing. But if they also propose the shell, then we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and some other items. But since I don't value the others, maybe that's not helpful. \n\nWait, but if I propose taking the shell, and the other player proposes taking something else, then our proposals are complementary. For example, if I take the shell, and they take the shovels and pictures, then that's possible. But if they also want the shell, then it's a conflict. \n\nBut since I don't know their value function, maybe the safest bet is to propose taking the shell. Because if they don't want it, I get it. If they do, then we might have a conflict. But maybe the other player's value function is such that they don't value the shell as much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking nothing, but that would give me zero. Not good. \n\nAnother thought: since the shell is the only item I value, maybe I should try to get it. So my first message should be a secret proposal to take the shell. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So I need to format it correctly. \n\nSo my first message would be: [Proposal: 1 Shell]. That's my secret proposal. Then the other player would respond. If they also make a secret proposal, we check if they are complementary. If they propose something else, then we can have a complementary split. \n\nBut if they also propose the shell, then we can't both have it. So that would result in zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a non-secret message first, but the rules say that non-secret messages are sent directly. But the user hasn't provided any previous messages. So maybe I should start with a secret proposal. \n\nWait, the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to make my first move. Since I value the shell, I should propose taking it. So my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Shell]. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the format is correct. The example given is [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So numbers are required. Maybe the numbers are the quantity? Or maybe they are just identifiers. The problem statement isn't clear. But the example shows numbers, so I should include them. \n\nSo maybe [Proposal: 1 Shell]. That's my first move. Then the other player would respond. If they accept, then we both get points. If not, maybe we have to negotiate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the shell and some other items. But since I don't value them, it's not necessary. \n\nAnother angle: since the other player's value function is secret, maybe they also value the shell. If that's the case, then we need to find a way to split the items so that both get something. But since I only value the shell, maybe I should take it and give the rest to the other player. But if the other player also wants the shell, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose taking the shell and the other player proposes taking the shovels and pictures. Then we can have a complementary split. But again, without knowing their value function, it's a gamble. \n\nBut given that I have to make a move, the best I can do is propose the shell. So I'll go with that.\n"
