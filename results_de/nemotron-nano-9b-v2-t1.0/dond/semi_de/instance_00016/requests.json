Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n3 Vasen, 1 Stuhl, 1 Draht\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nVase: 2, Stuhl: 3, Draht: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein.

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 3 vases, 1 stool, and 1 wire. My secret value function is Vase: 2, Stool: 3, Wire: 1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to get a high score by making a secret proposal that complements the other's, so both get points.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The stool is worth 3, which is the highest. Then vases at 2 each, and wire at 1. Since there are 3 vases, maybe splitting them could be beneficial. But I need to think about what the other player might value. If they value the stool highly, maybe I should offer it to them in exchange for something else. But since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items can be divided without overlap), both get points. Otherwise, both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might also want, but in a way that there's enough for both. Wait, no. The proposals need to be complementary, meaning that the items in both proposals don't overlap. So if I propose some items, the other player's proposal should take the remaining items. But since we don't know each other's values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly, hoping the other player also values them, but that might not work. Or maybe propose items that I value less but the other might value more. But without knowing their values, it's a bit of a gamble.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose items that I think the other player might also want. For example, if I propose the stool, maybe the other player also values it, but if they do, then my proposal would conflict. Wait, no. If I propose the stool, and the other player also proposes the stool, then they can't both have it. So that would result in zero points. So maybe I should avoid proposing items that are likely to be in high demand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but could be more valuable to the other. For example, the wire is only worth 1 to me, but maybe the other player values it more. If I propose the wire, and they also propose it, then again, conflict. But if I propose the wire and they don't, then I get it. But since I don't know their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose a combination. For example, propose 2 vases and the wire. That way, I get 2*2 +1 =5 points. If the other player's proposal is the remaining 1 vase and the stool, then they get 2 +3=5. That would be a good split. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is complementary. So if I propose 2 vases and wire, the other would need to propose 1 vase and stool. But I don't know if they would do that. However, since I have to make a secret proposal, I have to choose based on my own values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the stool and one vase. That would give me 3+2=5. If the other player's proposal is 2 vases and wire, then they get 4+1=5. That's also good. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my expected value. Maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, but in a way that leaves enough for the other player. For example, if I take the stool and one vase, leaving 2 vases and the wire. If the other player values the remaining items, that could work. But if they value the stool more, they might not accept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the wire and one vase. That's 1+2=3. If the other player takes the stool and two vases, they get 3+4=7. But again, depends on their values.\n\nWait, but the key is that both proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose certain items, the other player's proposal must not include any of those items. So if I propose the stool, the other player can't propose the stool. Similarly for vases and wire.\n\nSo maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be in high demand. For example, the wire is only one, so if I propose it, the other player can't. But if I don't propose it, maybe they will. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the stool and the wire. That's 3+1=4. If the other player proposes 3 vases, they get 6. That's a good split. But if they don't value the stool or wire, they might not accept. But since I have to make a secret proposal, I have to choose based on my own values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 3 vases. That's 6 points. If the other player proposes the stool and wire, they get 3+1=4. That's a good split. But if they don't value the stool or wire, they might not accept. But again, I don't know.\n\nBut since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose the best possible one. Given that the stool is the most valuable to me, maybe I should propose the stool. But if I do that, the other player can't propose it. So if they also value the stool, they might not accept. But if they don't, then I get the stool and maybe other items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 2 vases and the stool. That's 2*2 +3=7. If the other player proposes 1 vase and wire, they get 2+1=3. That's a good split. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the safest bet is to propose the items I value the most, which are the stool and vases.

But if they don't value the stool, they might not accept. However, since I have to make a secret proposal, I have to go with what I know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose 1 vase and the stool. That's 2+3=5. If the other player takes 2 vases and wire, they get 4+1=5. That's a balanced split. That might be a good proposal because it's a fair division. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving enough for the other.

Since the stool is the most valuable to me, I should probably include it in my proposal. So maybe propose the stool and one vase. That way, I get 5 points. If the other player's proposal is 2 vases and wire, they get 5. That's a good outcome. Alternatively, if they propose something else, but I can't know.\n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Stool, 1 Vase]. That's 3+2=5. If the other player's proposal is 2 vases and wire, then it's complementary. If not, then we both get zero. But since I can't know, this is a calculated risk.\n",
