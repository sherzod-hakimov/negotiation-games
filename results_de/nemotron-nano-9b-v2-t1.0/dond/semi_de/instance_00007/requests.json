Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Drähte, 2 Gläser, 2 Nadeln, 2 Tassen\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nDraht: 1, Glas: 0, Nadel: 0, Tasse: 4\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items with the other player. The items are 2 wires, 2 glasses, 2 nails, and 2 cups. My secret value function is: wire is 1, glass 0, nail 0, cup 4. So I really want the cups, and the wires are somewhat valuable, but the others don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, so I have to assume they might value different items. Since I can't know their preferences, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own score while considering possible overlaps. The key is to get as many cups as possible because they're worth 4 each. There are two cups, so if I can get both, that's 8 points. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict with mine.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., all items are covered without overlap), we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, we get zero. So I need to propose items in a way that the other player's proposal can complement mine. But since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should focus on items that are less valuable to them but valuable to me. Wait, but I don't know their values. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that I value highly and hope the other player doesn't need them. For example, cups are worth 4 to me. If I propose both cups, maybe the other player might not want them, allowing me to get both. But if they also value cups, then their proposal might include cups, leading to a conflict. But since I can't know, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. Wait, but I don't know their values. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, which are the cups. Let me try that.\n\nSo my first proposal would be to take both cups. The format is [Proposal: 1 Cup, 1 Cup]. But wait, the items are 2 cups. So maybe I should specify both. But the format is numbers and object names. So maybe [Proposal: 2 Cup]. But the example in the rules shows multiple items with numbers. So perhaps [Proposal: 2 Cup]. That would mean I want both cups. Then, if the other player's proposal doesn't include cups, we can both get them. But if they do, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose one cup and some other items. But since cups are my highest value, I should prioritize getting both. Let me think. If I propose both cups, and the other player's proposal doesn't include cups, then we can both get them. But if they do, then we can't. But since I don't know their preferences, maybe I should propose both cups and see. If they respond with a proposal that doesn't include cups, then we can both get them. If they do, then we have to negotiate.\n\nBut the problem is that I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal. So I need to make a secret proposal first. Let me start with that. My secret proposal would be to take both cups. So the message would be [Proposal: 2 Cup]. That's my first move. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust. But since I can't see their response, I have to make the best possible proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should propose cups and some other items that I don't care about, like wires or glasses, to make the proposal more comprehensive. But since I don't know their values, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the other player's value function is secret. So maybe they value something else. For example, if they value wires, then proposing cups might not be enough. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain. So the best bet is to take the cups. Let me go with that. So my first secret proposal is [Proposal: 2 Cup]. That's my first message. Then, if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get the cups. If not, we get zero. But maybe the other player's proposal includes cups, leading to a conflict. But without knowing their values, I can't be sure. However, since cups are my highest value, I should prioritize getting them. So I'll make that proposal.\n",
