Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Stock, 1 Handtuch, 1 Spielzeug, 2 Kisten\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nStock: 5, Handtuch: 2, Spielzeug: 1, Kiste: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's start. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of items with the other player. The items are 1 Stock, 1 Towel, 1 Toy, and 2 Boxes. My values are Stock:5, Towel:2, Toy:1, Box:1. The other player's values are unknown, but I need to make a secret proposal that maximizes my score.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The Stock is worth 5, which is the highest. Then Towel is 2, Toy and Boxes are 1 each. Since there are two Boxes, maybe splitting them could be beneficial. But I need to think about what the other player might value. If they value Stock highly too, then maybe we should both try to get it. But since it's only one Stock, we can't both have it. So maybe I should propose taking the Stock, and then see if the other player can get other items. Alternatively, maybe I can propose items that I value less but the other player might value more, to get a better deal.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the best approach is to propose the items I value the most, and see if the other player can accept. If they can't, maybe we can negotiate. But since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to be efficient.\n\nThe secret proposal format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. Let me think: if I take the Stock (5 points), that's the best. Then maybe the Towel (2 points). But if the other player also wants the Stock, they might not accept. Alternatively, maybe I can propose the Stock and some other items. But if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo maybe my first secret proposal should be the Stock and the Towel. That would give me 5+2=7 points. But if the other player's proposal doesn't include those, then we get zero. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Stock and the Boxes. But Boxes are only 1 each, so 2 points. But if the other player also wants the Stock, they might not accept. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the Stock and the Toy. But the Toy is only 1 point. Not as good. Or maybe the Stock and one Box. But again, 5+1=6. Not as good as 7.\n\nWait, but the other player's proposal needs to be complementary. So if I propose Stock and Towel, the other player's proposal should not include those items. But if they propose something else, like the Toy and Boxes, then we can both get our items. But if they also propose Stock, then it's a conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the safest bet is to propose the items I value the most. So Stock and Towel. Let me make that my secret proposal. If the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But maybe the other player would prefer to take the Stock, so they might not accept my proposal. Alternatively, maybe they have different values. For example, if they value the Towel more than the Stock, they might accept my proposal. But I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the Stock and the Boxes. That's 5+1+1=7 points. But again, same as before. Or maybe just the Stock. But that's 5 points. Maybe that's better if the other player can't get the Stock. But I need to think about the possible scenarios.\n\nAnother approach: since there are two Boxes, maybe splitting them could be a way to get more points. If I take one Box and the other takes the other, but since they are both worth 1, that's 1 each. But if I can get the Stock and a Box, that's 6. But again, depends on the other player's proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the Stock and the Towel, and if the other player can't get those, they might propose something else. But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the best one. Maybe the best is to take the Stock and the Towel. Let me go with that.\n",
