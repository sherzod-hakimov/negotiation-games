                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 3 candies, 2 fruits, and 1 hat. My secret value function is candies worth 2 each, fruits 2 each, and hats 0. So hats don't matter to me. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. The goal is to get a high score by having complementary proposals.\n\nFirst, I should think about what items are valuable to me. Since candies and fruits are both worth 2, I should aim to get as many of those as possible. The hat is worthless to me, so maybe I can give that to the other player if it helps in making a complementary proposal.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the total items requested by both don't exceed the available quantities), then we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we get zero. So I need to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, doesn't exceed the available items.\n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. Maybe start by sending a message to the other player to gauge their preferences. But since I can't see their values, I have to make assumptions. Alternatively, I could make a secret proposal that maximizes my own gain while leaving enough items for the other player to possibly accept.\n\nLet me consider possible proposals. If I take all 3 candies and 2 fruits, that's 5 items. But the other player might need some items too. However, if I take all the candies and fruits, the other player might not have enough to make a complementary proposal. Alternatively, maybe I should leave some items for them.\n\nWait, the hat is only 1. If I take the hat, it's worthless to me, but maybe the other player values it. But since I don't know their values, it's risky. Maybe better to leave the hat for them if they might value it.\n\nSo, possible proposal: [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. That uses all the candies and fruits. Then the other player would need to propose something that doesn't require any candies or fruits. But they have 1 hat. If they propose the hat, then our proposals would be complementary. But if they propose something else, maybe they need more items. However, since they have their own values, maybe they would want the hat. But if I take all the candies and fruits, and they take the hat, that's complementary. But if they don't want the hat, maybe they would propose something else, but there are no other items. So maybe that's a good proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 2 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 candy and 1 fruit for the other player. That way, there's more flexibility. But I need to think about what the other player might want. Since I don't know their values, it's hard. But if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, that's 3 items. The other player could take 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. But if their values are different, maybe they would prefer different items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the hat. But since the hat is worthless to me, maybe I should not include it. But if the other player values it, they might need it. However, if I don't take it, they can take it. But if I take it, it doesn't affect my score. So maybe it's better to leave the hat for them.\n\nSo my initial proposal could be [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. Then, if the other player's proposal is [Proposal: 1 Hat], then it's complementary. But if they propose something else, like taking some candies or fruits, then it might not be complementary. But since I don't know their values, I have to make a best guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask about their preferences. For example, \"Do you value the hat more than candies or fruits?\" But according to the rules, messages are sent directly, and I can't add extra text. So I need to be careful with my messages. Maybe I can send a message like \"I'm considering taking all candies and fruits. What do you think?\" But again, the exact wording isn't specified, but the key is that messages are sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that is likely to be complementary. For example, if I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, and the other player takes 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. That would be complementary. But again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAnother approach: since the hat is worthless to me, I can offer it to the other player. So my proposal could be [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits, 1 Hat]. But that would use all items. However, if the other player's proposal is empty, then it's not complementary. But if they propose nothing, then it's not complementary. Alternatively, if they propose something else, maybe they need the hat. But if I take the hat, they can't. So maybe it's better to not take the hat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking 3 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 fruit and the hat. Then the other player could take the remaining fruit and hat. But again, depends on their values.\n\nThis is tricky. Since I don't know the other player's values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain while leaving enough items for them to possibly accept. Since candies and fruits are both valuable to me, I should prioritize those. The hat is not, so I can give it away if needed.\n\nSo my first message could be a secret proposal: [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. That way, I get all the valuable items. If the other player's proposal is just the hat, then it's complementary. If they propose something else, like taking some candies or fruits, then it might not be. But if they don't have a proposal that complements mine, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a more balanced proposal. For example, [Proposal: 2 Candies, 1 Fruit]. Then the other player could take 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. That would be complementary. But again, without knowing their values, it's uncertain.\n\nBut since my goal is to maximize my own score, I should take as many high-value items as possible. So taking all 3 candies and 2 fruits would give me 3*2 + 2*2 = 10 points. If the other player takes the hat, which is 0 for me, but maybe they get some value. But since I don't know their values, I can't be sure. However, if I take all the candies and fruits, and they take the hat, that's a complementary proposal. So that's a possible outcome.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 3 candies and 1 fruit, leaving 1 fruit and the hat. Then the other player could take 1 fruit and the hat. That would be complementary. My score would be 3*2 + 1*2 = 8. But if I take all, it's 10. So better to take all.\n\nBut the problem is that if the other player's proposal doesn't complement mine, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal is such that there's a possibility of a complementary proposal. If I take all the candies and fruits, the only item left is the hat. So the other player's proposal would need to be the hat. If they do that, then it's complementary. If they propose something else, like taking some candies or fruits, then it's not. But since I don't know their values, maybe they would prefer the hat. But if they don't, then we both get zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes the hat. For example, [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits, 1 Hat]. But that would use all items. Then the other player's proposal would have to be empty, which isn't possible. So that's not complementary. So that's bad.\n\nSo the best bet is to take all the candies and fruits, and hope the other player takes the hat. If they do, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But since I don't know their values, it's a gamble. However, given that the hat is worthless to me, I can afford to give it away if needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask if they want the hat. But according to the rules, messages are sent directly, and I can't add extra text. So I need to be precise. Maybe I can send a message like \"I'm taking all candies and fruits. Do you want the hat?\" But the exact wording isn't specified, but the key is that messages are sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the hat. But since it's worthless to me, it's better to not include it. So my initial proposal is [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. Then, if the other player's proposal is [Proposal: 1 Hat], it's complementary. If they propose something else, like taking some candies or fruits, then it's not. But since I don't know their values, I have to take the risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that leaves some items for the other player. For example, [Proposal: 2 Candies, 1 Fruit]. Then the other player could take 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat. That would be complementary. My score would be 2*2 + 1*2 = 6. But if I take all, it's 10. So better to take all.\n\nBut again, the risk is that if the other player doesn't take the hat, then we both get zero. But if they do, then I get 10. So it's a 50-50 chance? Not sure. But since I can't know, maybe taking all is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to suggest a split. For example, \"Let's split the candies and fruits. I'll take 2 candies and 1 fruit, you take 1 candy and 1 fruit, and the hat.\" But again, the exact message isn't specified, but the key is that messages are sent to the other player. However, the problem says that messages are sent directly, so I need to make sure that my messages are clear.\n\nBut according to the rules, the secret proposal is in the specific format. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits], then the other player might respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is [Proposal: 1 Hat], then it's complementary. If not, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, I have to assume that they might value the hat. But if they don't, then it's a loss.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes the hat. But since it's worthless to me, it's better to not include it. So I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal of taking all the candies and fruits. That way, if the other player takes the hat, we both get points. If not, we get zero. But since I can't know, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask if they want the hat. But according to the rules, messages are sent directly, and I can't add extra text. So I need to be careful. Maybe I can send a message like \"I'm taking all candies and fruits. Do you want the hat?\" But the exact wording isn't specified, but the key is that messages are sent to the other player. However, the problem says that messages are sent directly, so I need to make sure that my messages are clear.\n\nBut since I can only send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to decide whether to send messages or make a secret proposal. If I make a secret proposal, it's a one-time action. If I send messages, I can have multiple exchanges.\n\nBut the problem says that I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe I should start by sending a message to the other player to discuss. For example, \"What are your preferences for the items?\" But again, the exact message isn't specified, but the key is that messages are sent to the other player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits], then the other player might respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is [Proposal: 1 Hat], then it's complementary. If not, then we both get zero. But since I don't know their values, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to suggest a split. For example, \"Let's agree that I take 2 candies and 1 fruit, and you take 1 candy, 1 fruit, and the hat.\" But again, the exact message isn't specified, but the key is that messages are sent to the other player.\n\nBut according to the rules, the secret proposal is in the specific format. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that maximizes my own gain while leaving enough items for the other player. Since the hat is worthless to me, I can give it to them. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits]. Then, if the other player's proposal is [Proposal: 1 Hat], it's complementary. If they propose something else, like taking some candies or fruits, then it's not. But since I don't know their values, I have to take the risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a proposal that includes the hat. For example, [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits, 1 Hat]. But that would use all items. Then the other player's proposal would have to be empty, which isn't possible. So that's not complementary. So that's bad.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to take all the candies and fruits, and hope the other player takes the hat. So my first action is to make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 3 Candies, 2 Fruits].\n"
