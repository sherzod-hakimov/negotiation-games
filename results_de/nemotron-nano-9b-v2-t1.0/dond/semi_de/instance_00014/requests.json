Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Rahmen, 1 Schuh, 3 Hämmer\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nRahmen: 8, Schuh: 2, Hammer: 0\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

So I really want the frame, the shoe is okay but not super important, and hammers are worthless to me. The other player's values are unknown, but I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nThe rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don't overlap in items), we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we both get zero. So I need to propose items that the other player might also want, but since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nSince I value the frame highly (8 points), I should definitely try to get that. The shoe is worth 2, so maybe the other player also values it. Hammers are worthless to me, so maybe they are more valuable to the other player. But I don't know. \n\nIn the first message, I should probably start by proposing the frame and maybe the shoe. If the other player also wants those, then we can split them. But if they don't, maybe they'll counter with hammers. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers, but since hammers are worthless to me, that might not be good. Wait, but if I propose the frame and hammers, and the other player also wants hammers, then maybe that's a way to split. But since I don't care about hammers, maybe I should avoid proposing them unless necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values hammers more. So if I propose the frame and shoe, and they propose hammers, then we can split. But if they also want the frame, then we have a conflict. \n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages, I need to strategize. The first message should be a proposal. Let me think: if I propose the frame and shoe, that's two items. The other player might accept if they also want those. If they don't, they might propose something else. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers. But since hammers are worthless to me, maybe that's not good. Unless the other player really wants hammers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and leave the shoe and hammers for the other player. But that might not be optimal. \n\nWait, the key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So if I propose the frame and shoe, and the other player proposes the hammers, then that's complementary. But if they propose the frame as well, then it's not. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Since I value the frame highly, I should definitely include it in my proposal. The shoe is a maybe. Hammers are not valuable to me. \n\nSo my first proposal could be [Proposal: 1 Frame, 1 Shoe]. That way, if the other player also wants those, we can split. If they don't, they might propose something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the frame. But then the other player might take the shoe and hammers. But if I propose the frame and shoe, maybe that's better. \n\nAnother thought: since the other player's values are secret, maybe they also value the frame. If I propose the frame, they might accept. But if they also want the frame, then we have a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and some hammers. But since hammers are worthless to me, that's not good. Unless the other player really wants hammers. \n\nBut without knowing their values, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the frame and the shoe, and if they accept, great. If not, maybe they'll propose hammers. \n\nSo my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me check the format: [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. \n\nSo my first proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Frame, 1 Shoe]. That's two items. If the other player's proposal is complementary, like 3 hammers, then we both get points. If they also want the frame or shoe, then it's not complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose just the frame. But then the other player might take the shoe and hammers. But if they also want the frame, then we can't split. \n\nBut since I value the frame so much, I need to get it. So proposing the frame is essential. \n\nSo I think the best first move is to propose the frame and shoe. Let me go with that.\n",
