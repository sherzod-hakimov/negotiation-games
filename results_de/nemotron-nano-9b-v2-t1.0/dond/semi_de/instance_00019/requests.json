Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, eine möglichst hohe Punktzahl zu erreichen.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Fäden, 3 Bolzen, 1 Bild\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nFaden: 0, Bolzen: 1, Bild: 7\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

The items available are 2 threads, 3 nuts, and 1 picture. My secret value function is threads: 0, nuts: 1, picture: 7. So the picture is super valuable to me, threads don't matter, and nuts are worth 1 each.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The key is to find a complementary proposal where both get enough items. If we can't agree, both get zero. So I need to propose something that the other player would accept, and vice versa.\n\nSince the picture is worth 7 to me, I should definitely try to get that. But if I take the picture, the other player might not want to give up anything else. Alternatively, maybe they value the picture less. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. However, since the picture is the highest value item for me, I should prioritize getting it.\n\nThe other items are threads (which I don't care about) and nuts (which I value at 1 each). If I can get the picture and some nuts, that would be good. But I need to make sure the other player also gets enough. Let's think about possible proposals.\n\nIf I propose taking the picture and maybe some nuts, but the other player might need to take the rest. For example, if I take the picture and 2 nuts, then the other player would need to take the remaining 1 nut and 2 threads. But if the other player values nuts more than me, they might not accept that. Alternatively, if I take the picture and all 3 nuts, then the other player gets 2 threads. But if they don't value threads, they might not accept. However, since threads are worth 0 to me, maybe they value them more. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the picture less. If I can get the picture and some nuts, and they get the rest. But I need to make a proposal that's acceptable. Since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nThe first step is to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I should start by proposing something. Let me think. If I propose taking the picture and 3 nuts, that would be [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 nuts]. Then the other player would have to take 2 threads. If they accept, I get 7 + 3*1 = 10 points. But if they don't accept, we both get zero. Alternatively, maybe they would prefer to take the picture and some nuts. But without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 1 nut, leaving 2 nuts and 2 threads for the other player. If they value nuts, they might accept. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 2 nuts, leaving 1 nut and 2 threads. If the other player values nuts, they might take that. But if they don't, they might not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 0 nuts, just the picture. Then the other player would have to take 3 nuts and 2 threads. If they value nuts, that's 3 points. But if they don't, they might not accept. But since I don't know their values, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 3 nuts, and see if they accept. If they do, great. If not, maybe I can adjust in subsequent messages.\n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be strategic. Let me start with the first proposal. I'll go with [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 nuts]. That's my best bet because the picture is worth 7, and 3 nuts give me 3 points. If the other player accepts, I get 10. If not, maybe I can try another proposal.\n\nBut wait, the other player might not want to give up the nuts. Maybe they value nuts more. For example, if their value function is nuts: 5, then they would prefer to keep the nuts. But since I don't know, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the picture and 1 nut, leaving 2 nuts and 2 threads. If the other player values nuts, they might take 2 nuts and 2 threads. But again, it's uncertain.\n\nAnother angle: since threads are worth 0 to me, maybe the other player values them. If I can get the picture and some nuts, and they get the threads, that might work. But I need to make sure their proposal is complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's value function is such that they value the picture less. For example, if their picture is worth 1, then they might be willing to give it up for nuts. But again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nIn any case, the first step is to make a secret proposal. I think the best move is to propose taking the picture and as many nuts as possible. So [Proposal: 1 picture, 3 nuts]. Let's go with that.\n",
