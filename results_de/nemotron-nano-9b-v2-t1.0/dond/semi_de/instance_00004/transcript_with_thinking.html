    <div speaker="Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer) to Player 1 (DealOrNoDealPlayer)" class="msg player-player p1" style="">
        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to negotiate the division of these items: 1 Orange, 1 Paprika, and 3 Pictures. My secret value function is Orange:5, Paprika:2, Picture:1. The goal is to get as high a score as possible by making a secret proposal that complements the other player&#x27;s.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what items are valuable to me. The Orange is worth 5, which is the highest. Then Paprika is 2, and Pictures are 1 each. Since there are 3 Pictures, maybe splitting them could be beneficial. But since each Picture is only worth 1, maybe it&#x27;s better to take as many as possible if possible.<br/><br/>But I need to make a secret proposal. The other player will also make one. For the proposals to be complementary, the total items requested by both must not exceed the available quantities. So, for example, if I ask for the Orange and the Paprika, the other player can&#x27;t ask for those. But if I take the Orange, the other player can&#x27;t take it. Similarly for the Paprika.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 1 Orange, 1 Paprika, 3 Pictures. So each item is unique except for the Pictures. So if I take the Orange, the other player can&#x27;t. Same with Paprika. The Pictures can be split, but since there are 3, maybe each can take some. But since each Picture is worth 1, maybe taking all three would be better, but if the other player also wants some, that could be a problem.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to think about what I can propose that would maximize my score, considering that the other player might have different values. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an assumption. Maybe they value the Orange less, or maybe they value the Paprika more. But without knowing, I have to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but maybe not as high to the other player. For example, if I take the Orange, which is worth 5 to me, but maybe the other player values it less. But if they also value it highly, then my proposal would conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose the Orange and the Paprika, which are the two highest value items for me. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, we can both get them. But if they do, then we get nothing.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and some Pictures. Since there are 3 Pictures, maybe taking 2 or 3. But if I take 3, then the other player can&#x27;t take any. But if I take 2, maybe they can take 1. But since each Picture is worth 1, maybe it&#x27;s better to take as many as possible.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal is also secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let me think about possible combinations.<br/><br/>If I propose the Orange and the Paprika, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player would need to propose the 3 Pictures. But if they do that, then our proposals are complementary. But if they propose something else, like the Orange and some Pictures, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the Orange and 2 Pictures, then the other player could propose the Paprika and 1 Picture. That would be complementary. But if they propose the Paprika and 2 Pictures, then we have a conflict on the Pictures.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and 1 Picture. Then the other player could propose the Paprika and 2 Pictures. That would be complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. The key is to maximize my own score while ensuring that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and the Paprika. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes those, then we get nothing. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get both. But if they do, then we get nothing. But maybe that&#x27;s a risk. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and some Pictures, and the Paprika. But that might be too much.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 1 Orange, 1 Paprika, 3 Pictures. So if I take the Orange and Paprika, that&#x27;s 2 items. The other player would need to take the 3 Pictures. But if they take the 3 Pictures, then our proposals are complementary. But if they take something else, like the Orange, then it&#x27;s not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and 3 Pictures. That would take all the Pictures. Then the other player can&#x27;t take any Pictures. But if they propose the Paprika, then we can both get the Orange and the Paprika. Wait, no. If I take the Orange and 3 Pictures, and they take the Paprika, then our proposals are complementary. Because I have Orange and 3 Pictures, they have Paprika. That&#x27;s all items. So that would be a good proposal. But if they also propose the Orange, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to take the highest value items for me. So Orange (5) and Paprika (2). That&#x27;s 7 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then I get 7. If they do, then we get nothing. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Orange and 2 Pictures (total 5+1+1=7), and the other player takes the Paprika and 1 Picture (2+1=3). That would be complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose one. The safest bet might be to take the Orange and the Paprika. Because those are the two highest value items for me. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include those, then I get both. If they do, then we get nothing. But maybe that&#x27;s the best possible.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the Orange and 3 Pictures. That&#x27;s 5+1+1+1=8. But if the other player takes the Paprika, then we can both get their items. But if they also take the Orange, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe taking the Orange and 3 Pictures is better. But if they also want the Orange, then it&#x27;s a problem.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the Orange and 1 Picture. Then the other player could take the Paprika and 2 Pictures. That would be complementary. But again, depends on their proposal.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to decide. Let me think about the possible scenarios.<br/><br/>If I propose the Orange and the Paprika, then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include either. So they would have to take the 3 Pictures. If they do that, then I get 5+2=7, they get 3*1=3. Total 10. That&#x27;s good.<br/><br/>If I propose the Orange and 3 Pictures, then the other player can take the Paprika. That would be complementary. I get 5+3=8, they get 2. Total 10. That&#x27;s better for me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose the Orange and 2 Pictures, then the other player could take the Paprika and 1 Picture. That&#x27;s complementary. I get 5+2=7, they get 2+1=3. Total 10.<br/><br/>But if I propose the Orange and 3 Pictures, that&#x27;s 8 points. If the other player&#x27;s proposal is the Paprika, then it&#x27;s complementary. So that&#x27;s better. But if they also propose the Orange, then it&#x27;s not. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to take the Orange and 3 Pictures. Because that&#x27;s the maximum I can get if they don&#x27;t conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the Orange and the Paprika. But if the other player also wants those, then we get nothing. But if they don&#x27;t, then I get 7. But if I take the Orange and 3 Pictures, I get 8, which is better. So maybe that&#x27;s better.<br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose the Orange and 3 Pictures. That way, if they take the Paprika, it&#x27;s complementary. If they take something else, maybe not. But it&#x27;s a risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and the Paprika. Because if the other player&#x27;s proposal is the 3 Pictures, then we both get our items. But if they propose the Orange, then it&#x27;s a conflict.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to take the highest value items. So Orange (5) and Paprika (2). That&#x27;s 7. If they don&#x27;t take those, I get 7. If they do, then 0. But maybe that&#x27;s the best I can do.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should take the Orange and 1 Picture. Then the other player could take the Paprika and 2 Pictures. That&#x27;s complementary. I get 5+1=6, they get 2+2=4. Total 10. But that&#x27;s less than 8 if I take the Orange and 3 Pictures.<br/><br/>So, considering that, maybe the best is to propose the Orange and 3 Pictures. That gives me 8 points if the other player takes the Paprika. If they take the Orange, then it&#x27;s a conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s the best bet.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the Orange and the Paprika. Let me check the numbers again. If I take both, that&#x27;s 5+2=7. If the other player takes the 3 Pictures, then it&#x27;s complementary. So that&#x27;s 7 for me. If they take the Orange, then conflict. But if they take the Paprika, then conflict. So it&#x27;s a 50-50 chance? Not sure.<br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose. Maybe the best is to take the Orange and 3 Pictures. Because that&#x27;s 8 points, which is higher than 7. So I&#x27;ll go with that.<br/></p>

        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The other player made a secret proposal, and now it&#x27;s my turn to make my own. The goal is to get a high score by having complementary proposals. The items available are 1 Orange, 1 Paprika, and 3 Pictures. My values are Orange:7, Paprika:3, Picture:0. <br/><br/>First, I need to figure out what the other player might have proposed. Since they made a secret proposal, I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. The other player might want items that are valuable to them. Since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an educated guess.<br/><br/>My own values are high for Orange (7) and moderate for Paprika (3), and Pictures are worthless to me. So I should prioritize getting the Orange and Paprika. The other player might have different priorities. If they value Pictures, maybe they want those, but since I don&#x27;t get any value from Pictures, maybe I can offer them to the other player if it helps in getting the Orange or Paprika.<br/><br/>But since the other player already made a proposal, I need to make mine complementary. Let&#x27;s think about possible scenarios. If the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the Orange, then I need to make sure my proposal doesn&#x27;t include it, or vice versa. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while possibly complementing theirs.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items in both proposals don&#x27;t overlap and there are enough items), then both get points. Otherwise, both get zero. So my goal is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other&#x27;s, covers all items without overlap. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can respond to. For example, if they proposed to take the Orange, I might want to take the Paprika. But without knowing their exact proposal, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>But the user is now asking me to make my own secret proposal. So I need to decide what to propose. Since I value Orange the most, I should definitely include that in my proposal. The Paprika is also valuable, so maybe include that too. But if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take them, which might be okay if their proposal doesn&#x27;t include them. However, if their proposal includes either, then my proposal would conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose only the Orange, leaving the Paprika and Pictures for the other player. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the Paprika, then my proposal would be complementary. But again, without knowing their proposal, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Wait, the other player made a secret proposal. So I need to make my own. The key is to make a proposal that, when combined with theirs, covers all items. But since I don&#x27;t know theirs, I have to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be complementary.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can counter. For example, if they proposed to take the Orange, I might propose to take the Paprika. But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s a guess.<br/><br/>But given that I have to make a proposal, I should focus on the items I value most. So I should propose the Orange and maybe the Paprika. However, if I take both, then the other player can&#x27;t take them. But if their proposal includes either, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe the best approach is to propose the Orange and the Paprika, hoping that the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include them. Alternatively, maybe propose only the Orange, leaving the Paprika and Pictures for the other player. But if the other player&#x27;s proposal includes the Paprika, then my proposal would be complementary.

But if their proposal includes either, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something else. For example, maybe they proposed to take the Pictures. Then my proposal of Orange and Paprika would be complementary. Alternatively, if they proposed to take the Orange, then my proposal would conflict.<br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value. So I should propose the Orange and Paprika. That way, if the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include them, I get both. If their proposal includes one, then it&#x27;s not complementary, but maybe I can still get some points if their proposal is different. Wait, no. If the proposals are not complementary, both get zero. So I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs are complementary.<br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe the other player&#x27;s proposal is something that I can complement. For example, if they proposed to take the Pictures, then I can take the Orange and Paprika.

If their proposal includes one, then it&#x27;s not complementary, but maybe I can still get some points if their proposal is different. Wait, no.
