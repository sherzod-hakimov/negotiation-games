Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n2 Haken, 2 Teller, 1 Schüssel\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nHaken: 3, Teller: 1, Schüssel: 2\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 2 hooks, 2 plates, and 1 bowl. My secret valuation is hooks:3, plates:1, bowl:2. The other player has their own secret valuations, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are 2 hooks, 2 plates, and 1 bowl, the total items are 5. Each player can get some combination. But since the other player's valuations are unknown, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nThe key is that both proposals must be complementary. So if I propose something, the other player's proposal must not overlap in items. For example, if I take both hooks, the other player can't take any hooks. Similarly for plates and bowl.\n\nMy valuation: hooks are the most valuable (3 each), then bowl (2), then plates (1). So I should prioritize getting hooks and bowl. But since there are two hooks, maybe splitting them could be good if the other player also values them. But if I take both, the other player can't get any. Alternatively, maybe taking one hook and the bowl, leaving one hook and two plates for the other. But I need to think about possible complementary proposals.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n1. I take both hooks and the bowl. Then the other player would need to take the two plates. But if their valuation for plates is low, they might not accept. But since I don't know their valuations, this is risky. However, if I can get both hooks and bowl, that's 3+3+2=8 for me. The other player would get 1+1=2. Total 10. But if their valuations for plates are higher, maybe they would prefer that. But since I don't know, maybe this is a good proposal.\n\n2. Alternatively, take one hook and the bowl. Then the other player could take the remaining hook and two plates. My score would be 3+2=5, and theirs could be 3+1+1=5. Total 10. But if they value the hook more, maybe they would take both hooks. But again, without knowing their valuations, it's hard.\n\n3. Another option: take both hooks and one plate. Then the other player would need to take the remaining plate and the bowl. My score: 3+3+1=7. Their score: 1+2=3. Total 10. But again, depends on their valuations.\n\nBut since the other player's valuations are secret, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe the best approach is to propose taking the most valuable items for me, which are hooks and bowl. So [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 bowl]. Then the other player would need to take the two plates. If their valuation for plates is at least 1 each, they would get 2 points. But if they value plates more, maybe they would prefer that. However, since I don't know, this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking one hook and the bowl. Then the other player could take the other hook and two plates. If they value the hook more, they might take it. But again, without knowing, it's uncertain.\n\nAnother thought: since the bowl is only one, if I take it, the other player can't. So maybe taking the bowl is important. But if I don't take it, maybe the other player will. So perhaps I should propose taking the bowl. But then I need to decide on the hooks and plates.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the proposals are complementary, both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player is likely to accept. Since I don't know their valuations, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. But since I don't know, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to propose taking the items that are most valuable to me, assuming that the other player's valuations are similar. But that's an assumption. However, given the information, I have to make a proposal.\n\nSo, considering my valuations, the best items are hooks and bowl. So I should propose taking both hooks and the bowl. That would be [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 bowl]. Then the other player would have to take the two plates. If their valuation for plates is at least 1 each, they would accept. If not, they might not. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking one hook and the bowl. That way, the other player can take the other hook and two plates. If they value the hook more, they might take it. But again, without knowing, it's a risk.\n\nAnother angle: the total value of all items for me is 2*3 + 2*1 + 2 = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10. If I can get all items, that's 10. But the other player would get nothing. But if the other player's valuations are such that they can't accept my proposal, then both get zero. So it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the items. For example, take one hook, one plate, and the bowl. Then the other player takes one hook and one plate. My score: 3 +1 +2 =6. Their score: 3 +1=4. Total 10. But again, depends on their valuations.\n\nBut since I don't know their valuations, maybe the safest bet is to propose the items I value most. So [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 bowl]. Let me check if that's possible. The other player would need to take the two plates. If they accept, then both get their scores. If not, both get zero. But since I can't know, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking one hook and the bowl. Then the other player can take the other hook and two plates. If they value the hook more, they might take it. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nI think the best approach is to propose the items I value most, which are the hooks and the bowl. So I'll make that proposal.\n",
