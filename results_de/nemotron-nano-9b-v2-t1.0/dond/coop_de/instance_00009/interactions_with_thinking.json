                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, and 4 cards. My secret value function is bolts:6, picture:4, egg:0, cards:0. So I really want the bolt and picture, and the egg and cards don't matter to me. \n\nThe other player's value function isn't given, but since we need to maximize the total sum, I should consider what they might value. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should assume they have different priorities. But since the problem is cooperative, we need to find a split where both get items they value. \n\nThe rules say that if the proposals are complementary (enough items for both), then each gets their items' values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make sure that the items we propose don't overlap. \n\nSince I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and hope the other player does the same. But since I don't know their values, I need to think about possible scenarios.\n\nWait, but the other player's value function is secret. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Since I value bolts and pictures, maybe I should propose to take those. But if the other player also wants those, then the proposals would conflict. However, if I can get the bolt and picture, and the other player gets the egg and cards, which I don't care about, that would be good. But I don't know if the other player values the egg or cards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the egg or cards. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes the chance of a complementary split. \n\nAnother thought: since the total items are 1 bolt, 1 picture, 1 egg, 4 cards. If I take the bolt and picture, that's two items. The other player would need to take the egg and cards. But if the other player's value function is such that they don't value the egg or cards, then their proposal might not include those. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose to take the bolt and picture, and suggest that the other player take the egg and cards. \n\nBut how to communicate that? Since messages are sent to the other player, but the secret proposal is the only way to make a formal offer. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the bolt and picture. Then, if the other player's proposal is complementary, we both get points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to suggest that they take the egg and cards. But since messages are public, the other player might not trust me. However, the secret proposal is the only way to make a formal offer. \n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, then both get their items. So the key is to make a secret proposal that is complementary to the other player's. But since I don't know their proposal, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nGiven that I value bolts and pictures, I should propose to take those. Then, the other player's proposal should take the remaining items (egg and cards). If the other player's proposal is to take egg and cards, then it's complementary. But if they propose something else, like taking the bolt, then it's not. \n\nBut since I can't know their proposal, maybe the best strategy is to make a secret proposal that includes the items I value, and hope the other player does the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to suggest that they take the egg and cards. But since messages are public, the other player might not follow through. However, the secret proposal is the only way to make a formal offer. \n\nSo the optimal move here is to make a secret proposal that includes the bolt and picture. That way, if the other player's proposal is to take the egg and cards, we both get our items. If not, we both get zero. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, maybe they also value the bolt and picture. In that case, our proposals would conflict, leading to zero. But if they value the egg or cards, then it's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player's value function is such that they value the egg or cards. For example, if they value the egg, then taking the egg would be good for them. But since I don't know, I have to make an assumption. \n\nBut given that my value function is known, and the other player's is secret, the best I can do is to propose the items I value. So I should make a secret proposal with [Proposal: 1 Bolt, 1 Picture]. \n\nThen, if the other player's proposal is to take the egg and cards, we both get our items. If they propose something else, like taking the bolt, then it's not complementary. \n\nBut since the other player's proposal is also secret, I can't know. However, the goal is to maximize the sum. So if I can get the bolt and picture, and the other player gets the egg and cards, that's the best case. \n\nTherefore, I should make a secret proposal for the bolt and picture. That's the best I can do given the information.\n"
