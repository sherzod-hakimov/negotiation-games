        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s start by understanding the problem. We need to divide the items between me and the other player. The items available are 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 card, 1 eraser, and 1 sponge. My secret values are: hooks are worth 3 each, flower 3, card 0, eraser 1, sponge 0. The other player&#x27;s values are unknown, but we need to maximize the total sum of both our scores. <br/><br/>First, I should figure out what items are valuable to me. Hooks and flowers are both worth 3 each. The eraser is worth 1, and the others are 0. So I want to get as many hooks and flowers as possible. But since there are only 2 hooks and 1 flower, I need to decide how to split them. <br/><br/>The other player&#x27;s preferences are unknown, but since we want to maximize the total, we need to consider that they might value different items. However, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. But maybe we can make a proposal that covers the most valuable items for both. <br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we each want don&#x27;t overlap), then we both get points. Otherwise, we get zero. So the key is to make sure that our proposals don&#x27;t have overlapping items. <br/><br/>Since I have two hooks, maybe I can take both hooks and the flower. But if the other player also wants hooks or the flower, that would conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can take the hooks and the eraser, which is worth 1. But the flower is more valuable. <br/><br/>Wait, the flower is worth 3 to me. If I take the flower, that&#x27;s a big gain. But if the other player also wants the flower, then we can&#x27;t both have it. So maybe I should propose taking the flower and the hooks. But then the other player might not want those. Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, leaving the hooks for the other player. But if the other player values hooks, that could be good. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. Let&#x27;s think about possible splits. <br/><br/>If I take both hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s 3+3=6 points for me. The other player would get the card, eraser, and sponge. If their values for those are low, maybe they get 1 (eraser) or 0. But if they value the eraser, that&#x27;s 1. So total would be 6 + 1 = 7. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser, that&#x27;s 3+1=4. The other player gets the two hooks, which if they value hooks, that&#x27;s 3 each, so 6. Total 4+6=10. That&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>But how do I know if the other player values hooks? Since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, leaving the hooks for them. That way, if they value hooks, they get a good deal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the eraser. That&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. The other player gets the flower, which is 3 if they value it. Total 7+3=10. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. However, since the goal is to maximize the total, maybe the best approach is to split the items in a way that covers the most valuable items for both. <br/><br/>Another angle: the total value of all items for me is 3+3+0+1+0=7. If I can get all items, that&#x27;s 7, but the other player would get nothing. But if we can&#x27;t agree, we both get zero. So maybe it&#x27;s better to split. <br/><br/>But how to propose? Let&#x27;s think about possible proposals. <br/><br/>My proposal could be: [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower, 1 eraser]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. The other player would need to propose items that don&#x27;t overlap. If they propose, say, the card and sponge, which are 0 for me, but maybe they value them. But if they don&#x27;t, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower], then the other player might propose [Proposal: 1 eraser, 1 card, 1 sponge]. If their values for eraser are 1, then total would be 7 + 1 = 8. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s values for the eraser are higher, say 5, then they would get 5, making total 7+5=12. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make an educated guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, leaving the hooks for the other player. If they value hooks, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. The first message could be a proposal. Let me check the rules again. <br/><br/>The rules say that each can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. So maybe the first step is to make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>So my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me decide what to propose. <br/><br/>If I propose taking the two hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s 3+3=6. The other player would need to propose items that don&#x27;t include hooks or flower. They could take the eraser, card, sponge. If they value the eraser, that&#x27;s 1. Total 6+1=7. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose taking the flower and the eraser, that&#x27;s 3+1=4. The other player could take the two hooks, which if they value them, that&#x27;s 3 each, total 6. So 4+6=10. <br/><br/>Which is better? 10 is better than 7. So maybe that&#x27;s a better proposal. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value hooks, then they might not take them. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to assume that they might. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the eraser. That&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. The other player could take the flower, which is 3. Total 7+3=10. <br/><br/>Same as before. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser, and the other player takes the hooks. <br/><br/>But how to decide? Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose items that are valuable to me and leave the rest for them. <br/><br/>But the problem is that if the other player&#x27;s proposal overlaps, we both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Another thought: the total value of all items for me is 7. If I can get all items, that&#x27;s 7, but the other player gets nothing. But if we can&#x27;t agree, we get zero. So maybe it&#x27;s better to split. <br/><br/>But how to split? Let&#x27;s think of possible splits. <br/><br/>Option 1: I take 2 hooks, 1 flower. Other takes 1 eraser, 1 card, 1 sponge. <br/><br/>Option 2: I take 1 hook, 1 flower, 1 eraser. Other takes 1 hook, 1 card, 1 sponge. <br/><br/>Option 3: I take 2 hooks, 1 eraser. Other takes 1 flower, 1 card, 1 sponge. <br/><br/>Option 4: I take 1 hook, 1 flower, 1 eraser. Other takes 1 hook, 1 card, 1 sponge. <br/><br/>In each case, the total depends on the other player&#x27;s values. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes the expected total. <br/><br/>Assuming that the other player might value the eraser (since it&#x27;s worth 1 to me), maybe they also value it. If I take the eraser, they can&#x27;t. But if I leave it, they might take it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser, that&#x27;s 4. The other player could take the two hooks (6) if they value them. <br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t value hooks, then they might take the card or sponge, which are 0 for me. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose taking the flower and the eraser, leaving the hooks for the other player. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and hope the other player takes the eraser. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a bit of a guess. <br/><br/>Another approach: since the total value of all items for me is 7, and the other player&#x27;s total could be up to whatever their values are. But since I want to maximize the sum, I need to ensure that both of us get as much as possible. <br/><br/>If I take the flower (3) and the eraser (1), that&#x27;s 4. The other player could take the two hooks (3 each, total 6). So total 10. <br/><br/>If I take the two hooks (6) and the eraser (1), that&#x27;s 7. The other player could take the flower (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value the hooks or the flower, then their total would be lower. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose either of these. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, and the other player can take the hooks. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Which is better? <br/><br/>If I take 2 hooks and 1 eraser (7), and the other takes the flower (3), total 10. <br/><br/>If I take 1 flower and 1 eraser (4), and the other takes 2 hooks (6), total 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s values for the flower are higher. If they value the flower more than 3, then taking the flower would be better. But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a 50-50. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>So either proposal could work. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s values for the eraser are higher. If they value the eraser more than 1, then leaving it for them would be better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a choice. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, and the other player can take the hooks. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>That way, if the other player values the hooks, they get 6, and I get 4. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t value the hooks, they might take the card or sponge, which are 0. <br/><br/>But since I want to maximize the total, I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. <br/><br/>So the key is to make a proposal that doesn&#x27;t overlap with what the other player might propose. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their proposal, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Another thought: the other player might also have similar values. If they also value hooks and flowers, then we need to split them. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose taking the flower and the eraser, and the other player can take the hooks. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should start with a proposal. <br/><br/>So my first message would be a secret proposal. Let me choose [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Which is better? <br/><br/>If I take the flower and eraser, the other player can take the two hooks. If they value hooks, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>If I take the two hooks and eraser, the other player can take the flower. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the flower is higher. For example, if they value the flower at 5, then taking the flower would give them 5, and I get 4 (flower + eraser). Total 9. <br/><br/>But if I take the two hooks and eraser, and they take the flower (5), total is 7 +5=12. <br/><br/>So in that case, taking the two hooks and eraser would be better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value the eraser, they might not take it. <br/><br/>But since the eraser is worth 1 to me, maybe they also value it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, and the other player can take the two hooks. <br/><br/>In that case, if the other player values hooks, they get 6, and I get 4. Total 10. <br/><br/>If they don&#x27;t value hooks, they might take the card or sponge, which are 0. <br/><br/>But since I want to maximize the total, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>Hmm. <br/><br/>Another angle: the total value of all items for me is 7. If I can get all items, that&#x27;s 7, but the other player gets nothing. But if we can&#x27;t agree, we get zero. So maybe it&#x27;s better to split. <br/><br/>But how to split? <br/><br/>If I take the two hooks (6) and the eraser (1), total 7. The other player takes the flower (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>If I take the flower (3) and the eraser (1), total 4. The other player takes the two hooks (6). Total 10. <br/><br/>Same result. <br/><br/>So either proposal is equally good. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the flower is higher. If they value the flower more than 3, then taking the flower would be better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a choice. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t want the eraser, they might not take it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the eraser, and the other player can take the flower. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>So perhaps either proposal is acceptable. <br/><br/>But since the flower is worth 3 to me, and the hooks are also 3 each, maybe taking both hooks and the flower is better for me. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the flower, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>So maybe the best is to propose taking the two hooks and the eraser, leaving the flower for the other player. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the flower, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser, leaving the hooks for the other player. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>I think I need to make a decision here. <br/><br/>Since the flower is worth 3 to me, and the hooks are also 3 each, maybe taking both hooks and the flower would give me 6+3=9, but that&#x27;s not possible because there are only 2 hooks and 1 flower. Wait, no, the items are 2 hooks, 1 flower, etc. So if I take both hooks and the flower, that&#x27;s 2 hooks (3 each) and 1 flower (3), total 3*2 +3=9. But the other player would get the eraser, card, sponge. If they value the eraser, that&#x27;s 1. Total 9+1=10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the flower and the eraser (3+1=4), and the other player takes the two hooks (3+3=6), total 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>So either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value the hooks or the flower, then their total would be lower. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose either. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages, maybe I should start with a proposal. <br/><br/>So my first message would be a secret proposal. Let me choose [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Which is better? <br/><br/>If I take 2 hooks and 1 eraser, that&#x27;s 3*2 +1=7. The other player can take the flower (3) and the card and sponge (0). So total 7+3=10. <br/><br/>If I take 1 flower and 1 eraser, that&#x27;s 4. The other player can take 2 hooks (6). Total 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s value for the flower is higher. If they value the flower at 5, then taking the flower would give them 5, and I get 4. Total 9. <br/><br/>But if I take the two hooks and eraser, and they take the flower (5), total is 7+5=12. <br/><br/>So in that case, taking the two hooks and eraser is better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t want the eraser, they might not take it. <br/><br/>But since the eraser is worth 1 to me, maybe they also value it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>I think I need to make a choice. <br/><br/>Since the flower is worth 3 to me, and the hooks are also 3 each, maybe taking both hooks and the flower is better for me. <br/><br/>But if the other player also values the flower, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>But if I propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player proposes taking the eraser, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower]. <br/><br/>Then the other player&#x27;s proposal would need to be items not in my proposal. <br/><br/>If they propose [Proposal: 1 eraser], then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>So total would be 7 (me) + 1 (them) = 8. <br/><br/>But if they propose something else, like the card or sponge, which are 0 for me, but maybe they value them. <br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t, then we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser], then the other player can take the flower. <br/><br/>If they value the flower, that&#x27;s 3. Total 7+3=10. <br/><br/>So that&#x27;s better. <br/><br/>So maybe proposing [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser] is better because it leaves the flower for the other player, which could be valuable. <br/><br/>But if the other player doesn&#x27;t value the flower, then they might not take it. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the flower and the eraser, and the other player can take the two hooks. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>I think the key is that either proposal could lead to a total of 10, which is better than 7 if I take everything. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll go with proposing [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. <br/><br/>Another thought: the other player might have a secret value function. If they value the flower highly, then taking it would be good. If they value the hooks, then taking them is good. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose items that are valuable to me and leave the rest. <br/><br/>So [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 flower] would give me 6+3=9. The other player can take the eraser (1). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [Proposal: 1 flower, 1 eraser] gives me 4, and the other player can take 2 hooks (6). Total 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value for the flower is higher than 3, then taking the flower would be better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s better to take the two hooks and the eraser. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose taking the two hooks and the flower, and the other player can take the eraser. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. <br/><br/>I think I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser]. <br/><br/>So my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 2 hooks, 1 eraser].<br/></p>
