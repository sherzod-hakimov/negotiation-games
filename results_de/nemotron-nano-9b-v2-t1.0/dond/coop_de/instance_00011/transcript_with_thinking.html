        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 1 Ring, 3 Fruits, and 1 Coin. My secret value function is Ring:6, Fruit:1, Coin:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>First, I should consider possible strategies. Since we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to decide when to propose. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don&#x27;t overlap in items), we both get points based on our own valuations. Otherwise, we get zero. So the challenge is to find a proposal that the other player is likely to accept, given their unknown valuations.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they value the Ring highly, or maybe they prefer Fruits or Coins. But since I can&#x27;t know, I need to propose something that&#x27;s likely to be complementary. <br/><br/>Let me think about possible proposals. If I propose to take the Ring and some Fruits, maybe the other player would take the Coin and the remaining Fruits. But if they value the Ring more, they might not accept. Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and some Fruits, maybe they take the Ring. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Another approach is to propose a split that maximizes the minimum possible gain. For example, if I take the Ring and one Fruit, and the other takes the remaining two Fruits and the Coin. But if the other player values the Coin highly, they might not accept. Alternatively, if I take the Coin and all Fruits, but that might leave the Ring for them. But if they value the Ring more, they might accept. <br/><br/>Wait, but the problem is that if our proposals are not complementary, we both get zero. So I need to make sure that whatever I propose, the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t conflict. But since I don&#x27;t know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible, so that the other player can respond with a complementary one. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. If I make a secret proposal, the other player might respond with their own. But if I don&#x27;t make a secret proposal, I can send messages to negotiate. However, the rules say that messages are sent directly, so I need to communicate without using the secret proposal format. <br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to decide whether to send a message or make a secret proposal. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe making a secret proposal is better if I can get a good deal. But without knowing the other player&#x27;s values, it&#x27;s risky. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to propose a split. For example, &quot;I propose to take the Ring and 2 Fruits. You can take the Coin and 1 Fruit.&quot; But I need to make sure that this is a valid proposal. However, since I don&#x27;t know their values, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s secret values are unknown. So maybe I should propose something that is likely to be acceptable. For example, if I take the Ring and 1 Fruit, and the other takes the Coin and 2 Fruits. That way, there&#x27;s no overlap. But if the other player values the Coin more, they might prefer that. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Coin and all 3 Fruits, and the other takes the Ring. That would be complementary. But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose a split that gives me the highest possible value, assuming the other player is rational. For example, if I take the Ring (which is worth 6 to me) and the Coin (1), and the other takes the 3 Fruits (which are worth 1 each, so 3 total). But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Ring and 3 Fruits, but that would leave nothing for the other player. That&#x27;s not good. <br/><br/>Wait, the items are 1 Ring, 3 Fruits, 1 Coin. So total items are 5. If I take the Ring and 3 Fruits, that&#x27;s 4 items, leaving the Coin. The other player could take the Coin. But if they value the Coin highly, they might accept. <br/><br/>But if I propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits, and the other player proposes to take the Coin, then it&#x27;s complementary. So that would be a good split. But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is compatible. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I make a secret proposal, maybe I can get a better deal. For example, if I propose [Proposal: 1 Ring, 3 Fruits], then the other player might respond with their own proposal. But if they don&#x27;t, then maybe I can proceed. <br/><br/>But the problem is that I don&#x27;t know their values. So maybe the best strategy is to propose a split that maximizes my own value, assuming the other player is also trying to maximize their own. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and the Coin, and the other player takes the 3 Fruits. That way, I get 6+1=7, and they get 3. Total sum is 10. But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Coin and 3 Fruits (value 1+3=4), and the other takes the Ring (6). Total sum 10. That&#x27;s the same. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the Coin more, say, if their value for Coin is higher than 1, then they might prefer to take the Coin. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make an assumption. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit, and the other takes 2 Fruits and the Coin. That way, I get 6+1=7, they get 2+1=3. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 Ring, 1 Fruit]. Then the other player might respond with their own proposal. If they propose something that doesn&#x27;t conflict, then we both get points. <br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know my values. So maybe it&#x27;s better to communicate. <br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to decide my first move. <br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Maybe the best first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player can respond with their own. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. <br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, I need to choose which items to take. Let&#x27;s say I propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits. That&#x27;s 4 items. The other player would need to take the Coin. If they accept, then I get 6+3=9, they get 1. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Coin and 3 Fruits, that&#x27;s 4 items. The other takes the Ring. I get 1+3=4, they get 6. Total 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept my proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose to take the Ring and 2 Fruits, and the other takes 1 Fruit and the Coin. That&#x27;s 3 items each. I get 6+2=8, they get 1+1=2. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and the Coin, and the other takes the 3 Fruits. That&#x27;s 2 items for me, 3 for them. I get 6+1=7, they get 3. Total 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the 3 Fruits and the Coin, and the other takes the Ring. That&#x27;s 4 items for me, 1 for them. I get 3+1=4, they get 6. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>So regardless of how I split, the maximum possible total is 10 (6+3+1=10). But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they can get more. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to propose a split. For example, &quot;I propose to take the Ring and 2 Fruits. You can take the Coin and 1 Fruit.&quot; <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that this is a valid proposal. If the other player agrees, then we both get points. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their response, maybe I should make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask them what they value. But the rules say that messages are sent directly, so I can&#x27;t ask questions. <br/><br/>Wait, the rules say that messages are sent directly, so I can&#x27;t ask questions. I have to propose something. <br/><br/>So, given that, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, the other player can respond with their own. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. <br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, I need to choose which items to take. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Proposal: 1 Ring, 3 Fruits]. Then the other player might respond with [Proposal: 1 Coin]. That would be complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 Coin, 3 Fruits], the other might take the Ring. <br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know my values. So maybe it&#x27;s better to communicate. <br/><br/>But since I can send messages, maybe I should send a message to the other player to propose a split. <br/><br/>For example, &quot;I propose to take the Ring and 2 Fruits. You can take the Coin and 1 Fruit.&quot; <br/><br/>If the other player accepts, then we both get points. <br/><br/>But if they don&#x27;t, then we might have to make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal first. <br/><br/>But the problem is that I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. So maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value, assuming the other player is rational. <br/><br/>For example, if I take the Ring (6) and the Coin (1), total 7. The other player takes 3 Fruits (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Ring and 3 Fruits (9), the other takes the Coin (1). Total 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Coin and 3 Fruits (4), the other takes the Ring (6). Total 10. <br/><br/>So in all cases, the total is 10. But if the other player&#x27;s values are different, maybe they can get more. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 1 Fruit, and the other takes 2 Fruits and the Coin. That way, I get 6+1=7, they get 2+1=3. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>So maybe the best is to make a secret proposal. Let me choose to propose [Proposal: 1 Ring, 3 Fruits]. <br/><br/>But I need to make sure that the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary. If they propose to take the Coin, then it&#x27;s okay. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know my values. So maybe it&#x27;s better to send a message. <br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to decide my first action. <br/><br/>Since I can send messages or make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>If I send a message, I can propose a split. For example, &quot;I propose to take the Ring and 2 Fruits. You can take the Coin and 1 Fruit.&quot; <br/><br/>But I need to format it correctly. The message should not be in secret proposal format. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I can make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>But which is better? <br/><br/>If I make a secret proposal, the other player might respond with their own. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. <br/><br/>But if I make a secret proposal, I have to choose which items to take. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to propose a split. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose a split that gives me the highest possible value, assuming the other player is rational. <br/><br/>For example, if I take the Ring (6) and the Coin (1), and the other takes 3 Fruits (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the Ring and 3 Fruits (9), the other takes the Coin (1). Total 10. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if the other player values the Coin more, they might not accept. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe I should propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll make a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Ring, 3 Fruits]. <br/><br/>Then the other player might respond with their own proposal. If they propose to take the Coin, then it&#x27;s complementary. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they propose something else, maybe we have to negotiate. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to decide. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message first. <br/><br/>But the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to make my first move. <br/><br/>I think making a secret proposal is a good first step. Let me go with that. <br/><br/>So my first action is to make a secret proposal. <br/><br/>I&#x27;ll propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits. <br/><br/>So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Ring, 3 Fruits]. <br/><br/>Then the other player can respond. If they accept, we both get points. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t, maybe I can send messages. <br/><br/>But since I can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to be careful. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to propose a split. <br/><br/>But the problem is that without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to know what they would accept. <br/><br/>But given that my value for the Ring is 6, which is higher than the others, maybe I should prioritize getting the Ring. <br/><br/>So I&#x27;ll propose to take the Ring and 3 Fruits. <br/><br/>If the other player takes the Coin, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>If they don&#x27;t, maybe they propose something else. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll proceed with the secret proposal.<br/></p>
