Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Topf, 3 Magnete, 1 Teller\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nTopf: 5, Magnet: 0, Teller: 5\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 pot, 3 magnets, and 1 plate. My secret value function is pot:5, magnet:0, plate:5. So I really value pots and plates, but magnets don't matter to me. \n\nFirst, I should consider what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I have to make assumptions. But maybe I can infer based on possible strategies. Since magnets are worthless to me, maybe the other player values them? Or maybe they also value pots and plates. \n\nThe key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., the items we each want don't overlap), then we both get points. Otherwise, we get zero. So the challenge is to propose items in a way that covers all items without overlap. \n\nSince there are 1 pot, 3 magnets, and 1 plate, the total items are 5. Each player can propose some items. If I propose, say, the pot and the plate, and the other player proposes the magnets, that would be complementary. But if both propose the pot, then it's a conflict. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. Since magnets are worthless to me, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and leave the magnets for the other player. But if the other player also values the pot or plate, that could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. That would be complementary. But if the other player also wants the pot or plate, then it's a conflict. \n\nWait, but the other player's value function is secret. So I have to make a proposal that's safe. Since I value pot and plate, I should try to get those. But if the other player also values them, then we might have a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. If that's the case, then we both get our items. But if the other player also wants the pot or plate, then it's a problem. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best approach is to propose the pot and plate, and hope the other player proposes the magnets. Alternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the same, leading to a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. That would be ideal. But how to ensure that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the same. Then we both get zero. That's bad. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. That would be good. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. Let me think about the possible combinations. \n\nThe items are 1 pot, 3 magnets, 1 plate. So the total is 5 items. If I propose the pot and plate, that's 2 items. The other player could propose the 3 magnets. That would be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the pot and plate, and the other player proposes the pot and plate, then it's a conflict. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the same. \n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to find a proposal that is likely to be complementary. \n\nAnother angle: since magnets are worthless to me, maybe the other player values them. So if I propose the pot and plate, and the other player proposes the magnets, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, if the other player also values the pot or plate, then we might have a conflict. \n\nBut without knowing, maybe the safest bet is to propose the pot and plate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the same. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. \n\nBut how to communicate that? Since I can only send 5 messages. \n\nWait, the rules say that each player can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. \n\nThe secret proposal format is [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So I need to decide what to propose. \n\nIf I propose the pot and plate, that's [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]. Then the other player might propose the magnets. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the pot and plate, and the other player proposes the same, then it's a conflict. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe I should make a proposal that is as specific as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. \n\nSo my first message would be a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]. \n\nThen, depending on the other player's response, I can adjust. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should first send a message to the other player, but the rules say that non-secret messages are sent directly. But the user hasn't provided the other player's messages yet. \n\nWait, the user is simulating the game. So I need to act as one player, and the other player is another entity. \n\nBut in this case, the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to make my first move. \n\nGiven that, I should make a secret proposal. Since I value pot and plate, I should propose those. \n\nSo my first message would be [Proposal: 1 pot, 1 plate]. \n\nThen, the other player would respond. If they propose the magnets, then we both get points. If they propose something else, maybe we have to adjust. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be careful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and if the other player doesn't propose the magnets, I can adjust. \n\nBut without knowing the other player's values, it's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the same. But that would result in zero points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the pot and plate, and the other player might propose the magnets. \n\nSo I think the best first step is to make a secret proposal for the pot and plate. That way, if the other player is willing to take the magnets, we both get our valuable items. \n\nSo I'll go with that.\n",
