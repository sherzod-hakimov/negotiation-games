            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 hat, 1 soap, and 4 postcards. My secret value function is hat:3, soap:7, postcard:0. So I really want the soap, and the hat is okay, but postcards don't matter to me.\n\nThe other player's value function is unknown, but I need to consider possible scenarios. Since we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I should start by communicating to understand their preferences. But since messages are public, I need to be strategic.\n\nFirst, maybe I should ask them about their preferences. But how? Since I can't send a message that's not a secret proposal, I need to use the secret proposal format only when making an offer. Otherwise, regular messages are public. Wait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, so I can send regular messages to ask questions. But the user's instruction says that if it's not a secret proposal, the message is sent directly. So I can send regular messages to negotiate.\n\nBut the user's initial message is the setup, and now I need to start the game. The first step is to send a message to the other player. Since I can't make a secret proposal yet, I should send a regular message. Maybe ask them what their values are for the items. But since they might not reveal their values, perhaps I need to make an offer.\n\nAlternatively, since I know my own values, I can try to propose a split that benefits me. For example, I could offer the soap to myself and maybe the hat, but I need to see if the other player would accept. But since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nWait, the secret proposal is made by each player, and if they are complementary, both get points. So maybe I should make a secret proposal first. But the rules say that each player is asked to make a secret proposal. So perhaps the process is that each player can make a secret proposal at any time, but they can also send regular messages.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the first step is to start the game. So I need to send a message. Since I can't make a secret proposal yet, I should send a regular message. Maybe something like, \"What are your values for the items?\" But the user's instruction says that messages are sent directly, so I need to phrase it as a message to the other player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. But the rules say that each player is asked to make a secret proposal. So maybe the first step is to make a secret proposal. But the user's message is the setup, and now I need to respond. The user is probably expecting me to make a secret proposal or send a message.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Beginnen wir.\" which means \"Let's start.\" So I need to take the first action. Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The first action could be a secret proposal or a regular message.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, making a secret proposal might be risky. For example, if I propose to take the soap and hat, but the other player values the soap more, they might not accept. Alternatively, if I propose to take the soap, and the other player proposes to take the hat and postcards, maybe that's complementary.\n\nBut since I can't know their values, maybe I should first send a regular message to ask about their preferences. However, the user's instruction says that messages are sent directly, so I need to phrase it as a message. For example, \"Can you tell me your values for the items?\" But I need to make sure that this is a regular message, not a secret proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal. Let me think. If I make a secret proposal, I can propose items that I value. For example, I could propose [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 soap]. Since I value the soap highly (7) and the hat (3), this would give me 10 points. If the other player's proposal is complementary, they would get their items. But if their proposal is not complementary, both get zero.\n\nBut if I make a secret proposal, the other player might not know my values. However, if I can get them to accept, that's good. Alternatively, if I send a regular message, I can try to negotiate.\n\nBut the problem is that the other player's values are secret. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal that maximizes my own value, and hope that the other player's proposal is complementary. For example, if I propose the soap and hat, and the other player proposes the postcards, then it's complementary. But if they propose something else, it might not be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the soap, since that's my highest value item. Then, if the other player proposes the hat and postcards, that would be complementary. But if they propose the soap, then it's not complementary.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, it's a bit of a gamble. However, given that my value for postcards is zero, I don't care about them. So maybe I should focus on getting the soap and hat.\n\nSo, perhaps the best first move is to make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 soap]. That way, if the other player's proposal is the postcards, we both get points. If they propose something else, maybe we can negotiate.\n\nAlternatively, if I send a regular message asking about their values, but since I can't do that in the secret proposal format, I need to send a regular message. But the user's instruction says that messages are sent directly, so I can send a message like \"What are your values for the items?\" But I need to make sure that this is a regular message, not a secret proposal.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that if it's not a secret proposal, the message is sent directly. So I can send a regular message. However, the user might be expecting me to make a secret proposal first. But the rules say that each player is asked to make a secret proposal. So maybe the first step is to make a secret proposal.\n\nBut the user's message is the setup, and now I need to respond. The user is probably expecting me to make a secret proposal or send a message. Since the user hasn't provided the other player's response yet, I need to take the first action.\n\nGiven that, I think the best approach is to make a secret proposal. Since I value the soap highly, I should propose to take the soap. Maybe also the hat, but if the other player also wants the hat, that could be a problem. Alternatively, propose only the soap. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So I need to format it correctly. For example, [Proposal: 1 soap]. Or [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 soap].\n\nIf I propose 1 soap, then the other player's proposal needs to not include the soap. If they propose 1 hat and 4 postcards, then it's complementary. But if they propose 1 soap, then it's not.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose 1 hat and 1 soap, and the other player proposes 4 postcards, that's complementary. But if they propose 1 hat, then it's not.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, it's a risk. However, given that my value for postcards is zero, I can afford to give them away. So maybe proposing the soap and hat is better, as I get 10 points, and if the other player's proposal is the postcards, they get 0 (since their value for postcards is unknown, but maybe they value them). Wait, but the other player's value function is secret. So I can't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose only the soap. That way, if the other player's proposal is the hat and postcards, it's complementary. If they propose the soap, then it's not. But if I propose the soap, and they propose the hat and postcards, then I get 7, they get their value for hat and postcards. But since I don't know their values, it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the hat and soap, and hope that the other player's proposal is the postcards. But again, without knowing their values, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a regular message to ask them about their preferences. For example, \"Can you tell me your values for the items?\" But since I can't make a secret proposal in that message, it's a regular message. However, the user's instruction says that messages are sent directly, so I can do that.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the first step is to start the game. So I need to take an action. Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The first action could be a secret proposal or a regular message.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me go with that. I'll propose the soap and hat, since those are the items I value. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 hat, 1 soap]. That way, if the other player's proposal is the postcards, we both get points. If they propose something else, maybe we can negotiate.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose only the soap, that might be better. Because if the other player's proposal includes the soap, it's not complementary. But if they propose the hat and postcards, then it's complementary. But again, without knowing their values, it's a risk.\n\nBut since I value the soap more, I should prioritize getting it. So I'll make a secret proposal for the soap. Let me check the format again. The secret proposal is [Proposal: <number> <item name>, ...]. So for the soap, it would be [Proposal: 1 soap]. That's a valid format.\n\nSo I think the best first step is to make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 soap]. That way, if the other player's proposal is the hat and postcards, we both get points. If they propose the soap, then it's not complementary. But since I don't know their values, this is a calculated risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose both the hat and soap. But if the other player also wants the hat, that could be a problem. However, since I don't know, it's a gamble. But given that the soap is more valuable to me, I should focus on that.\n\nSo I'll go with the secret proposal for the soap. That's my first action.\n",
