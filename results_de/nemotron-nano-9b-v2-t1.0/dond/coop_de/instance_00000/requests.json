Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n3 Ringe, 1 Würfel, 1 Pfanne\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nRing: 0, Würfel: 4, Pfanne: 6\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 3 rings, 1 die, and 1 pan. My secret value function is Ring: 0, Die: 4, Pan: 6. So, I value the pan the most, then the die, and rings are worthless to me.\n\nThe other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. Since it's a cooperative game, we need to find a way to split the items so that both of us get as much value as possible. But since we can only send 5 messages or make a secret proposal, we need to be strategic.\n\nFirst, I should consider what items are valuable to me. The pan is worth 6, die is 4, rings are 0. So, I should aim to get the pan and die. But the other player might also value these items. If they value the pan highly, maybe we can split it, but since there's only one pan, we can't both have it. Similarly for the die. So, maybe we need to prioritize which items to take based on mutual benefit.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the best approach is to propose taking the pan and die, since those are the most valuable to me. If the other player also values those, then we can split them. But if they don't, maybe they would prefer the rings. However, since rings are worthless to me, maybe they can take the rings and I can take the pan and die. But I need to make sure that the other player's proposal complements mine.\n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So, the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other player's proposal, covers all items without overlap.\n\nSo, if I propose taking the pan and die, then the other player's proposal should take the rings. Since there are 3 rings, maybe they can take all of them. That way, my proposal is [Pan, Die], and theirs is [Ring, Ring, Ring]. That would be complementary. Then I get 6+4=10, and they get whatever their value for the rings is. But since I don't know their values, maybe they would accept that. Alternatively, if they value the pan or die more, they might want to take those, but since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own gain while allowing the other to get something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the pan and die, and the other player might propose taking the rings. That would be a good split. But if the other player's proposal is different, like taking the pan and rings, then my proposal would conflict. So, I need to make sure my proposal is such that the other player can complement it.\n\nAnother thought: since I value the pan and die highly, I should propose taking those. If the other player's proposal is to take the rings, then we can both get our items. If they propose something else, maybe we can adjust. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So, I can propose taking the pan and die. Let me check the items: 3 rings, 1 die, 1 pan. So, if I take pan and die, that's two items. The other player would need to take the 3 rings. That would be complementary. So, my proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. Then, if the other player's proposal is [Proposal: 3 Rings], then we both get our items. That would be good.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the other player's proposal is compatible. Since I can't know their values, maybe they would prefer to take the pan or die. But if they do, then my proposal would conflict. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe it's better to have a split where both get something. For example, if I take the pan and die, and they take the rings, that's a good split. If they take something else, maybe we can't get a complementary proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the pan and die, and if they don't accept, maybe I can adjust. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be careful. Maybe the first message is a secret proposal. Let me think about the possible messages.\n\nWait, the rules say that each player can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal at any time. So, maybe the first step is to make a secret proposal. Let me try that. My secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. Then, the other player would respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is to take the rings, then we can both get our items. If not, maybe we have to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't make a secret proposal and instead send messages, but the problem is that messages are public. So, if I send a message saying \"I want the pan and die,\" the other player can see that and might adjust their proposal. But since I can't know their values, it's risky. However, making a secret proposal might be better because it's hidden, so the other player can't see it until they make their own.\n\nBut the problem is that the other player might not know my proposal. So, maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal first. Let me go with that. So, my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Pan, 1 Die]. Then, the other player would have to respond with their own proposal. If they propose the rings, then we can both get our items. If they propose something else, like the pan, then we can't both have it, so we get zero. But since I don't know their values, maybe they would prefer the pan or die.

That would be a good split. So, I think making a secret proposal for pan and die is the way to go. Let me check the items again. There's 3 rings, 1 die, 1 pan. So, if I take pan and die, that's two items. The other player can take the 3 rings. That's complementary. So, that's a good proposal. I'll go with that.\n",
