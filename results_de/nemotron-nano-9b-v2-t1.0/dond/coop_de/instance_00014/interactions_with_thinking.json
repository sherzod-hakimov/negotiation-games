                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 2 mirrors, 1 brick, 3 knives, and 1 comb. My value function is mirrors:1, brick:4, knives:1, comb:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider what items are most valuable to me. The brick is worth 4, which is the highest. Then mirrors, knives, and comb are all 1 each. So I should prioritize getting the brick. But since the other player might also value the brick highly, I need to negotiate.\n\nThe rules say we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Each message is sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format. If our proposals are complementary (i.e., no overlapping items), we both get points based on our values. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo the key is to propose items that the other player might not want, or to split items in a way that both can get some high-value items. But since I don't know the other player's values, I have to make assumptions. Maybe the other player also values the brick highly. If that's the case, we need to split the brick, but there's only one. So maybe one of us gets the brick, and the other gets other items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values something else more. For example, if they value mirrors more, then I could take the brick and they take mirrors. But without knowing their values, it's tricky.\n\nSince I can send messages, maybe I should first try to communicate. But the problem is that messages are public, so the other player can see them. So if I send a message like \"I want the brick,\" they might respond accordingly. But since I can't see their messages, I have to make my own proposals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe making a secret proposal is better. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...], and if both are complementary, we get points. So maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some other items, hoping that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving room for the other player to get some items. For example, if I take the brick (4 points) and maybe some mirrors or knives, but leave the comb for them. But if they also want the brick, then my proposal would conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb, since the comb is only 1 point for me, but maybe the other player values it more. But again, without knowing their values, it's a guess.\n\nAnother approach: since the total items are limited, maybe the optimal is to split the items so that both get high-value items. For example, if I take the brick (4) and the comb (1), and the other player takes the mirrors (2*1=2) and knives (3*1=3), total would be 4+1+2+3=10. But if the other player's values are different, maybe they would prefer different items.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. Alternatively, send messages to negotiate.\n\nBut the problem is that the user is me, and I need to decide what to do. Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Let me think about possible strategies.\n\nIf I make a secret proposal, I need to choose items that I value highly. The brick is the most valuable. So maybe propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. That gives me 4+1=5 points. If the other player's proposal is complementary, they might get the remaining items. But if they also want the brick, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the brick and the comb. That's 4+1=5. If the other player's proposal is, say, mirrors and knives, then it's complementary. But if they also want the brick, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send messages to the other player to find out their preferences. But since messages are public, I can't really get that info. Unless I can infer from their responses. But in this scenario, I'm the one making the first move.\n\nWait, the user is me, and I need to start the negotiation. So I need to decide whether to send a message or make a secret proposal. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe making a secret proposal is better because it's a direct way to propose items without revealing too much. But I need to choose items that are likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, if I send a message like \"I want the brick,\" the other player might respond with their own proposal. But since I can't see their messages, I have to make my own proposals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some other items, and then see if the other player's proposal is compatible. For example, if I propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror], and the other player proposes [Proposal: 2 mirrors, 3 knives, 1 comb], then it's complementary. But if they also propose the brick, then it's a conflict.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. Maybe the other player also values the brick highly. So if I take the brick, they might not get it. But if I don't take it, maybe they do. So it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but might be more valuable to them. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard.\n\nAnother thought: the total value of all items is 2*1 (mirrors) + 1*4 (brick) + 3*1 (knives) + 1*1 (comb) = 2+4+3+1=10. If both players can get all items, the total would be 10. But since they have to split, the maximum possible sum is 10. But if they can't agree, they get zero. So the goal is to get as close to 10 as possible.\n\nSo the optimal is to have both players get all items. But since there are 2 mirrors, 1 brick, etc., the other player might need to take some items. So if I can propose items that the other player doesn't want, or split the items in a way that both get high-value items.\n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's challenging. Maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and hope that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict. For example, [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. If the other player's proposal is, say, 2 mirrors, 3 knives, 1 comb, then it's complementary. But if they also want the brick, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb, and the other player can take the rest. But again, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to ask about their preferences. But since messages are public, I can't really get that info. Unless I can infer from their responses. But in this case, I'm the one initiating.\n\nWait, the user is me, and I need to start. So I need to decide my first action. Should I send a message or make a secret proposal?\n\nIf I make a secret proposal, I can propose items that I value. Let's say I propose [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. That gives me 5 points. If the other player's proposal is complementary, they get the remaining items. But if they also want the brick, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, if I send a message like \"I want the brick,\" the other player might respond with their own proposal. But since I can't see their messages, I have to make my own proposals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some other items, and then the other player can respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is compatible, we both get points. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut since I can't know their values, I have to make a proposal that maximizes my own value while leaving room for the other player. For example, taking the brick (4) and maybe the comb (1), which is low value for me but maybe high for them. But again, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb, and the other player can take the mirrors and knives. That way, I get 4+1=5, and they get 2+3=5, total 10. That's the maximum possible. But this depends on the other player's values. If they value the comb more, then it's good. If they value the brick more, then they might not accept.\n\nBut since I don't know, maybe this is the best bet. So I should make a secret proposal of [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 comb]. That way, I get 5 points, and if the other player's proposal is the rest, they get 5. Total 10.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose the brick and the mirror, and they take the rest, same total. But maybe the other player's values are different. For example, if they value the comb more, then my proposal of brick and comb is better.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the safest is to propose the brick and some items, and hope the other player's proposal is compatible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a message to the other player to negotiate. For example, \"I want the brick. What do you want?\" But since messages are public, the other player can see that. But I can't know their response.\n\nBut the problem is that I have to make my own moves. So maybe the best is to make a secret proposal that includes the brick and some items, and then see if the other player's proposal is compatible.\n\nSo I think the best first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me go with [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 mirror]. That gives me 5 points. If the other player's proposal is, say, 2 mirrors, 3 knives, 1 comb, then it's complementary. But if they also want the brick, then it's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose the brick and the comb. That's 5 points. If the other player takes the mirrors and knives, that's 5. Total 10. That's ideal.\n\nBut again, it's a guess. Since I can't know, I have to make a proposal. So I'll go with [Proposal: 1 brick, 1 comb]. That way, I get 5, and if the other player's proposal is the rest, they get 5. Total 10. That's the maximum possible. So that's a good strategy.\n"
