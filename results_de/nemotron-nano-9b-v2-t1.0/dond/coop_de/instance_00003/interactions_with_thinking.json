                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 pockets, and 1 onion. My secret value function is carrot:3, pocket:1, onion:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one carrot and one onion, those are unique items. The pockets are four, so they can be split. The key is to find a complementary proposal where both get items without overlapping. \n\nIf I make a secret proposal, I need to list items in brackets. For example, if I propose [1 carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player should propose the remaining items: [1 onion, 2 pockets]. That would be complementary. But I don't know the other player's values. Maybe they value onions more than carrots, or vice versa. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot, onion], then the other player would need to take all 4 pockets. But if they value pockets highly, that could work. However, if they don't value pockets much, they might not accept. \n\nWait, but since the other player's values are secret, I have to make assumptions. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly and see if the other player can complement. For instance, if I take the carrot and onion, which are high value for me (3 each), totaling 6. Then the other player would need to take all 4 pockets. If they value pockets at 1 each, that's 4. Total sum would be 10. But if they value pockets more, say 2 each, then 8, total 14. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 2 pockets and the carrot, then the other player could take the onion and 2 pockets. My value would be 3+2=5, theirs 3+2=5, total 10. But again, depends on their values. \n\nBut since I can't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and hope the other player can complement. Alternatively, maybe propose a split that maximizes possible total value. \n\nAnother angle: the maximum possible total value if all items are allocated. Carrot (3) + onion (3) + 4 pockets (4*1=4) = 10. If both players can get all items, that's the max. But since each proposal must be complementary, maybe the best is to split the high-value items. \n\nBut since there's only one carrot and one onion, they can't both be taken. So one player gets carrot, the other onion. Then pockets can be split. \n\nSo maybe my proposal should be [carrot, 2 pockets], and the other player's proposal would be [onion, 2 pockets]. That way, all items are allocated. My value would be 3+2=5, theirs 3+2=5, total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take carrot and onion, but that's only possible if the other player takes all pockets. But if they don't value pockets, they might not accept. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the safest is to propose carrot and some pockets, and let the other player take onion and the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose just the carrot, and let the other player take onion and pockets. But then I get 3, they get 3+4=7, total 10. \n\nBut if I take carrot and 4 pockets, that's 3+4=7, but then the other player can't take onion because there's only one. Wait, no, if I take carrot and 4 pockets, then the other player can take onion. That would be complementary. My value 7, theirs 3, total 10. \n\nBut maybe the other player values onions more. If they value onion at 3, then total is 10. If they value it less, maybe they don't accept. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot], then the other player can take [onion, 4 pockets]. That's complementary. My value 3, theirs 3+4=7. Total 10. \n\nBut if I propose [carrot, 1 pocket], then the other player can take [onion, 3 pockets]. My value 3+1=4, theirs 3+3=6. Total 10. \n\nSo regardless of how I split the pockets, as long as the carrot and onion are split, the total is 10. But if I take both carrot and onion, that's 6, but then the other player can't take anything else, so they get 0. Total 6. Which is worse. \n\nSo the best is to split carrot and onion between us, and split the pockets. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, maybe I should propose taking the carrot and some pockets, and let them take the onion and the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 3 pockets], and they take [onion, 1 pocket]. My value 3+3=6, theirs 3+1=4. Total 10. \n\nBut again, depends on their values. \n\nSince I can't know, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value while allowing the other to take the remaining. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 4 pockets], which gives me 3+4=7, and they take onion. Their value 3. Total 10. \n\nBut if they value onion more, say 5, then they might prefer to take it. But since I don't know, I have to make a proposal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, onion], but that would require the other player to take all pockets. If they value pockets, that's good. If not, they might not accept. \n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to ensure that both proposals are complementary. So I need to make sure that the items I propose and the other's proposal don't overlap. \n\nSo, possible strategies:\n\n1. Propose carrot and some pockets, let them take onion and remaining pockets. \n\n2. Propose onion and some pockets, let them take carrot and remaining. \n\n3. Propose only carrot, let them take onion and pockets. \n\n4. Propose only onion, let them take carrot and pockets. \n\nWhich of these would maximize the total? \n\nIf I take carrot (3) and 4 pockets (4), total 7. They take onion (3). Total 10. \n\nIf I take carrot and 3 pockets (6), they take onion and 1 pocket (4). Total 10. \n\nSame total. \n\nIf I take carrot and 2 pockets (5), they take onion and 2 pockets (5). Total 10. \n\nSame. \n\nSo regardless of how I split the pockets, as long as carrot and onion are split, the total is 10. \n\nBut if I take both carrot and onion, then the other player can't take anything, so total is 6. Which is worse. \n\nTherefore, the optimal is to split carrot and onion, and split pockets. \n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, maybe I should propose taking the carrot and as many pockets as possible, so that even if they take the onion, the total is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 4 pockets], which gives me 7, and they take onion (3). Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [carrot], they take onion and 4 pockets (7). Total 10. \n\nEither way, the total is 10. \n\nBut maybe the other player's values are different. For example, if they value onions more than carrots. Suppose their onion is worth 5, and carrot 1. Then if I take carrot and 4 pockets (3+4=7), they take onion (5). Total 12. Which is better. \n\nBut since I don't know, I have to make a proposal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 2 pockets], and they take [onion, 2 pockets]. If their onion is 3 and pockets 1, total 5+5=10. \n\nBut if their onion is higher, say 5, then their value would be 5+2=7, mine 3+2=5, total 12. \n\nSo the total can vary. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value, assuming the other player will take the remaining. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 4 pockets], which is 7 for me, and they take onion (3). Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [onion, 4 pockets], which is 3+4=7, and they take carrot (3). Total 10. \n\nSame. \n\nBut maybe the other player's values are such that they prefer onions more. So if I take carrot and pockets, they take onion. \n\nAlternatively, if I take onion and pockets, they take carrot. \n\nBut without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make a proposal that allows for the highest possible total. \n\nThe maximum possible total is 3 (carrot) + 3 (onion) + 4*1 (pockets) = 10. \n\nSo any split that allocates all items would achieve this. \n\nTherefore, the key is to make a proposal that includes either carrot or onion, and some pockets, and the other player's proposal would take the remaining. \n\nSo, for example, I can propose [carrot, 2 pockets], and the other player would need to propose [onion, 2 pockets]. \n\nAlternatively, I can propose [carrot], and they propose [onion, 4 pockets]. \n\nEither way, the total is 10. \n\nBut since I can only make a secret proposal, I need to choose which items to propose. \n\nThe problem is that I don't know the other player's values. So maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player can complement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose a balanced split. \n\nBut since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to decide. \n\nLet me think about possible scenarios. \n\nIf I propose [carrot, 4 pockets], then the other player can take [onion]. That's complementary. My value 7, theirs 3. Total 10. \n\nIf I propose [carrot, 3 pockets], they take [onion, 1 pocket]. My value 6, theirs 4. Total 10. \n\nIf I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], they take [onion, 2 pockets]. My 5, theirs 5. Total 10. \n\nIf I propose [carrot, 1 pocket], they take [onion, 3 pockets]. My 4, theirs 6. Total 10. \n\nIf I propose [carrot], they take [onion, 4 pockets]. My 3, theirs 7. Total 10. \n\nSame total. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [onion, 4 pockets], they take [carrot]. My 7, theirs 3. Total 10. \n\nSame. \n\nSo regardless of how I split, as long as I take either carrot or onion and some pockets, and they take the other, the total is 10. \n\nBut if I propose both carrot and onion, then the other player can't take anything, so total is 6. \n\nSo the best is to split carrot and onion. \n\nTherefore, my secret proposal should be either [carrot, x pockets] or [onion, x pockets], where x is some number. \n\nBut which one? \n\nIf I take carrot, which is 3, and maybe some pockets. If I take onion, which is also 3. \n\nBut maybe the other player values onions more. For example, if their onion is worth 5, then taking onion would be better. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe it's safer to take the carrot, which I value 3, and let them take the onion. \n\nAlternatively, take the onion and some pockets. \n\nBut without knowing, it's a 50-50. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 2 pockets], which is 5 for me, and they take [onion, 2 pockets], which is 5 for them. Total 10. \n\nBut again, depends on their values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 3 pockets], which is 6 for me, and they take [onion, 1 pocket], which is 4. Total 10. \n\nBut if they value onions more, maybe they would prefer to take the onion and more pockets. \n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value, assuming the other player will take the remaining. \n\nSo, if I take carrot and 4 pockets (7), and they take onion (3). Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take onion and 4 pockets (7), they take carrot (3). Same total. \n\nBut maybe the other player's values are such that they prefer onions. \n\nBut since I can't know, perhaps the best is to propose [carrot, 4 pockets], as it gives me the highest possible value (7), and the other player gets 3. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [onion, 4 pockets], same thing. \n\nBut maybe the other player's values are such that they value onions more. \n\nBut without information, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 2 pockets], which is 5, and they take [onion, 2 pockets], which is 5. Total 10. \n\nThis way, even if their values are different, the total is 10. \n\nBut if they value onions more, say 5, then their value would be 5+2=7, mine 3+2=5, total 12. \n\nBut if they value onions less, say 2, then their value is 2+2=4, mine 5, total 9. \n\nSo it's variable. \n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make a proposal that allows for the highest possible sum. \n\nThe maximum possible is 10, which is achievable by splitting carrot and onion. \n\nTherefore, I should make a proposal that includes either carrot or onion, and some pockets, ensuring that the other player can take the remaining. \n\nSo, for example, I can propose [carrot, 2 pockets], and the other player would need to propose [onion, 2 pockets]. \n\nAlternatively, I can propose [carrot], and they take [onion, 4 pockets]. \n\nEither way, the total is 10. \n\nBut since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose. \n\nMaybe the best is to propose [carrot, 2 pockets], as it's a balanced split. \n\nAlternatively, propose [carrot, 3 pockets], which gives me more. \n\nBut if the other player values onions more, they might take the onion and more pockets. \n\nBut again, without knowing, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 1 pocket], and they take [onion, 3 pockets]. \n\nMy value 4, theirs 3+3=6. Total 10. \n\nSame. \n\nSo all these splits result in the same total. \n\nTherefore, any proposal that splits carrot and onion, and splits pockets, would work. \n\nBut since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose. \n\nMaybe the safest is to propose [carrot, 2 pockets], as it's a middle ground. \n\nAlternatively, propose [carrot, 4 pockets] to maximize my own value. \n\nBut if the other player values onions more, they might take the onion and pockets. \n\nBut since I can't know, I have to make a choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 3 pockets], which is 6 for me, and they take [onion, 1 pocket], which is 4. Total 10. \n\nBut again, same total. \n\nSo, in any case, the total is 10. \n\nTherefore, the key is to make a proposal that includes either carrot or onion, and some pockets. \n\nSo, I'll go with proposing [carrot, 2 pockets]. \n\nBut wait, the format is [Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, ...]. \n\nSo, for example, [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 2 pockets]. \n\nBut the numbers might refer to quantities. Wait, the items are 1 carrot, 4 pockets, 1 onion. So the numbers are the quantities. \n\nSo, if I propose [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 2 pockets], that means I want 1 carrot and 2 pockets. \n\nThen the other player would need to propose [1 onion, 2 pockets], which is complementary. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 3 pockets], then they need to propose [1 onion, 1 pocket]. \n\nEither way, the total is 10. \n\nSo, I think the best approach is to propose a split that includes the carrot and some pockets, and let the other player take the onion and the remaining pockets. \n\nTherefore, my secret proposal would be [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 2 pockets]. \n\nAlternatively, [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 3 pockets]. \n\nBut I need to choose. \n\nSince I value carrot 3 and pockets 1, taking more pockets gives me more value. So maybe [1 carrot, 3 pockets] (3+3=6) and they take [1 onion, 1 pocket] (3+1=4). Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, [1 carrot, 4 pockets] (3+4=7) and they take [1 onion] (3). Total 10. \n\nEither way, the total is 10. \n\nBut if I take more pockets, I get more value. \n\nSo maybe [1 carrot, 4 pockets] is better for me. \n\nBut the other player might not accept if they value onions more. \n\nBut since I can't know, I have to make a proposal. \n\nSo, I'll go with [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 4 pockets]. \n\nThat way, I get 7, and they get 3. Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if they value onions more, they might take the onion and pockets. \n\nBut since I can't know, this is the best I can do. \n\nSo, my secret proposal is [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 4 pockets].\n"
