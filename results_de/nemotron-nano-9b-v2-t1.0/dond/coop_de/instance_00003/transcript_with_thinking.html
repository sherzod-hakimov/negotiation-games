        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 1 carrot, 4 pockets, and 1 onion. My secret value function is carrot:3, pocket:1, onion:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>First, I should consider possible allocations. Since there&#x27;s only one carrot and one onion, those are unique items. The pockets are four, so they can be split. The key is to find a complementary proposal where both get items without overlapping. <br/><br/>If I make a secret proposal, I need to list items in brackets. For example, if I propose [1 carrot, 2 pockets], then the other player should propose the remaining items: [1 onion, 2 pockets]. That would be complementary. But I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. Maybe they value onions more than carrots, or vice versa. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [carrot, onion], then the other player would need to take all 4 pockets. But if they value pockets highly, that could work. However, if they don&#x27;t value pockets much, they might not accept. <br/><br/>Wait, but since the other player&#x27;s values are secret, I have to make assumptions. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly and see if the other player can complement. For instance, if I take the carrot and onion, which are high value for me (3 each), totaling 6. Then the other player would need to take all 4 pockets. If they value pockets at 1 each, that&#x27;s 4. Total sum would be 10. But if they value pockets more, say 2 each, then 8, total 14. But I don&#x27;t know. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take 2 pockets and the carrot, then the other player could take the onion and 2 pockets. My value would be 3+2=5, theirs 3+2=5, total 10. But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose items that I value highly and hope the other player can complement. Alternatively, maybe propose a split that maximizes possible total value. <br/><br/>Another angle: the maximum possible total value if all items are allocated. Carrot (3) + onion (3) + 4 pockets (4*1=4) = 10. If both players can get all items, that&#x27;s the max. But since each proposal must be complementary, maybe the best is to split the high-value items. <br/><br/>But since there&#x27;s only one carrot and one onion, they can&#x27;t both be taken. So one player gets carrot, the other onion. Then pockets can be split. <br/><br/>So maybe my proposal should be [carrot, 2 pockets], and the other player&#x27;s proposal would be [onion, 2 pockets]. That way, all items are allocated. My value would be 3+2=5, theirs 3+2=5, total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take carrot and onion, but that&#x27;s only possible if the other player takes all pockets. But if they don&#x27;t value pockets, they might not accept. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose carrot and some pockets, and let the other player take onion and the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose just the carrot, and let the other player take onion and pockets. But then I get 3, they get 3+4=7, total 10. <br/><br/>But if I take carrot and 4 pockets, that&#x27;s 3+4=7, but then the other player can&#x27;t take onion because there&#x27;s only one. Wait, no, if I take carrot and 4 pockets, then the other player can take onion. That would be complementary. My value 7, theirs 3, total 10. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player values onions more. If they value onion at 3, then total is 10. If they value it less, maybe they don&#x27;t accept. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [carrot], then the other player can take [onion, 4 pockets]. That&#x27;s complementary. My value 3, theirs 3+4=7. Total 10. <br/><br/>But if I propose [carrot, 1 pocket], then the other player can take [onion, 3 pockets]. My value 3+1=4, theirs 3+3=6. Total 10. <br/><br/>So regardless of how I split the pockets, as long as the carrot and onion are split, the total is 10. But if I take both carrot and onion, that&#x27;s 6, but then the other player can&#x27;t take anything else, so they get 0. Total 6. Which is worse. <br/><br/>So the best is to split carrot and onion between us, and split the pockets. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, maybe I should propose taking the carrot and some pockets, and let them take the onion and the rest. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 3 pockets], and they take [onion, 1 pocket]. My value 3+3=6, theirs 3+1=4. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value while allowing the other to take the remaining. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 4 pockets], which gives me 3+4=7, and they take onion. Their value 3. Total 10. <br/><br/>But if they value onion more, say 5, then they might prefer to take it. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, onion], but that would require the other player to take all pockets. If they value pockets, that&#x27;s good. If not, they might not accept. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to ensure that both proposals are complementary. So I need to make sure that the items I propose and the other&#x27;s proposal don&#x27;t overlap. <br/><br/>So, possible strategies:<br/><br/>1. Propose carrot and some pockets, let them take onion and remaining pockets. <br/><br/>2. Propose onion and some pockets, let them take carrot and remaining. <br/><br/>3. Propose only carrot, let them take onion and pockets. <br/><br/>4. Propose only onion, let them take carrot and pockets. <br/><br/>Which of these would maximize the total? <br/><br/>If I take carrot (3) and 4 pockets (4), total 7. They take onion (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>If I take carrot and 3 pockets (6), they take onion and 1 pocket (4). Total 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>If I take carrot and 2 pockets (5), they take onion and 2 pockets (5). Total 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>So regardless of how I split the pockets, as long as carrot and onion are split, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if I take both carrot and onion, then the other player can&#x27;t take anything, so total is 6. Which is worse. <br/><br/>Therefore, the optimal is to split carrot and onion, and split pockets. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values, maybe I should propose taking the carrot and as many pockets as possible, so that even if they take the onion, the total is maximized. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 4 pockets], which gives me 7, and they take onion (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [carrot], they take onion and 4 pockets (7). Total 10. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s values are different. For example, if they value onions more than carrots. Suppose their onion is worth 5, and carrot 1. Then if I take carrot and 4 pockets (3+4=7), they take onion (5). Total 12. Which is better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 2 pockets], and they take [onion, 2 pockets]. If their onion is 3 and pockets 1, total 5+5=10. <br/><br/>But if their onion is higher, say 5, then their value would be 5+2=7, mine 3+2=5, total 12. <br/><br/>So the total can vary. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value, assuming the other player will take the remaining. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 4 pockets], which is 7 for me, and they take onion (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [onion, 4 pockets], which is 3+4=7, and they take carrot (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they prefer onions more. So if I take carrot and pockets, they take onion. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take onion and pockets, they take carrot. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make a proposal that allows for the highest possible total. <br/><br/>The maximum possible total is 3 (carrot) + 3 (onion) + 4*1 (pockets) = 10. <br/><br/>So any split that allocates all items would achieve this. <br/><br/>Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that includes either carrot or onion, and some pockets, and the other player&#x27;s proposal would take the remaining. <br/><br/>So, for example, I can propose [carrot, 2 pockets], and the other player would need to propose [onion, 2 pockets]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose [carrot], and they propose [onion, 4 pockets]. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But since I can only make a secret proposal, I need to choose which items to propose. <br/><br/>The problem is that I don&#x27;t know the other player&#x27;s values. So maybe I should propose items that I value highly, and hope that the other player can complement. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose a balanced split. <br/><br/>But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to decide. <br/><br/>Let me think about possible scenarios. <br/><br/>If I propose [carrot, 4 pockets], then the other player can take [onion]. That&#x27;s complementary. My value 7, theirs 3. Total 10. <br/><br/>If I propose [carrot, 3 pockets], they take [onion, 1 pocket]. My value 6, theirs 4. Total 10. <br/><br/>If I propose [carrot, 2 pockets], they take [onion, 2 pockets]. My 5, theirs 5. Total 10. <br/><br/>If I propose [carrot, 1 pocket], they take [onion, 3 pockets]. My 4, theirs 6. Total 10. <br/><br/>If I propose [carrot], they take [onion, 4 pockets]. My 3, theirs 7. Total 10. <br/><br/>Same total. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [onion, 4 pockets], they take [carrot]. My 7, theirs 3. Total 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>So regardless of how I split, as long as I take either carrot or onion and some pockets, and they take the other, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if I propose both carrot and onion, then the other player can&#x27;t take anything, so total is 6. <br/><br/>So the best is to split carrot and onion. <br/><br/>Therefore, my secret proposal should be either [carrot, x pockets] or [onion, x pockets], where x is some number. <br/><br/>But which one? <br/><br/>If I take carrot, which is 3, and maybe some pockets. If I take onion, which is also 3. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player values onions more. For example, if their onion is worth 5, then taking onion would be better. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s safer to take the carrot, which I value 3, and let them take the onion. <br/><br/>Alternatively, take the onion and some pockets. <br/><br/>But without knowing, it&#x27;s a 50-50. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 2 pockets], which is 5 for me, and they take [onion, 2 pockets], which is 5 for them. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, depends on their values. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 3 pockets], which is 6 for me, and they take [onion, 1 pocket], which is 4. Total 10. <br/><br/>But if they value onions more, maybe they would prefer to take the onion and more pockets. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the best is to propose a split that maximizes my own value, assuming the other player will take the remaining. <br/><br/>So, if I take carrot and 4 pockets (7), and they take onion (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take onion and 4 pockets (7), they take carrot (3). Same total. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they prefer onions. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, perhaps the best is to propose [carrot, 4 pockets], as it gives me the highest possible value (7), and the other player gets 3. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [onion, 4 pockets], same thing. <br/><br/>But maybe the other player&#x27;s values are such that they value onions more. <br/><br/>But without information, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 2 pockets], which is 5, and they take [onion, 2 pockets], which is 5. Total 10. <br/><br/>This way, even if their values are different, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if they value onions more, say 5, then their value would be 5+2=7, mine 3+2=5, total 12. <br/><br/>But if they value onions less, say 2, then their value is 2+2=4, mine 5, total 9. <br/><br/>So it&#x27;s variable. <br/><br/>But since the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to make a proposal that allows for the highest possible sum. <br/><br/>The maximum possible is 10, which is achievable by splitting carrot and onion. <br/><br/>Therefore, I should make a proposal that includes either carrot or onion, and some pockets, ensuring that the other player can take the remaining. <br/><br/>So, for example, I can propose [carrot, 2 pockets], and the other player would need to propose [onion, 2 pockets]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I can propose [carrot], and they take [onion, 4 pockets]. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose. <br/><br/>Maybe the best is to propose [carrot, 2 pockets], as it&#x27;s a balanced split. <br/><br/>Alternatively, propose [carrot, 3 pockets], which gives me more. <br/><br/>But if the other player values onions more, they might take the onion and more pockets. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 1 pocket], and they take [onion, 3 pockets]. <br/><br/>My value 4, theirs 3+3=6. Total 10. <br/><br/>Same. <br/><br/>So all these splits result in the same total. <br/><br/>Therefore, any proposal that splits carrot and onion, and splits pockets, would work. <br/><br/>But since I have to make a secret proposal, I need to choose. <br/><br/>Maybe the safest is to propose [carrot, 2 pockets], as it&#x27;s a middle ground. <br/><br/>Alternatively, propose [carrot, 4 pockets] to maximize my own value. <br/><br/>But if the other player values onions more, they might take the onion and pockets. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a choice. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe propose [carrot, 3 pockets], which is 6 for me, and they take [onion, 1 pocket], which is 4. Total 10. <br/><br/>But again, same total. <br/><br/>So, in any case, the total is 10. <br/><br/>Therefore, the key is to make a proposal that includes either carrot or onion, and some pockets. <br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll go with proposing [carrot, 2 pockets]. <br/><br/>But wait, the format is [Vorschlag: &lt;Nummer&gt; &lt;Objektname&gt;, ...]. <br/><br/>So, for example, [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 2 pockets]. <br/><br/>But the numbers might refer to quantities. Wait, the items are 1 carrot, 4 pockets, 1 onion. So the numbers are the quantities. <br/><br/>So, if I propose [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 2 pockets], that means I want 1 carrot and 2 pockets. <br/><br/>Then the other player would need to propose [1 onion, 2 pockets], which is complementary. <br/><br/>Yes. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 3 pockets], then they need to propose [1 onion, 1 pocket]. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>So, I think the best approach is to propose a split that includes the carrot and some pockets, and let the other player take the onion and the remaining pockets. <br/><br/>Therefore, my secret proposal would be [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 2 pockets]. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 3 pockets]. <br/><br/>But I need to choose. <br/><br/>Since I value carrot 3 and pockets 1, taking more pockets gives me more value. So maybe [1 carrot, 3 pockets] (3+3=6) and they take [1 onion, 1 pocket] (3+1=4). Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, [1 carrot, 4 pockets] (3+4=7) and they take [1 onion] (3). Total 10. <br/><br/>Either way, the total is 10. <br/><br/>But if I take more pockets, I get more value. <br/><br/>So maybe [1 carrot, 4 pockets] is better for me. <br/><br/>But the other player might not accept if they value onions more. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal. <br/><br/>So, I&#x27;ll go with [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 4 pockets]. <br/><br/>That way, I get 7, and they get 3. Total 10. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if they value onions more, they might take the onion and pockets. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>So, my secret proposal is [Vorschlag: 1 carrot, 4 pockets].<br/></p>
