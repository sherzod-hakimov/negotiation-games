                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 3 pens, 2 eggs, and 1 battery. My value function is pen:1, egg:2, battery:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are limited items, especially the battery which is only one, that's a key item. The battery is worth 3 to me, so I probably want to get that. But if the other player also values it highly, we might need to negotiate.\n\nThe rules say we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. Each message is sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format. The key is that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., they don't overlap in items), then both get points based on their items. Otherwise, both get zero.\n\nSo, the challenge is to propose an allocation that the other player would accept, considering their unknown values. Since I don't know their values, I have to make assumptions or try to find a mutually beneficial split.\n\nLet me think about possible allocations. The battery is unique. If I take the battery, the other player can't. But maybe they value it more. Alternatively, maybe we can split other items. For example, pens and eggs. There are 3 pens and 2 eggs. If I take some pens and eggs, and the other player takes the rest, but we need to make sure that the total items in both proposals don't exceed the available quantities.\n\nWait, the problem says that the proposals must be complementary. So, for example, if I propose to take 2 pens and 1 egg, and the other player proposes to take 1 pen and 1 egg and the battery, then we need to check if the total pens (2+1=3), eggs (1+1=2), and battery (1) are all within the available quantities. That would be complementary. Then both get their items and sum their values.\n\nBut if the other player's proposal includes items that I also proposed, then it's not complementary, and both get zero. So the key is to find a proposal that the other player would accept, and that doesn't overlap with my proposal.\n\nSince I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe start by proposing to take the battery, since it's the most valuable to me. But if the other player also wants the battery, that would conflict. Alternatively, maybe propose to take the battery and some other items, but that might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take all the eggs and some pens. Since eggs are worth 2 to me, and pens are 1. If I take 2 eggs and 1 pen, that's 2*2 +1*1=5. Then the other player could take the remaining 2 pens and the battery. If their value for the battery is high, they might accept. But if they value the battery more than the pens, they might prefer to take the battery. But since I don't know their values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the battery and some eggs. But if I take the battery, the other player can't. But if they value the battery more, they might not accept. However, if I take the battery, and they take the eggs and pens, that could work. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to predict.\n\nAnother approach: since the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores, maybe we should aim for a split where both get as much as possible. For example, if I take the battery (3 points) and the other player takes the eggs (2*2=4) and pens (3*1=3), total sum would be 3+4+3=10. But that's assuming the other player's values are such that they can take the eggs and pens. However, if their values are different, maybe they would prefer different items.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe start by proposing to take the battery. Let me try that. So my first message would be a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Battery]. Then the other player would have to respond. If they accept, then I get the battery (3 points) and they get the rest. But if they don't accept, maybe they make a counter-proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose a split that includes the battery and some other items. For example, [Proposal: 1 Battery, 1 Egg]. That would give me 3 + 2 = 5 points. Then the other player could take the remaining 2 eggs and 2 pens. If their value for eggs is 2 each, that's 4, and pens 1 each, 2 pens would be 2. Total 6. So sum would be 5+6=11. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best approach is to propose the battery, as it's the highest value item for me. If they accept, great. If not, maybe they propose something else. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the eggs and pens, leaving the battery for the other player. But if the other player values the battery more, they might take it. But if I take the eggs and pens, I get 2*2 + 3*1 = 7 points. The other player would get the battery (3) and maybe some other items. But again, depends on their values.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the other player has their own secret value function. So I can't assume their values. Therefore, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted by the other player, regardless of their values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose a split that is mutually beneficial. For example, if I take the battery and the other player takes the eggs and pens. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard. Maybe the best strategy is to propose the battery, as it's the most valuable to me, and hope the other player is okay with that. If they don't accept, maybe they will propose something else, and I can adjust.\n\nSo my first move would be to make a secret proposal. Let me go with [Proposal: 1 Battery]. That's my first message. Then the other player would respond. If they accept, then we both get our items. If not, they might make a counter-proposal. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose a more balanced split. For example, [Proposal: 1 Battery, 1 Egg]. That way, I get 3+2=5, and the other player can take the remaining 1 egg and 3 pens. If their value for the egg is 2, that's 2, and pens 3*1=3, total 5. So sum would be 5+5=10. But again, depends on their values.\n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the safest bet is to take the battery. Let me proceed with that.\n"
