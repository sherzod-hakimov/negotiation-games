Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n1 Stift, 1 Blume, 3 Rahmen\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nStift: 4, Blume: 0, Rahmen: 2\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format. Verwenden Sie keine eckigen Klammern, wenn Sie mit dem anderen Spieler kommunizieren, sonst wird dies als Ihr geheimer Vorschlag interpretiert.\n"

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 pen, 1 flower, and 3 frames. My secret value function is pen:4, flower:0, frame:2. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one pen and one flower, those can't be split. The frames are three, so maybe split them between us. But how?\n\nThe key is that both players need to make secret proposals. If the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they request don't overlap and there are enough items), then both get their items' values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the challenge is to propose items in a way that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, but also considering their possible values.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's values, I need to make assumptions. Maybe they value the pen highly, or maybe the frames. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose to take the pen and some frames, and the other player proposes the flower and the remaining frames, that could work. But if they value the pen more than me, they might want it. Alternatively, if they value the flower, but I don't, maybe I can take the pen and frames, and they take the flower. But since the flower is worthless to me, maybe I can let them have it if it's beneficial for them.\n\nWait, but the flower is worth 0 to me. So if I can get the pen and frames, and they get the flower, that might be good. But if they value the flower, they might want it. However, since I don't care about the flower, maybe I can propose to take the pen and frames, and they can take the flower. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the pen more. If I propose to take the pen, they might also want it. So maybe I should propose to take the frames and let them take the pen and flower. But if they value the pen, that's better for them. But if I take the pen, I get 4, and they get the flower (0) and maybe some frames. But if they take the pen, they might get more points. \n\nThis is tricky. Since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let's think about possible proposals.\n\nOption 1: I propose [Pen, 2 Frames]. Then the other player could propose [Flower, 1 Frame]. That would be complementary. My score would be 4 + 2*2 = 8, theirs would be 0 + 1*2 = 2. Total 10.\n\nOption 2: I propose [Pen, 3 Frames]. Then they might propose [Flower]. That's complementary. My score 4 + 3*2 = 10, theirs 0. Total 10.\n\nOption 3: I propose [Flower, 3 Frames]. But since the flower is worthless to me, that's not good. Unless they value it. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Pen, Flower, 3 Frames]. But that's all items. Then the other player can't propose anything, so it's not complementary. So that would result in zero for both. Not good.\n\nSo the best approach is to propose items that the other player might not want, or that they can take the remaining. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the pen and some frames, and let them take the flower. But if they value the pen, they might not accept. Alternatively, maybe propose the frames and let them take the pen and flower. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the pen and the flower. But since the flower is worthless to me, that's not helpful. Unless they value it. But I can't know.\n\nAnother angle: since the total points are the sum of both players' scores, I need to maximize that. So if I can get the pen and some frames, and they get the flower and remaining frames, that might be good. But if they value the pen, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose to take the pen and 1 frame, and they propose the flower and 2 frames. That would be complementary. My score 4 + 2 = 6, theirs 0 + 2*2 = 4. Total 10. \n\nBut if they value the pen more, they might not accept. But since I can't know, maybe the safest is to propose the pen and some frames, and let them take the flower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the frames and let them take the pen and flower.

So I need to list the items I want. \n\nIf I propose [Proposal: 1 Pen, 2 Frames], then the other player might propose [Flower, 1 Frame]. That would work. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 3 Frames], then they might take the pen and flower. \n\nBut which is better? If I take 3 frames, I get 3*2=6. If they take the pen (4) and flower (0), total 10. If I take 2 frames (4) and pen (4), total 8, and they take flower and 1 frame (2), total 10. \n\nSo both options give total 10. But if I take 3 frames, I get 6, they get 4. If I take 2 frames and pen, I get 8, they get 2. So the second option is better for me. \n\nBut the problem is that the other player might not agree.
