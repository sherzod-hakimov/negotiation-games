                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 pen, 1 flower, and 3 frames. My secret value function is pen:4, flower:0, frame:2. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one pen and one flower, those can't be split. The frames are three, so maybe split them between us. But how?\n\nThe key is that both players need to make secret proposals. If the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items they request don't overlap and there are enough items), then both get their items' values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the challenge is to propose items in a way that the other player's proposal doesn't conflict, but also considering their possible values.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's values, I need to make assumptions. Maybe they value the pen highly, or maybe the frames. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nIf I propose to take the pen and some frames, and the other player proposes the flower and the remaining frames, that could work. But if they value the pen more than me, they might want it. Alternatively, if they value the flower, but I don't, maybe I can take the pen and frames, and they take the flower. But since the flower is worthless to me, maybe I can let them have it if it's beneficial for them.\n\nWait, but the flower is worth 0 to me. So if I can get the pen and frames, and they get the flower, that might be good. But if they value the flower, they might want it. However, since I don't care about the flower, maybe I can propose to take the pen and frames, and they can take the flower. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn't conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player values the pen more. If I propose to take the pen, they might also want it. So maybe I should propose to take the frames and let them take the pen and flower. But if they value the pen, that's better for them. But if I take the pen, I get 4, and they get the flower (0) and maybe some frames. But if they take the pen, they might get more points. \n\nThis is tricky. Since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Let's think about possible proposals.\n\nOption 1: I propose [Pen, 2 Frames]. Then the other player could propose [Flower, 1 Frame]. That would be complementary. My score would be 4 + 2*2 = 8, theirs would be 0 + 1*2 = 2. Total 10.\n\nOption 2: I propose [Pen, 3 Frames]. Then they might propose [Flower]. That's complementary. My score 4 + 3*2 = 10, theirs 0. Total 10.\n\nOption 3: I propose [Flower, 3 Frames]. But since the flower is worthless to me, that's not good. Unless they value it. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Pen, Flower, 3 Frames]. But that's all items. Then the other player can't propose anything, so it's not complementary. So that would result in zero for both. Not good.\n\nSo the best approach is to propose items that the other player might not want, or that they can take the remaining. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose the pen and some frames, and let them take the flower. But if they value the pen, they might not accept. Alternatively, maybe propose the frames and let them take the pen and flower. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the pen and the flower. But since the flower is worthless to me, that's not helpful. Unless they value it. But I can't know.\n\nAnother angle: since the total points are the sum of both players' scores, I need to maximize that. So if I can get the pen and some frames, and they get the flower and remaining frames, that might be good. But if they value the pen, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose to take the pen and 1 frame, and they propose the flower and 2 frames. That would be complementary. My score 4 + 2 = 6, theirs 0 + 2*2 = 4. Total 10. \n\nBut if they value the pen more, they might not accept. But since I can't know, maybe the safest is to propose the pen and some frames, and let them take the flower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the frames and let them take the pen and flower. If they value the pen, that's good for them. But if they don't, they might take the flower. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe the best is to propose the pen and frames, and they can take the flower. But I need to make sure that their proposal doesn't conflict. \n\nSo my first message should be a secret proposal. Let me think. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to list the items I want. \n\nIf I propose [Proposal: 1 Pen, 2 Frames], then the other player might propose [Flower, 1 Frame]. That would work. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 3 Frames], then they might take the pen and flower. \n\nBut which is better? If I take 3 frames, I get 3*2=6. If they take the pen (4) and flower (0), total 10. If I take 2 frames (4) and pen (4), total 8, and they take flower and 1 frame (2), total 10. \n\nSo both options give total 10. But if I take 3 frames, I get 6, they get 4. If I take 2 frames and pen, I get 8, they get 2. So the second option is better for me. \n\nBut the problem is that the other player might not agree. If they value the pen more, they might not accept my proposal. But since I can't know, maybe I should propose the pen and 2 frames. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the pen and 1 frame. Then they can take the flower and 2 frames. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAnother thought: since the flower is worthless to me, maybe I should let them have it. So I can propose to take the pen and all 3 frames. Then they can take the flower. That would be complementary. My score 4 + 3*2 = 10, theirs 0. Total 10. \n\nBut if they value the pen, they might not accept. But if they don't, then it's good. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose to take the pen and 2 frames, and they take the flower and 1 frame. That's also 10. \n\nBut which is better? If I take 3 frames, I get 6, but if I take 2 frames and pen, I get 8. So the latter is better. \n\nBut the problem is that the other player might not accept. However, since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to propose the pen and 2 frames. \n\nSo my first message would be a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Pen, 2 Frames]. \n\nThen the other player would respond with their proposal. If they propose the flower and 1 frame, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if they propose something else, like the pen, then it's not complementary. \n\nBut since I can't know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the pen and 1 frame. Then they can take the flower and 2 frames. \n\nBut again, same total. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best is to propose the pen and 2 frames. \n\nSo I'll go with that. Let me write the secret proposal.\n",
