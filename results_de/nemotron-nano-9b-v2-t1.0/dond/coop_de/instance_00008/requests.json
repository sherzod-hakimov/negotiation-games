Jeder von Ihnen erhält außerdem eine geheime Wertfunktion, die angibt, wie viel Ihnen jede Art von Gegenstand wert ist.\n(b) Sie tauschen Nachrichten mit dem anderen Spieler aus, um zu vereinbaren, wer welche Gegenstände bekommt. Sie können jeweils maximal 5 Nachrichten senden oder das Spiel vorzeitig beenden, indem Sie jederzeit einen geheimen Vorschlag machen.\n(c) Jeder von euch wird aufgefordert, einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, in dem ihr die gewünschten Gegenstände in eckigen Klammern wie folgt angibt: \"[Vorschlag: <Nummer> <Objektname>, <Nummer> <Objektname>, <...>]\"\n(d) Wenn eure Vorschläge komplementär sind, d.h. es gibt genug Gegenstände, um beide Vorschläge zu erfüllen, erhält jeder Spieler eine Punktzahl, die sich aus der Summe der Werte für die Gegenstände ergibt, die er erhalten hat. Andernfalls erhalten Sie beide null Punkte.\n(e) Ihr Ziel ist es, die Summe aus Ihrer Punktzahl und der Punktzahl des anderen Spielers zu maximieren.\n\nBeginnen wir.\n\nDie Menge der verfügbaren Gegenstände ist:\n\n3 Scheren, 1 Fingerhut, 1 Gabel\n\nDeine geheime Wertfunktion ist:\n\nSchere: 3, Fingerhut: 0, Gabel: 1\n\nWICHTIG: Ihre Nachrichten werden, sofern es sich nicht um einen geheimen Vorschlag handelt, direkt an den anderen Spieler übermittelt, also fügen Sie keine Antwort auf die Regeln oder einen Text zur Ankündigung Ihrer Nachricht ein. Um einen geheimen Vorschlag zu machen, verwenden Sie das angegebene Format.

            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 3 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork. My value function is scissors:3, glove:0, fork:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are 3 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork, the total items are 5. Each player can get some combination. But since the other player's values are unknown, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. \n\nMy value for scissors is high (3), so I want as many as possible. The glove is worthless to me, so maybe I can give that to the other player. The fork is worth 1, so maybe keep it or trade it depending on the other's value.\n\nBut since I don't know the other's values, I need to make a proposal that's attractive to them. Maybe offer the glove and fork, which might be valuable to them. Alternatively, offer scissors. But if I offer too many scissors, maybe they don't want them. \n\nWait, the key is that the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose something, the other player's proposal should cover the remaining items. For example, if I take 2 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork, then the other player would need to take 1 scissor. But if their value for scissors is low, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me. That way, the other player might be more willing to take the scissors. But I need to think about possible scenarios.\n\nAnother approach: since I have a high value for scissors, I should try to get as many as possible. But the other player might also value scissors. If I take all 3 scissors, then the other player can't get any. But if their value for scissors is high, they might not accept. So maybe a compromise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe split the scissors. For example, I take 2 scissors, and the other takes 1. Then, the glove and fork can be split. But since there's only one of each, maybe I take the glove and fork, and the other takes the remaining scissors. \n\nBut I need to make a secret proposal. The format is [Proposal: <number> <item>, ...]. So I need to decide what to propose. \n\nIf I propose taking 2 scissors, 1 glove, and 1 fork, that's 4 items. The other player would need to take 1 scissor. If their value for scissors is high, they might accept. But if they value scissors low, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose taking 1 scissor, 1 glove, and 1 fork, then the other player would take 2 scissors. That might be better if they value scissors more. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted. Maybe offering the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me, and taking the scissors. \n\nWait, but the other player's value for the glove is unknown. If they value the glove highly, then giving it to me would be bad. But since I don't know, maybe I should propose taking the glove and fork, and the other player can take the scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking all the scissors. But that might not be complementary if the other player also wants them. \n\nHmm. The problem is that without knowing the other's values, it's tricky. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose a split that covers all items. For example, I take 2 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork. The other takes 1 scissor. That way, all items are allocated. \n\nBut if the other player's value for scissors is low, they might not accept. However, if they accept, then the sum would be my value (2*3 + 0 +1 =7) plus their value (1* their scissors value). If their scissors value is, say, 2, then total is 9. If they don't accept, then both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose taking 1 scissor, 1 glove, 1 fork, then the other takes 2 scissors. My value would be 3 +0 +1=4, and theirs would be 2* their scissors value. If their scissors value is 3, then total is 4+6=10. But if their value is 1, then 4+2=6. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best is to propose a split that covers all items. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Scissors, 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. Then the other player would need to take 1 Scissor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 3 scissors. But then the other player can't take any, so unless they have a low value for scissors, they might not accept. \n\nBut since the other player's values are secret, I have to make an educated guess. Since my value for scissors is high, I should try to get as many as possible. But if the other player also values scissors, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me. That way, the other player can take the scissors. If they value scissors highly, they would accept. \n\nSo my proposal could be [Proposal: 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. Then the other player would need to take 3 scissors. If their value for scissors is high, they would accept. \n\nBut if they don't, then we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a balanced proposal. For example, [Proposal: 1 Scissor, 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. Then the other player takes 2 scissors. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAnother thought: since the other player's values are secret, maybe the best strategy is to propose a split that maximizes my own value while leaving enough for the other player to accept. \n\nIf I take 2 scissors, 1 glove, 1 fork, that's 4 items. The other player takes 1 scissor. If they accept, my score is 2*3 +0 +1=7. Their score is 1* their scissors value. If their value is, say, 2, then total is 9. If they don't accept, both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, if I take 1 scissor, 1 glove, 1 fork, then the other takes 2 scissors. My score is 3 +0 +1=4. Their score is 2* their scissors value. If their value is 3, total is 10. If their value is 1, total is 6. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the best is to propose taking the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me, and let the other player take the scissors. \n\nSo my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. That way, the other player can take the 3 scissors. If they value scissors highly, they would accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 2 scissors and the glove. Then the other player takes 1 scissor and the fork. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's a gamble. \n\nSince the goal is to maximize the sum, I need to find a proposal that is likely to be accepted. If I propose taking the glove and fork, which are less valuable to me, the other player might be more willing to take the scissors. \n\nSo I think my first proposal should be [Proposal: 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. That way, the other player can take the 3 scissors. If they accept, my score is 0 +1=1 (since glove is 0, fork is 1), and their score is 3* their scissors value. If their value is, say, 2, then total is 1 + 6=7. If they don't accept, both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose taking 3 scissors, then the other player can't take any. But if they value scissors, they might not accept. \n\nBut since I don't know, maybe the safest is to propose the glove and fork. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 1 scissor, 1 glove, 1 fork. That way, the other player takes 2 scissors. \n\nBut again, it's a guess. \n\nI think the key is to make a proposal that covers all items, so that the other player can take the remaining. So my proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Scissors, 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. Then the other player takes 1 Scissor. \n\nBut if they don't accept, then we both get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 1 Scissor, 1 Glove, 1 Fork. \n\nBut I need to decide. Since I have a high value for scissors, I should try to get as many as possible. But if the other player also values them, they might not accept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking 2 scissors and the fork. Then the other player takes 1 scissor and the glove. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to propose a split that includes the items I value less, so that the other player can take the items I value more. \n\nSo, I'll propose [Proposal: 1 Glove, 1 Fork]. That way, the other player can take the 3 scissors. If they accept, my score is 0 +1=1, and theirs is 3* their value. If their value is high, that's good. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 Scissor, 1 Glove, 1 Fork], then the other player takes 2 scissors. \n\nBut I think the first proposal is better because it leaves more scissors for the other player, which might be more valuable to them. \n\nSo I'll go with [Proposal: 1 Glove, 1 Fork].\n",
