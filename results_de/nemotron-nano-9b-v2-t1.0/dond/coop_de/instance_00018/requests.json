            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, and 2 potatoes. Both players have secret value functions, but in this case, my value function is given as all items worth 2 each. The other player's value function isn't specified, so I have to assume it's different, but maybe similar? Or maybe it's arbitrary. Hmm.\n\nThe rules say that we can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: number item, ...]. If the proposals are complementary (i.e., the items don't overlap and there are enough items), then both get points based on their values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that the other player will accept, ensuring that the items are split without conflict.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. But how? Maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think about possible splits.\n\nThe items are 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes. So possible splits could be:\n\n- I take the coin and one envelope, the other takes the other envelope and both potatoes. But wait, there are only 2 envelopes. So if I take one, the other can take the other. Similarly for potatoes. But the coin is only one. So if I take the coin, the other can't. So maybe the coin is a point of contention.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the envelopes and potatoes. For example, I take both envelopes and one potato, the other takes the coin and the other potato. But that would require the other player to accept that. But since their values are unknown, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and one envelope. Then the other player would need to take the remaining envelope and both potatoes. But if their value for the coin is high, they might not accept. But since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose something that's a fair split, or maybe take the most valuable items for me.\n\nWait, but my value function is all 2s. So each item is equally valuable to me. So maybe I should try to get as many items as possible. But the other player's values could be different. For example, if they value the coin more, they might want to take it. But since I don't know, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and one envelope. Then the other player would have to take the other envelope and both potatoes. If their value for the coin is low, they might accept. But if it's high, they might not. But since I can't know, maybe I should make a proposal that's balanced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking both envelopes and one potato. Then the other player would take the coin and the other potato. But again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and both potatoes. Then the other player would take the two envelopes. But if they value the coin highly, they might not accept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking one envelope and one potato. Then the other player would take the coin, the other envelope, and the other potato. But again, depends on their values.\n\nSince I can't know the other player's values, maybe the best approach is to make a proposal that is as balanced as possible, or take the items that are less likely to be contested. But since all items are equally valuable to me, maybe I should just propose taking all items, but that would leave nothing for the other player, which would result in zero points. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and one envelope. Then the other player would need to take the remaining envelope and both potatoes. If their value for the coin is not too high, they might accept. But if they value the coin more, they might not. But since I can't know, maybe this is a reasonable first proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a message to the other player to see what they value. But the rules say that messages are sent directly, and I can't add text. So I can only send messages that are either secret proposals or regular messages. But the problem is that I can't ask questions. So maybe the best approach is to make a secret proposal.\n\nWait, the rules say that each player can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making a secret proposal. Let me think of a possible proposal.\n\nIf I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope], then the other player would need to propose something that doesn't conflict. For example, they could propose [Proposal: 1 envelope, 2 potatoes]. Then the total items would be 1 coin, 2 envelopes, 2 potatoes, which matches the available items. So that would be complementary. Then both would get their items. Since my value is 2 for each, I would get 2+2=4. The other player's value would depend on their function. But since I don't know, but the goal is to maximize the sum. If their value for the envelope and potatoes is also 2 each, then their total would be 2+2+2=6. So total sum would be 4+6=10. But if their values are different, maybe higher or lower. But since I can't know, maybe this is a safe proposal.\n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Proposal: 1 coin, 2 envelopes], then the other player would need to take the 2 potatoes. But that would require them to have a proposal that includes 2 potatoes. If they do, then it's complementary. But if they don't, then it's not. But again, without knowing their values, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: 2 envelopes, 1 potato]. Then the other player would need to take the coin and the other potato. That would be complementary. So that's another possible proposal.\n\nBut since I don't know the other player's values, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Since all items are equally valuable to me, maybe I should take the coin and one envelope, leaving the other envelope and both potatoes for the other player. That way, if their value for the coin is not too high, they might accept. Alternatively, if they value the coin more, they might not. But since I can't know, this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and both potatoes. Then the other player would need to take the two envelopes. If they value the envelopes more, they might accept. But again, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking one envelope and one potato. Then the other player would take the coin, the other envelope, and the other potato. That's a balanced split. But again, depends on their values.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is as likely as possible to be accepted. Since I can't know the other's values, maybe a proposal that splits the items evenly. For example, I take 1 coin, 1 envelope, 1 potato. The other takes 1 envelope and 1 potato. But that would require the other player to have a proposal that includes those items. But since the other player's proposal is secret, I can't know. However, if I make a proposal that is complementary, then it's possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the other player's proposal is also secret. So if I make a proposal, and they make a proposal, and they are complementary, then both get points. Otherwise, zero. So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player's proposal.\n\nBut since I don't know their proposal, maybe I should make a proposal that is as flexible as possible. For example, proposing to take the coin and one envelope. Then the other player could propose taking the other envelope and both potatoes. That would be complementary. Alternatively, if they propose something else, it might not be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking the coin and both potatoes. Then the other player would need to take the two envelopes. If they do, then it's complementary. But if they don't, then it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose taking one envelope and one potato.

That would be complementary.\n\nBut since I can't know, maybe the best is to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted.

But the rules say that messages are sent directly, and I can't add text. So I can only send messages that are either secret proposals or regular messages. But the problem is that I can't ask questions. So maybe the best is to make a secret proposal.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best first move is to make a secret proposal. Let me choose [Proposal: 1 coin, 1 envelope]. That way, if the other player's proposal is to take the remaining envelope and both potatoes, it's complementary. If their proposal is different, maybe not. But this is a starting point.\n",
