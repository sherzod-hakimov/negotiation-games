            "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 2 Bells, 1 Doll, and 2 Ribbons. My value function is Bell:1, Doll:2, Ribbon:3. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there are limited items, especially the Doll which is only one, that might be a key point. If both players want the Doll, there's a conflict. But since we need complementary proposals, we have to split the items without overlap.\n\nMy strategy should be to propose items that I value highly, but also consider what the other player might value. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should start by proposing items that are high in my value but maybe not too high for them. Alternatively, maybe propose items that are less likely to be contested.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get the sum of our values. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to find a split where both can get items without overlapping. \n\nLet me list all possible items and their quantities. Bells: 2, Doll:1, Ribbons:2. So total items are 5. Each player can take some, but the sum of their items must not exceed the available quantities.\n\nPossible splits could be:\n\n- One player takes the Doll, the other takes the rest. But since there are two Bells and two Ribbons, maybe split those. For example, Player A takes Doll and one Bell and one Ribbon, Player B takes one Bell and one Ribbon. But that would require that the Doll is only in one proposal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the Doll between them? No, because there's only one. So the Doll must go to one player. So the main conflict is over the Doll. \n\nIf I propose to take the Doll, then the other player might also propose to take it, leading to a conflict. But if I don't take the Doll, maybe the other player will take it, but then I can take other items. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary. Maybe propose items that are high in my value but not too high for them. For example, if I propose the Doll and a Ribbon, but if the other player values Ribbons more, they might take that. Alternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Bell, but again, depends on their values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them. But since I don't know their values, this is tricky. \n\nAnother approach: since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe we should aim for a split where both get as much as possible. For example, if I take the Doll and one Ribbon, and the other takes the other Ribbon and both Bells. But that would require that the other player's proposal includes the Bells and the remaining Ribbon. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I need to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted. Maybe start by proposing the Doll and a Ribbon. If the other player's proposal includes the other Ribbon and the Bells, then it's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Bell. If the other player takes the other Bell and the Ribbons, that could work. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be efficient. The first message could be a secret proposal. Let me think about what to propose. \n\nIf I propose [Proposal: Doll, Ribbon], then the other player might propose something else. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: Bell, Ribbon]. But if the other player also wants the Doll, that might not be good. \n\nWait, but the Doll is only one. So if I don't take it, the other player might. But if I take it, they might not. \n\nAnother thought: since the Doll is worth 2 to me, and maybe more to them. If I take the Doll, I get 2 points. If I don't, maybe they take it and get more. But without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose to take the Doll and a Ribbon. If the other player's proposal includes the other Ribbon and the Bells, then it's complementary. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the total items are enough. For example, if I take Doll and Ribbon, and they take the other Ribbon and both Bells, that's 1+1=2 Ribbons, 2 Bells, and 1 Doll. That works. \n\nSo my first secret proposal could be [Proposal: Doll, Ribbon]. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be careful. Maybe start with a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. The secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I should send that as my first message. \n\nAlternatively, maybe send a regular message first to ask about their values, but the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the specific format. \n\nWait, the rules say that messages are sent to the other player, and secret proposals are in the format. So if I send a message that's not a secret proposal, it's just a regular message. But the user's instruction says that when communicating with the other player, I shouldn't include any response to the rules or announcement. So I need to just send messages or secret proposals. \n\nSo the first step is to make a secret proposal. Let me decide what to propose. \n\nIf I propose the Doll and a Ribbon, that's two items. The other player might propose the other Ribbon and the Bells. That would be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose the Doll and a Bell, and they propose the other Bell and the Ribbons. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high in my value. The Ribbon is worth 3, which is the highest. So maybe take the Ribbon and the Doll. \n\nBut if the other player also values the Ribbon highly, they might take it. But if I take one Ribbon, they can take the other. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the Doll and both Bells. But that would leave the Ribbons for the other player. \n\nBut again, without knowing their values, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Ribbon. Let me go with that. So my first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: Doll, Ribbon]. \n\nThen, the other player would respond with their own proposal. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. If not, we get zero. \n\nBut since I can't know their proposal, I have to make a best guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose the Doll and a Bell. But again, same issue. \n\nAnother angle: the total value for me is 1+2+3=6. If I can get all items, I get 6. But the other player might also want some. But since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe we should split the items so that both get as much as possible. \n\nFor example, if I take the Doll (2) and a Ribbon (3), total 5. The other player could take the other Ribbon (3) and the two Bells (1+1=2), total 5. Sum is 10. That's good. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the Doll and both Bells (2+1+1=4), and the other takes the two Ribbons (3+3=6), sum is 10. \n\nEither way, the sum is 10. So maybe that's the maximum possible. \n\nBut to achieve that, the proposals need to be complementary. So if I propose [Doll, Bell, Bell], and they propose [Ribbon, Ribbon], that's complementary. \n\nBut if I propose [Doll, Ribbon], and they propose [Bell, Bell, Ribbon], that's also complementary. \n\nSo maybe the best approach is to propose items that cover different parts of the inventory. \n\nSince I can only send 5 messages, I need to make sure that my proposals are efficient. \n\nSo my first secret proposal could be [Proposal: Doll, Ribbon]. Then, if the other player's proposal is [Bell, Bell, Ribbon], that's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if they propose [Bell, Ribbon], then we have overlapping Ribbon, which is bad. \n\nBut since I don't know their values, I have to make an educated guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe propose [Proposal: Doll, Bell]. Then, if they propose [Ribbon, Ribbon], that's complementary. \n\nBut again, depends on their values. \n\nSince I can't know, maybe the safest is to propose the Doll and a Ribbon, as those are high value for me. \n\nSo I'll start with that. \n\n[Proposal: Doll, Ribbon]\n",
