        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 2 pens, 2 shoes, and 2 fruits. My secret value function is pen:4, shoe:1, fruit:0. So pens are really valuable to me, shoes a bit, and fruits not at all.<br/><br/>First, I should consider what the other player might value. Since their value function is secret, I have to make assumptions. Maybe they also value pens highly, or maybe shoes more. But since I don&#x27;t know, I need to propose something that could be mutually beneficial.<br/><br/>The rules say that if our proposals are complementary (i.e., there are enough items to satisfy both), we both get points based on our own values. Otherwise, we get zero. So the key is to find a proposal that the other player would accept, and that together we can cover all items without overlap.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to start by communicating. But the first move is to make a secret proposal. Wait, the instructions say that each player is asked to make a secret proposal. So maybe I should start by making my secret proposal first.<br/><br/>But how do I structure my proposal? The format is [Proposal: &lt;number&gt; &lt;item name&gt;, ...]. So I need to list the items I want, each with a number. Since there are 2 of each item, I can propose up to 2 of each. But I need to think about what to propose.<br/><br/>If I propose taking both pens, that&#x27;s 2 pens. But if the other player also wants pens, that would conflict. Alternatively, maybe I can propose pens and shoes, but since shoes are less valuable to me, maybe I should prioritize pens.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a mix. Let me think. If I take both pens, that&#x27;s 8 points for me. If the other player takes shoes and fruits, but since fruits are worthless to me, maybe they would take shoes. But if they take shoes, that&#x27;s 2 shoes, which is 2 points for them. But if I take pens, and they take shoes, that&#x27;s complementary. But I need to make sure that the total items are enough.<br/><br/>Wait, the items are 2 pens, 2 shoes, 2 fruits. So if I take 2 pens, and the other player takes 2 shoes, that&#x27;s 4 items, leaving 2 fruits. But the other player might also want fruits, but since they are worthless to me, maybe they don&#x27;t care. But if they take shoes, that&#x27;s 2 shoes. So total items would be 2 pens + 2 shoes = 4, leaving 2 fruits. But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal must also be complementary. So if I propose 2 pens, and they propose 2 shoes, then together we have 2 pens and 2 shoes, which is possible. Then I get 8 points, they get 2 points (if their value for shoes is 1 each). But if their value for shoes is higher, maybe they would prefer that. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I have to make an assumption.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 2 shoes. But that would take all pens and shoes, leaving fruits. But if the other player also wants pens or shoes, that would conflict. So maybe that&#x27;s not a good idea.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 0 shoes, 0 fruits. Then the other player could take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. But if they take shoes, that&#x27;s 2 shoes. If their value for shoes is 1 each, that&#x27;s 2 points. But if they value shoes more, maybe they would take them. But since I don&#x27;t know, I have to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 1 shoe. But that might not be optimal. Wait, but the other player might not want to take shoes if they have a different value function. For example, if they value shoes more than pens, they might prefer to take shoes. But since I don&#x27;t know, I need to make a proposal that is as attractive as possible.<br/><br/>Another approach: since fruits are worthless to me, maybe I should leave them for the other player. But if they don&#x27;t value them, that&#x27;s fine. So maybe I should focus on pens and shoes.<br/><br/>But how to structure the proposal. Let me think about possible proposals.<br/><br/>Option 1: Propose 2 pens. Then the other player might propose 2 shoes. That would be complementary. I get 8, they get 2 (if their shoe value is 1). Total 10.<br/><br/>Option 2: Propose 2 pens and 2 shoes. But then the other player can&#x27;t take anything else. But if they also want pens or shoes, that would conflict. So this might not be good.<br/><br/>Option 3: Propose 1 pen and 1 shoe. Then the other player could take 1 pen and 1 shoe. But that would require 2 pens and 2 shoes, which is possible. But I would get 4 + 1 = 5, and they get 4 + 1 = 5. Total 10. But maybe that&#x27;s better if they value shoes more. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 0 shoes. Then the other player could take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take fruits, but since fruits are worthless to me, maybe they don&#x27;t care. But if they take shoes, that&#x27;s 2 shoes. So that&#x27;s a possible split.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player&#x27;s proposal must be complementary. So if I propose 2 pens, and they propose 2 shoes, that&#x27;s okay. But if they propose something else, like 2 pens, then it&#x27;s not complementary.<br/><br/>So the key is to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted by the other player, and that together we can cover the items.<br/><br/>Since I don&#x27;t know their values, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and low value to them. But since I don&#x27;t know their values, this is tricky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me and see if the other player can take the rest. For example, if I take 2 pens, then the other player can take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take fruits, but since fruits are worthless to me, maybe they don&#x27;t care. But if they take shoes, that&#x27;s 2 shoes. So that&#x27;s a possible split.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose 2 pens and 2 shoes, but that would take all pens and shoes, leaving fruits. But if the other player also wants pens or shoes, that&#x27;s a conflict. So that&#x27;s risky.<br/><br/>Another thought: since the other player&#x27;s value function is secret, maybe I should make a proposal that is as good as possible for me, and hope that the other player can take the remaining items. For example, if I take 2 pens, then the other player can take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they would take fruits, but since fruits are worthless to me, maybe they don&#x27;t care. But if they take shoes, that&#x27;s 2 shoes. So that&#x27;s a possible scenario.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 1 shoe. Then the other player could take 1 shoe and 2 fruits. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I can only make a secret proposal, I need to decide what to propose. The best approach might be to propose the items I value most, which are pens. So proposing 2 pens. Then the other player can take the remaining items. If they take shoes and fruits, that&#x27;s good. If they take pens, that&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to take the risk.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 2 shoes. But that would take all pens and shoes, leaving fruits. If the other player can take fruits, but since they are worthless to me, maybe they don&#x27;t care. But if they also want pens or shoes, that&#x27;s a problem. So this is risky.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 pens and 0 shoes. Then the other player can take 2 shoes and 2 fruits. If they value shoes, that&#x27;s good. If they don&#x27;t, maybe they take fruits, but that&#x27;s not helpful. But since I don&#x27;t know, this is a gamble.<br/><br/>Another angle: the total value for me is 2 pens (8) + 2 shoes (2) = 10. If I can get all items, that&#x27;s 10. But if the other player also wants some items, that might not be possible. So maybe the best is to take as much as possible of the high-value items.<br/><br/>But since the other player&#x27;s proposal must be complementary, I need to make sure that my proposal and theirs don&#x27;t overlap. So if I propose 2 pens, they can propose 2 shoes and 2 fruits. That would be complementary. So that&#x27;s a possible scenario.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Pens, 0 Shoes, 0 Fruits]. Then the other player would have to propose something that doesn&#x27;t overlap. If they propose 2 Shoes and 2 Fruits, that&#x27;s good. Then I get 8, they get 2 (if their shoe value is 1 each). Total 10.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if they propose something else, like 2 Pens, then it&#x27;s not complementary. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to make the best guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose 2 Pens and 1 Shoe. Then the other player could take 1 Shoe and 2 Fruits. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the best one. Given that pens are my highest value, I should propose taking both pens. That way, I maximize my own score. Then the other player can take the remaining items. If they take shoes and fruits, that&#x27;s good. If they take pens, that&#x27;s a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do.<br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Proposal: 2 Pens]. That&#x27;s the first step. Then the other player would respond with their proposal. If their proposal is complementary, we both get points. Otherwise, zero.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the other player might not accept my proposal. For example, if they also want pens, they might propose 2 pens, leading to a conflict. But since I can&#x27;t know, I have to proceed with my best guess.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a mix. For example, 2 Pens and 1 Shoe. Then the other player could take 1 Shoe and 2 Fruits. But again, depends on their values.<br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard to optimize. So the safest bet is to propose the items I value most, which are pens. So I&#x27;ll go with [Proposal: 2 Pens].<br/></p>
