                    "content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players' scores. The items available are 1 phone, 2 mirrors, and 2 fruits. My value function is phone:4, mirror:2, fruit:1. The other player has their own secret values, which I don't know. \n\nFirst, I should consider possible allocations. Since there's only one phone, if both want it, there's a conflict. But maybe we can split the other items. The mirrors and fruits are in pairs, so maybe each can take one mirror and one fruit. But the phone is a single item. \n\nSince I don't know the other player's values, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be complementary. If I propose taking the phone, maybe the other player would take the mirrors and fruits. But if they also want the phone, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the phone and some mirrors, and they take the rest. \n\nWait, the rules say that if the proposals are complementary, meaning there are enough items for both, then both get their scores. Otherwise, both get zero. So the key is to make a proposal that, when combined with the other's proposal, doesn't exceed the available items. \n\nBut since I don't know the other's proposal, I need to make a proposal that's likely to be compatible. Maybe I should start by proposing something that covers most of the items, leaving some for the other player. For example, if I propose taking the phone and one mirror, then the other player could take the remaining mirror and both fruits. That would be complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose taking the phone and both mirrors, then the other player would need to take the fruits. But if they also want the phone, that's a conflict. \n\nBut since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be strategic. Maybe the first message should be a secret proposal. Let me think about the possible combinations. \n\nIf I propose [Phone, Mirror], then the other player could propose [Mirror, Fruit, Fruit]. That would work because there's 1 phone, 2 mirrors, 2 fruits. So my proposal takes 1 phone and 1 mirror, leaving 1 mirror and 2 fruits. The other's proposal would take 1 mirror and 2 fruits. That's complementary. \n\nAlternatively, if I propose [Phone, Mirror, Fruit], then the other could take [Mirror, Fruit]. That also works. \n\nBut I need to make sure that my proposal is such that the other player's possible proposal can complement it. Since I don't know their values, maybe I should propose items that are less valuable to me but more to them? Or maybe the other way around. \n\nWait, but since the goal is to maximize the sum, maybe I should propose items that are high value to me but not too high for the other. But without knowing their values, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose a balanced set. For example, taking the phone and one mirror. That way, the other player can take the remaining mirror and both fruits. That would be a good split. \n\nSo my first message could be a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror]. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust. \n\nBut the problem is that I can only send 5 messages. So I need to be efficient. Maybe start with a secret proposal. Let me check the rules again. \n\nThe secret proposal is in the format [Proposal: ...]. So I should make that first. If I do that, the other player might respond with their own proposal. If they are complementary, we get points. Otherwise, we get zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a regular message first to gauge their preferences. But the rules say that messages are sent to agree on the allocation. So maybe the first step is to make a secret proposal. \n\nBut the user is asking me to start the game. So I need to send my first message. Since I can make a secret proposal, maybe that's the best first step. \n\nSo my first message would be a secret proposal. Let me think about what to propose. If I take the phone and one mirror, that's 4 + 2 = 6 points for me. The other player could take the remaining mirror and two fruits, which would be 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 points. Total 10. \n\nAlternatively, if I take the phone and both mirrors, that's 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. The other player would take the two fruits, 1 + 1 = 2. Total 10. \n\nBut if the other player also wants the phone, then my proposal would conflict. But since I don't know their values, maybe it's better to propose a split that's likely to be compatible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should propose taking the phone and one mirror, and the other player can take the rest. That seems safe. \n\nSo I'll go with that. My first message is a secret proposal: [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror]. \n\nBut wait, the format requires numbers and object names. So it should be \"1 Phone, 1 Mirror\". \n\nYes. So the secret proposal would be [Proposal: 1 Phone, 1 Mirror]. \n\nI think that's a good start. Then, depending on their response, I can adjust. If they propose something that conflicts, maybe I can make another proposal. But since I can only send 5 messages, I need to be careful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should send a regular message first to ask about their preferences. But the rules say that messages are for agreeing on the allocation. So maybe the secret proposal is the way to go. \n\nYes, I think starting with a secret proposal is the right move here. Let me send that.\n",
