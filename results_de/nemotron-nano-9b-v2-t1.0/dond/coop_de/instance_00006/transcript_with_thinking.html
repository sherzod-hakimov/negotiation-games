        <p>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out how to approach this negotiation game. The goal is to maximize the sum of both players&#x27; scores. The items available are 1 potato, 1 glove, 2 rulers, 1 pipe, and 2 cards. My secret value function is: potato 0, glove 1, ruler 3, pipe 1, card 1. <br/><br/>First, I should understand what the other player&#x27;s value function might be. Since it&#x27;s secret, I can&#x27;t know for sure, but maybe I can make some assumptions. The key is to find a proposal that, when combined with the other player&#x27;s proposal, covers all items without overlap. If their proposal is complementary, both get points based on their own values. Otherwise, both get zero.<br/><br/>Since I can send up to 5 messages or make a secret proposal, I need to strategize. The best approach might be to make a secret proposal that covers items I value highly, hoping the other player&#x27;s proposal complements it. But I need to consider possible overlaps.<br/><br/>Looking at my values: rulers are the most valuable (3 each), then gloves and pipes and cards (1 each), and potatoes are worthless. So I should prioritize getting the rulers. There are two rulers, so if I can get both, that&#x27;s 6 points. But if the other player also wants them, we might have a conflict.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I can propose taking the rulers and some other items. Let me think. If I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2], that&#x27;s 6 points for me. But the other player might also propose rulers. If they do, then we can&#x27;t both get them, so both get zero. That&#x27;s bad. So maybe I should propose a combination that includes rulers but also other items that the other player might not value as much.<br/><br/>Wait, but I don&#x27;t know their values. Maybe I should propose items that I value highly and that are unique or have limited quantity. For example, the glove is only one, so if I take it, the other player can&#x27;t. Similarly, the pipe and cards are single or two. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that includes the rulers and some other items. Let&#x27;s say I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove]. That would give me 3+3+1=7 points. But if the other player also proposes rulers, then we can&#x27;t both get them. But if they don&#x27;t, then maybe they can take other items. However, if they also want the glove, then we have a conflict. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Pipe, Card 1]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8 points. But again, if the other player also wants rulers, it&#x27;s a problem. <br/><br/>But since I can only make a secret proposal once, I need to make sure that my proposal is as good as possible. Maybe the best is to take the two rulers and the glove. Because the glove is unique, and the rulers are high value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Card 1, Card 2]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. But again, same issue with rulers. <br/><br/>Wait, but the other player&#x27;s proposal is also secret. So if I make a secret proposal, they might make theirs. The key is that if our proposals are complementary, we both get points. So I need to make a proposal that is likely to be complementary with the other player&#x27;s. <br/><br/>But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe I should propose items that are less likely to be desired by the other player. For example, if I take the glove, which is only one, and the other player might not value it as much. But if they do, then we can&#x27;t both have it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the two rulers and the pipe. Since the pipe is only one, and maybe the other player doesn&#x27;t value it as much. <br/><br/>But I need to think about the possible combinations. Let me list all items and their quantities:<br/><br/>- Potato: 1<br/>- Glove: 1<br/>- Rulers: 2<br/>- Pipe: 1<br/>- Cards: 2<br/><br/>So total items: 1+1+2+1+2=7 items. Each player&#x27;s proposal must be a subset of these, and they must be complementary (i.e., no overlapping items). <br/><br/>If I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove], then the other player&#x27;s proposal must not include any of these. So they can take potato, pipe, and cards. But if their value function is such that they value the pipe or cards more, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Pipe], then the other player can take glove, potato, and cards. <br/><br/>But since I don&#x27;t know their values, I need to make an educated guess. Since my value for rulers is highest, I should definitely try to get them. <br/><br/>Another approach: maybe propose a set that includes the rulers and some other items that are less valuable to me but maybe the other player values more. But without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that is as comprehensive as possible, but that might conflict with the other player&#x27;s proposal. <br/><br/>Wait, the goal is to maximize the sum of both scores. So even if I get a high score, if the other player gets a low score, the total might not be optimal. But since I can&#x27;t know their values, maybe the best is to propose a set that covers high-value items for me and leaves items that the other player might value. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose a set that is complementary to what the other player might propose. But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s challenging. <br/><br/>Perhaps the best strategy is to propose the two rulers and the glove. That way, I get 3+3+1=7. If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include these, then they can take the remaining items. For example, if they propose [Potato, Pipe, Card 1, Card 2], then we have complementary proposals. <br/><br/>But if the other player also wants the rulers, then we can&#x27;t both get them. So maybe I should propose the rulers and some other items that are less likely to be desired. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the two rulers and the pipe. That&#x27;s 3+3+1=7. The other player could take the glove, potato, and cards. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a gamble. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should make a secret proposal that includes the rulers and the glove. Let me go with that. So my secret proposal would be [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove]. <br/><br/>If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then I get 7 points. If not, we both get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Card 1, Card 2]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. But again, same issue. <br/><br/>Wait, but if I take the two rulers and the two cards, that&#x27;s 8 points. The other player could take the glove and pipe. If they value those, then it&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But I don&#x27;t know. Maybe the other player values the glove more. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove, Pipe]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. But then the other player can only take the potato and cards. If they value the cards, that&#x27;s good. <br/><br/>But again, it&#x27;s a risk. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove, Card 1]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. The other player could take the pipe and card 2. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s hard. <br/><br/>Since I can only make one secret proposal, I need to choose the one that maximizes my expected score. Given that rulers are the highest value, I should definitely include them. Then, maybe add the glove and pipe, which are single items. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove, Pipe]. That&#x27;s 3+3+1+1=8. <br/><br/>If the other player&#x27;s proposal doesn&#x27;t include these, then we can both get points. If they do, then we get zero. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Card 1, Card 2]. That&#x27;s 8 points. <br/><br/>But I think the gloves and pipes are also valuable. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove, Card 1]. <br/><br/>But I need to decide. Since the goal is to maximize the sum, I should try to get as much as possible. <br/><br/>Another thought: if I take the two rulers, that&#x27;s 6 points. Then, if I can also get the glove and pipe, that&#x27;s 1+1=2, total 8. If the other player takes the cards, which are two, and the potato, which is 0. <br/><br/>But if the other player&#x27;s value function is such that they value the cards more, then they might take them. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if I take the two rulers and the two cards, that&#x27;s 8. The other player could take the glove and pipe. <br/><br/>But again, without knowing their values, it&#x27;s a guess. <br/><br/>Since I can&#x27;t know, maybe the safest is to propose the two rulers and the glove. That way, I get 7, and the other player can take the pipe and cards. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose the two rulers and the pipe. <br/><br/>But I think the glove is a single item, so if I take it, the other player can&#x27;t. <br/><br/>So, I think the best bet is to propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove]. That&#x27;s 7 points. <br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe I should propose [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove, Pipe]. <br/><br/>But I need to make a decision. Let me go with [Ruler 1, Ruler 2, Glove, Pipe]. That&#x27;s 8 points. <br/><br/>If the other player&#x27;s proposal is complementary, then we both get points. If not, we get zero. <br/><br/>But since I can&#x27;t know, this is the best I can do. <br/><br/>So my secret proposal would be: [Proposal: 1 Ruler, 2 Ruler, 1 Glove, 1 Pipe]<br/></p>
